Decorate the container.,
Use clear packing tape to seal everything onto the container.,
Wash the container.",How to Make Pet Food Dishes," The plastic containers should be food grade, durable and stable. Hence, the best ones are those containers that have held your own food initially and are strong enough to be reused, such as ice cream containers, or other frozen food storage containers. Avoid any containers that won't clean, are stained, appear weak, or that have any sharp edges. Never use containers that have had toxic products in them (which includes knowing which human foods are not good for pets) - stick to food grade containers only. When sizing, consider:

Cats - remember their whiskers, which are wide and sensitive. Cats need a shallow, wide container that doesn't obstruct their head access with whiskers included, but don't make the dish too deep. The water dish should be slightly deeper than the food dish.
Dogs - dogs need a dish that has enough room for a single meal. Things to think about include not having too large a dish to avoid the temptation to over-feed your dog, and floppy eared dogs should be give a dish that doesn't cause their ears fall into the meal. The water dish should be twice as big as the meal dish.;

Decide on surgical treatment.,
Allow aftercare to be done at the veterinary clinic or hospital.",How to Handle Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats1," It is likely that your veterinarian will want to give your cat medication to relieve its symptoms. Corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be administered to temporarily relieve symptoms right away. Your cat will likely be given oxygen as well to improve its breathing.

It is not good for cats to be on corticosteroids long term, as they can cause a lot of side effects. This makes them only a good short term solution for brachycephalic airway syndrome.;
, Surgery is typically the preferred treatment for brachycephalic airway syndrome. However, depending on the exact airway irregularities your cat has, surgical treatment will vary and it may need one or more of procedures.

In order to fix stenotic nares, the surgeon will remove a section of tissue from the animal's nostrils.
An soft palate that is too long can be shortened by a veterinary surgeon.
If your cat has everted laryngeal saccules that are obstructing its larynx, these can be surgically removed in most cases.

, After a cat has surgery for brachycephalic airway syndrome, they will likely have more difficulty breathing while they recover, as the surgical area will be swollen. Because of this, it is important that the cat remain under veterinary supervision until swelling goes away and breathing is improved."

, Cats that have problems breathing can have even more trouble when they are too hot. If you live in a warm climate, be sure that your cat has a cool place to spend its day.

Hot and humid weather can often make the symptoms of brachycephalic airway syndrome worse., A cat that has this condition has a harder time getting oxygen into its system.

Look for signs in flat-faced cats.,
Notice mouth breathing.,
Listen for noisy breathing.,
Recognize fainting spells.,
Get veterinary care as early as possible.,
Allow recommended testing.,
Discuss the diagnosis with your cat's veterinarian.",How to Handle Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats3," Brachycephalic airway syndrome is a problem in cats that have flat faces. Their flat faces make abnormalities much more likely because there is less room in the cat's head for proper airway development.Persian, Himalayan and Burmese cats are more likely to get brachycephalic airway syndrome than other breeds.

, When a cat cannot breathe very well it is common for it to open its mouth to breathe. This signals that the cat is having difficulty getting enough air in through its nose.A cat will normally breathe through its nose most of the time if its airway is clear.

, Noisy breathing is another sign of trouble in your cat's airway. Noisy breathing happens when the airway is obstructed and air does not have a clear pathway.This can happen when the cat is congested due to sickness, but it can also signal that the airway is compromised if it does not go away once the cat is well.

, In extreme cases of brachycephalic airway syndrome your cat may faint due to lack of oxygen. This signals that the condition is life threatening and and the cat needs veterinary care immediately.It can be difficult to tell the difference between when a cat is sleeping and when it has passed out. However, if you can't wake your cat up easily, then it has likely passed out.

, If you suspect that your cat has difficulty breathing due to brachycephalic airway syndrome, you should have it seen by a veterinarian as soon a possible. If your cat is having a particularly hard time breathing, you should have it seen by a veterinarian immediately.The earlier that the condition is identified and treated, the better the chances are for successful treatment.
If your regular veterinary clinic is not open when you notice your cat's breathing problems, take it to an emergency veterinary clinic or hospital.

, There are a variety of tests that may be done on your cat if their veterinarian suspects brachycephalic airway syndrome. Some of these tests can be done while the cat is awake, but some need to be done while the cat is put under anesthesia.

If your cat needs to be put under to have testing done, your veterinarian will do a variety of tests on it first to make sure that it is healthy enough to undergo anesthesia. Cats with breathing problems can have a hard time under anesthesia, so your vet will want to use extra care when putting the cat under.
If your cat is put under anesthesia to have testing done, your veterinarian may suggest that any surgical treatments that need to be done are done then as well. This will limit the risks to your cat that are inherent with anesthesia.

, Brachycephalic airway syndrome is actually a group of abnormalities of the airway. If your veterinarian tells you that your cat has this syndrome, they will then discuss your cat's specific abnormalities within the larger syndrome. There are four types of abnormalities that are included in this syndrome. They include:Stenotic nares: abnormally narrowed, small nostrils
Elongated soft palate: the soft palate is too long for the length of the cat's mouth, blocking the entrance to the trachea or windpipe
Eversion of the laryngeal saccules: sacs or pouches inside the voicebox that go into the airway and inhibit normal airflow
Narrowing of the trachea : the trachea is a smaller diameter than normal

If the trauma looks severe, such as a protruding bone, then try to stop your pet from moving and immediately take it to the closest veterinary clinic or emergency veterinary hospital.;
, Make sure to give your pet some food and a fresh bowl of water right away. If they do not want the food and/or water, then this could indicate that something is wrong. Be sure to mention this to your veterinarian.


After your pet eats/drinks, give them a chance to use the bathroom and see if they are passing fluid and feces normally. Check after they go to see if there is any blood. If they seem distressed or are not passing anything, then mention this to your veterinarian as well.

, Just because you can't see a problem that doesn't mean there isn't one under your pet's fur. Feel all over its body for odd or unusual bumps. If your pet moves uncomfortably when you touch a certain area, this too can be a sign of injury.


Some pets, such as cuddly puppies, will usually be more than happy to let you feel all over their body. However, standoffish cats or crotchety old dogs may be more resistant. In cases such as these, do the best you can and then let the pet's veterinarian do a more thorough examination.

, Gently pinch a section of skin behind their shoulder blades and check to see if it snaps back. It should snap back right away if your pet is well hydrated. If not, then the skin may stick and slowly go back into place.


Take your pet to see a veterinarian immediately if you suspect dehydration.

, You can also check your pet for blood loss by looking at their gums. Gently slide your pet’s lip down and look at the color of their gums. If the gums are white or pale pink, then they may have lost some blood. If the gums look pink, press one finger against their gums and note how long it takes for the blood to return. It should take no more than 2 seconds. If it takes longer than this, then their circulation may be sluggish and they may be in shock.


Take your pet to see a veterinarian if you suspect blood loss or poor circulation.

, While a pet is bound to be a little out of sorts when readjusting to home after being lost, there are some behaviors that signal ill health more than readjustment. Watch your pet after it gets home to see if its behavior is relatively normal or if there might be something wrong with it health-wise.For example, a lack of appetite or a hesitance to let you touch it, when you could before, might signal a health problem that needs to be addressed


Also, if your pet is unsteady on its feet, when it is normally steady, or it is bumping into stuff, it may have some sort of injury that needs treatment.

, You will need to judge whether the injuries you have found are life threatening or if they simply need care but will not risk your pet's life. In order to make this assessment, you can call your veterinary office or call your local animal hospital if your usual clinic is closed.If injuries are life threatening, take your pet to its veterinarian or to an animal hospital immediately. Call the office on the way there to tell them what is going on and to allow them to prepare for your arrival.
If the injuries do not seem life threatening but need veterinary care, call your veterinary office or your local animal hospital and explain the situation. They will advise you whether to bring the pet in immediately or to wait for an appointment.

, If you don't find anything wrong with your pet after you get it back, you can still have it looked over just for peace of mind. It may have an injury or health issue that you cannot detect. Make an appointment for a time that is convenient for you and tell the veterinary office why you are bringing the pet in.


If your pet has not had its regular annual appointment, this is a good time to go ahead and schedule that. Your veterinarian will assess the pet's overall health and make sure it is up to date on vaccinations and medications., With a thorough exam, your veterinarian should be able to detect any problems that started when your pet was lost.Once your pet has been assessed by a veterinarian, you should follow the treatment recommendations they give you. It may be that they tell you that your pet is just fine. However, they may prescribe medications or suggest some sort of veterinary procedure that your pet needs.


It is appropriate to discuss treatment options with the veterinarian. Ask any questions that you have and discuss the cost of procedures and medications before you agree to them.

Learn about them.,
If you go to school and have an essay, a poem to write, or a long, detailed story for homework, you might like to base it on horses.

,
If you have the money and the time, you might like to buy a horse.,
When in conversation with your friends, you might like to add in a few horse facts.,
Collect model horses.,
Whenever you see something with a horse on it, go crazy.,
Decorate your room with horses.,
Whenever you make a wish list, make most of the items horse-related.

",How to Show Your Love of Horses," If you're just starting to be horse crazy, research online about horses and find out the definitions of horse words like furlong, hands and martingale. You might like to research the different colors, breeds, and markings of horses as well.;
,, Remember though, as amazing as galloping on a beach on a beautiful Thoroughbred at sunset may sound, stick to the basics. You may be plodding round a soggy school at the back to a group in the pouring rain, but if you're truly horse crazy then it shouldn't really bother you. Make sure you check out the yard, the horses and maybe watch a lesson before you start there. The horse you will be riding and grooming should be trained in the four gaits (walk, trot, canter and gallop) and recognize the word 'stop' or 'whoa' so you can ride it safely with a good mind set. If you are a beginner, you should be riding a 'bombproof' horse that's roughly 8 years old.

, Don't, however, bore them with all you know about horses. They will know that you are horse crazy, but they'll probably become bored if they aren't into horses as much as you. They could become upset if all you ever talk about is horses because they may think you like horse more than your human friends (which you might, but don't tell them that!). This could result in arguments and all of you being upset. Instead, make friends that enjoy riding too. Someone that enjoys it as much as you will understand!

, Show your collection off to your friends.

, Jump up and down and yell ""horses!""

, Horse bedding, horse posters, horse wallpaper, horse rug, horse stuffed animals, anything.

Gather the necessary supplies, as shown below.
,
Locate the area you would like to shoot in.,
Observe the location and figure out the best lighting.,Clean and polish any tack that the horse may wear, especially any metal pieces or colored parts, as these really stand out in a photograph.,
Groom the horse well.,Remove all the dust from the horse's coat, and spray the horse with a shining product for the most glamorous photo.,Apply clear hoof polish after cleaning the hooves.,Clip the horse's long facial whiskers, ear hair, bridle path and fetlock hair, and then apply a light coat of equine highlighter to the muzzle, eye area and ears.,
Brush out the mane and tail, and braid or band the mane if you wish.,Bring the horse on location and decide on the best background for your photo.,
To take an action shot, let the horse loose (in a fenced area, of course!,
To take a posed shot, bring your horse to the area where you want the shot to be taken.,
Focus your camera appropriately.,
Time your shots.,
Shoot many, many pictures.,
Have fun with it.",How to Take Great Horse Photography,", Clean up any debris, manure, or other unsightly items. Also, check for any unsafe things, like nails or broken glass, that the horses could step on., Unless you are equipped with professional photography lights, natural lighting is the best. Early morning or late evening light is the most flattering, but check that there is enough light to take a picture without the flash.



  Watching the world go by.

,, If you want to bathe it, do it the day before, so that the natural oils in the coat will return to give the horse a healthy sheen.,,,, Spray both with a detangler so as to avoid clumped hair in your final shot.,,), take a lunge whip and pop it on the ground to get the horses moving. Pop it as many times as needed to get the horse at the pace you need. It helps to have one or two helpers doing this so that you can get a still shot., Have a helper hold a carrot or other treat just out of the camera shot to position the horse's head and make him prick his ears., Many cameras have a portrait setting that is perfect for posed shots, and some also have an action setting that works nicely for action shots., For a portrait, this is not quite as essential, but for a motion shot, try to catch the horse when he is airborne, with legs fully extended, or with legs fully contracted. Mid-stride shots are usually not very attractive., Shoot at different angles and sides, and shoot a lot. When the shoot is over, you will have many more photos to choose from when picking out the best ones.

, Experiment with different styles. Make it your own."
"
When attempting to deal with any animal, the best approach is to understand how it communicates and thus communicate with it.,

Always approach the horse from the side.,
Move toward the horse gradually, talking to it in a low, soothing voice as you do so.,
When you are near the horse, slow down and imitate a nicker as well as you can.,
Reach out your hand, making sure that your fingers are pressed together and not splayed out.",How to Pet a Wild Horse," You need to get to know exactly how horses act, and what their actions mean so you can 'talk' to them using their communication system.;
, A horse's eyes are on the sides of its head, so it cannot see directly in front or behind. If a horse can sense you but can't see you, it will probably get spooked and might accidentally injure you., Make sure you're very calm and cautious, as any sudden movements or loud noises may startle the horse.

, This body language will be interpreted as ""I won't harm you"" by the horse. Continue to approach the horse in this position until you are close enough to touch it.

, Gently stroke the horse's neck. If he resists at first, stop for awhile, while talking to him in a soothing voice. Then, try again.


If every time you touch him he runs or trots away (sometimes horses who don't want to be caught will do this), sit down in the pasture or corral facing away from the horse and just wait. Do not do this if your horse has a tendency to kick, or move carelessly and might injure you. Most horses are very curious, so he should gradually come towards you, making sure that you don't notice him. If after 5 minutes or so of no progress, get a treat, hold it, and try again. Remember not to give your horse the treat until he at least lets your rest your palm on him.

Distract your dog from the loud noise that is going on outside.,
Create a safe, well-known environment that your dog is used to.,
Train your dog to not fear thunder.,
If you've attempted many times to stop your dog's fear of thunder, medication is always a possible option.,
Don't punish your dog when it gets frightened.,
Don't try to force your dog to overcome that fear.,
Do NOT comfort your dog and cuddle him.",How to Handle a Pet's Fear of Thunderstorms1," You can do this by putting on the radio or the television at a volume that isn't too loud, but gently drowns out the thunder. You can also distract your dog by playing a game with them, such as fetch, or handing them a chew which will last a while; I would recommend a Kong.;
, If your dog insists on crawling under the table, let it stay there - don't force it to do something it really doesn't want to. Don't confine your dog to certain areas too. Make it feel comfortable and at home. It is bad if your dog feels like you are not paying enough attention to him/her.

, You can do this by purchasing a CD which is a recording of a storm. Play this at a low volume at first. Reward your dog when they show no sign of fear. Slowly increase the volume of the CD and keep rewarding your dog with treats when they show less sign of fear.

, Your vet can prescribe this. But firstly, you must consider your dog's welfare: Is it worth him/her being drowsy and calm? Or should you stick to your dog being frightened and potentially putting itself or others at risk?

, This will only upset and confuse it even more.

, For example: making it stay in the garden throughout the storm - this is just cruel!

, Through a dog's eyes, when it gets scared of thunder and comes to you or hides, you give it attention - the dog likes this and realises that next time when there is thunder, you'll give it a long cuddle. This will only make it's fear worse.

"

Pretty similar to handling a dog during thunderstorms.,
Cats are different to dogs in that they are regularly allowed outside whenever they please.,
If your cat is not indoors when a thunderstorm starts, DON'T go out looking for it.,
Cats are much more independent than dogs.,
There are certain medications out there that you can give to your cat before a thunderstorm to help prevent it from becoming stressed out.,
Similar to a dog; don't punish your cat when it gets frightened.

,
Don't try to force your cat to overcome it's fear, for example by making it stay outside.

,
Do NOT comfort your cat.",How to Handle a Pet's Fear of Thunderstorms2," Firstly, try to distract the cat's attention from the thunder. Play games with it or give it a chew that will last a long time, to keep it's mind focused on something other than the storm.

, If your cat is indoors when a thunderstorm starts, keep it inside. Block the cat flap and shut the windows so it can't escape. Even if it goes crazy trying to scratch it's way through the front door, keep it inside. This prevents it from any dangers when running around, frightened, outside.

, It could have it's own comfortable place elsewhere where it prefers to be during a thunderstorm. Also, if you're outside looking for it, it may come running through the cat-flap looking for you. Just stay indoors and wait for it to return, if it wants to.

, When they get scared of a thunderstorm allow them to sit or lie wherever they prefer to, not outside of course, and do not disturb them until the thunderstorm is over.

, Your vet can prescribe this.

,,, If you cuddle it, you're only giving it attention, which it likes. So, next time there is a thunderstorm, it will come to you for comfort - this is only making the problem worse!

"
"
Put on the radio or the television.,
It's not easy at all, if even possible, to train a rodent to not fear thunderstorms.,
Like all pets, rodents eventually recognise their owner, so if you're present during the thunderstorm, they won't become as frightened.

,
Only give your rodent a few tasty treats; too many will probably be unhealthy for your little pet.

,
Don't try to handle your rodent during a thunderstorm.,
Remember, rodents have smaller ears than you do, and can hear things a lot louder.,
Do not give your rodent lots of treats and snacks for it to eat during the thunderstorm to take it's mind off it.",How to Handle a Pet's Fear of Thunderstorms3," A good source of background noise will drown out the thunder, so your rodent won't hear it.

, The simplest thing to do is to bring them inside, if they live outside, and keep them in a lit room - darkness will probably scare them more.

,,, The last thing they probably want is to be picked up. They may try to defend themselves and bite you otherwise.

, So, don't turn your background music up too loud - you don't want to aggravate them even more.

, This will just make it realise that if it's scared during a thunderstorm, it'll receive tasty snacks.

Understand what you're looking for.,
Head west.,
Find East coast populations.,
Head north.,
Find nature preserves and National Parks where you can look.,
Understand how horses are handled.,
Leave feral horses alone.,
Never attempt to capture wild horses.",How to Find Wild Horses1," Most ""wild"" horses are actually feral horses, or domestic breeds that are no longer domesticated. Real wild horses are very rare. The Przewalski horse, found in Mongolia, is one of the only real wild horses left in the world. Most free-roaming horses are actually feral, not wild. Some types include Spanish mustangs, Dartmoor hill ponies, and New Forest ponies. These are the type of horses you'll find in the United States.


Wild horses come in all shapes and sizes, from ponies to full-grown Mustangs, from white to brown to black and every color in between.;
, In the United States, managed populations of feral horses still exist in a variety of locations, all of them in the far West, Mountain Regions, and Southwest. In these places, the land is still less developed. According to some estimates there are as many as 40-50,000 wild horses in the United States.If you want to find wild horses in the US, look in the following states:


Nevada
Wyoming
Utah
Oregon
California
Colorado
Idaho
Arizona
Montana
North Dakota
New Mexico

, Some feral populations live in the salt marshes and dunes on the other coast as well. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all house feral herds on park land. The Outer Banks are particularly known for their wild populations of horses.


Shackleford Banks, one of the islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore, is home to over 100 wild horses. This is one of the easiest ways to see wild horses, available for regular tours from the National Parks Service.

, Some herds of wild horses live in the Canadian west, in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan. There are also horses on Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia. Some Island herds are rounded up and the foals are auctioned off yearly.

, The best way to find a good wild horse location is to pick a state that's close to you, then find a National Park or nature preserve that manages a wild horse population that you can visit.Some parks with wild herds include:


Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado
Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota
Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in Northern Nevada
Jicarilla in New Mexico
Devils Garden in California

, Feral populations in North America are typically closely monitored. The BLM administers American horses, which are regularly rounded up and made available for adoption. These horses are held at BLM facilities until they are picked out and adopted.


There is a ""Mustang Challenge"" every year, during which horse trainers are provided with a 3 or 4 year old gelding to train in a short period of time. After a competition, the horses are auctioned off. The proceeds help maintain the remaining captured Mustangs.
Canadian authorities consider wild herds nuisance animals. Sometimes, horses are rounded up by ranchers or simply shot to preserve the grass for cattle. There are groups dedicated to their preservation. But since the horses are not truly ""wild,"" the government has very little interest in them.

, It is very important to keep a good distance from feral ponies. This is for your own safety as well as the horse. Feral animals are not used to humans. They may also carry infectious diseases, or react violently to your presence.


Never attempt to feed wild horses. This can make them dependant on humans, putting them more at risk. If you find feral horses that look underweight, call a local authority. They should contact the herd owner or a charity that will try to get an appropriate food source to them safely.
Observing horses living free is a privilege. Remember their safety and your own makes the experience even better. Interacting with them will only ruin future visits for you and others. You want to see them living wild, not make them dependant on humans.

, In the United States and elsewhere, capturing feral or wild horses is a federal crime, and may only be done by representatives of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).It's also extremely dangerous for you and for the horse, often resulting in serious injury or death.


If you want to pet a horse or pony, try to find your local riding stables. You should be able to go and meet some domesticated horses and give them as much attention as you want.

Find wild Przewalskis in Mongolia.,
Find wild horses in the UK.,
Find wild horses across Europe and Asia.",How to Find Wild Horses2," While populations suffered at one point, this most famous of the latter day wild horses has been reintroduced into Mongolia. They can be found in a variety of locations in the country., In the UK, many feral ponies can be found on moorlands, and a few National Parks. Dartmoor, Exmoor, the New Forest, Bodmin moor and elsewhere have been known for wild-running horses.


These are not wild horses, but horses that are owned and allowed to run wild across the moorlands. Usually, they'll only having human contact if they are ill, need to be castrated, or are being sold at market.
In the UK Dartmoor in Devon is a very easy place to find Dartmoor ponies. With little fences by roads you can even find a herd of ponies crossing the road on Dartmoor. Drive carefully.

, Feral populations are managed in a variety of European countries, much the same as they are in the United States.If you live in any of the following countries, you can find wild horses near you:

Tack.,
Use them in a conversation.",How to Know Basic Equine Vocabulary," Tack is the gear you use for a horse. Examples are the saddle, bridle, halter, etc.



 


Walk, trot, canter, and gallop. These four words, as you may already know, are the four natural gaits of a horse. If you're riding Western, it is the walk, jog, lope, and gallop. The walk is the slowest, and the gallop is the fastest.






Some specific breeds have their own unique gaits, other than the main four. As an example, Tennessee Walking Horses can do the 'running walk', and Standardbreds can do the 'pace'.

Conformation. The structure and general make-up of a horse






Cold-Blooded. Designating any horse or breed of horse without Arabian or eastern blood in its breeding. In practice, since many so-called cold-blooded breeds have been improved by the use of Arab blood, the distinction is based mainly on physical type: broadly, all heavy draft horses and most European native ponies are classed as cold-blooded.






Farrier. A person trained professionally to tend to a horses hooves.






Frog. V-shaped area found on bottom of horses hooves.






Withers. Point at the bottom of the neck. This is usually characterized by a slightly raised area - just above the shoulders. The saddle lays just behind this. A horses height is measured from the ground to the withers

Eye colours: To help tell the different colours apart, though not common, these names may appear: Eye wall, blue eye, teal eye, glass eye, white sclera. Horses can have blue, brown, green, hazel, gold, and red eyes.






Other important features of a horse's colour include: Spots, patches, predominant and base coat.





;
, Within each subcategory, there are mixtures and variations. Here are some colours and distinguishing points.


Bay: Various shades of brown body colour with black points. There are many types of bay; light bay (the brown is of a light shade), blood bay (the brown has a very deep red tone), mahogany bay (where the brown has a dark purple tinge, usually sooty and more brown), standard bay (where the brown is ""flat"", no red tinge), golden bay (where the base coat takes on a yellow color), and primitive or ""wild"" bay (the black markings are faint, and the horse usually has obvious dangerous characteristics).






Chestnut or Sorrel: Chestnut or sorrel is defined as a horse with no black hairs. Chestnut is a dark red horse. Very dark chestnuts are called liver chestnuts. Sorrels are more brightly colored, with a lighter coat color. For either, the mane/tail should be the same color as the body. Either color with flaxen mane and tails should have ""Flaxen"" put in front of the name. Sorrels are often flaxen.






Liver chestnut: They are a dark chestnut red-brown colour, appearing to have black in their coat - but they do not. The individual hairs are just very dark red. These horses can also have a flaxen or taffy mane and tail.






Black: There is no other color on the horse except black; all points and hairs are black (except for any white markings). Mane and Tail are black. There are a few types of black; Pitch or Raven black, which never fades - Black, which fades in the sun - and smokey black, where the horse looks black at a distance, but closer the horse has a brown tinge.






Grey or White grey: These horses may look white, but they are not. Their skin is dark and they have dark pigmentation around their eyes, ears and nose. They are born another color, and fade progressively with age.






Dapple grey: These horses are still grey, but have 'dapples'. Dapples are little lighter or darker spots. A normal dapple grey is grey with lighter spots; however an 'inverted' dapple grey is grey with darker spots. Dapple greys can be very light and very dark.






Steel grey: This color is when a horse is dark grey, usually with slightly darker points. They have no dappling.






Flea-bitten Grey: It looks like it sounds -- imagine a horse that has been bitten by fleas. It looks like it has tiny black, brown, or red spots about the size of a few pinheads. Their mane and tail will be grey or white and there will often be variations of these colours by way of shades.






Rose Grey: A chestnut horse that has turned grey. They have a purple, red, or brown tinge to their coats throughout the greying process. They can have dapples. Their manes are darker than the coat color.






Duns: Duns come in many colors, such as Red (dun and chestnut/sorrel), Grullo (black horse with dun factor, black points and faded grey to dark brown body), bay (bay horse with dun factor), and Mouse (dun on a Brown horse; very murky tan coloring). Duns have a face mask (dark face), dorsal stripe, leg barring(zebra stripes on the legs), dark points, and dark mane/tails. They are not to be confused with Buckskins, which only come in one color.







, They have a yellow base color (ranging from dark gold to yellow) and black legs/black points similar to a Bay. Their mane and tail is black. They can be dappled.


Palominos: These should be less than 20% black. Palominos typically have a lighter color main/tail than their bodies, but can be near the same shade; their shades range from cream to a near chocolate. They are commonly mistaken for champagnes.






Dilutes: Come in many varying degrees of colour and pigmentation. Many people think of Dilutes as Albino, when in fact they are not. A dilute is Perlino, Cremello, and Champagne. Cremellos are a Dilute of Chestnut, Perlino of Bay and Smokey Cream on Black. The cream gene is a dominant gene, and for a Cremello, Perlino or Smokey, there must be two cream genes present in the parents. If only one is present, a chestnut would then be Palomino with white main and tail and with a dark pigmented horse such as Bay you would get a Palomino with a black mane and tail. Cremellos have Blue eyes. Champagne is another dilution gene that acts on the base color of a horse to produce a lighter color. It is a dominant gene, so one or two genes have the same affect, and a horse must have a champagne parent to be a champagne. The champagne gene dilutes red pigment to a yellow color, and black pigment to a chocolate grayish color that is sometimes mistaken for grulla. They have freckled skin, and green/hazel/golden eyes.






Albinos: These horses are actually from a recessive gene. Many people think of them a Dilutes. They are known as Dominant Whites when registered, and the Albinos are commonly born with Pink or red pigmented eyes and pink non pigmented skin. They often look the same as Cremellos, however, they have a different genetic makeup and research shows the Albinism comes from a Recessive gene, compared to Perlino and Cremello have a Dominant gene.






Roan: Roans are a solid colour with white flecking throughout the coat. They come in many colours: Strawberry is a Chestnut colour with white flecking making it seem pink. A Blue Roan is a black with white flecks giving a blue tinge. A red Roan is bay with white flecks giving it a red look. Their manes and tails correspond with their base coat, but can be flaxen for strawberry roans, and other roans can have frosting (where the top of the mane/tail is very light in color).






Brown: This is a basic colour and really a Brown horse is well - brown. The exact genetics of brown are not very well understood. They are not the same as chestnut or black. The only defined type of brown is seal brown, where the base color is very dark and they have pangare type markings, where the belly/croup/muzzle/eye area is much lighter in color.






Pinto: Pintos are known for their irregular patterning, which is a modifying white gene. They come in many variations, such as piebald (black and white, large irregular patches of white), skewbald (same as piebald, except base color is anything but black), tobiano (white markings are irregular, and cross over the topline, have white legs), overo (large irregular circles never crossing the topline, usually have bald face and solid legs), tovero (mixture of tobiano and overo), frame overo (overo, but white splotches never cross topline or bottomline), splash (the bottom part of the horse and legs are white, as if they were dipped in white paint), and sabino (where the edge of the markings have roan characteristics). They can occur on any base color.






Paint: Paints are actually a colour breed. They are basically pinto coloured with either Quarter Horses registry but may also have Thoroughbred breeding as well. They also come in all the variations that pintos do. Their patches are large and do not go from side to side. To be a Pinto or a Paint,their leg markings should be past their hocks and knees if no main coloration occurs.






Appaloosa or Spotted: No Appaloosa has the same patterning of spots. Appaloosas come in a wide variety of colours, but the basic patterns include: Snowflake, Blanket, Few Spot, Solid, Leopard, varnish roan, and Snowcap. They have a white sclera and always have striped hooves and spotted genitalia and muzzle.







, Next time you look at a horse, pinpoint the markings that can provide you with clues to what colour it is and check against this list.

Consider the services offered and the vet’s popularity.",How to Find a Mobile Veterinary Service," It may be that there is a mobile veterinarian operating in your area, or within a close enough radius that the vet could come to your address. Using your preferred search engine, search to see if you are near any established mobile veterinarians. For example, search for:


“Mobile veterinary service near Lincoln, Nebraska”
“Is there a mobile veterinarian near zip code 80226”
“Mobile veterinarian in northern Delaware”;
, If you would like to have a better idea of the physical location—and proximity to your address—of nearby mobile veterinary services, you can search for one using the Maps page of a browser. Navigate to Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, Bing Maps, or a similar browser-based online map. Then, type in a nearby town or your zip code, followed by the phrase “nearby mobile veterinary service.”


Keep in mind that, since mobile veterinarians travel to their clients, their home office does not need to be close to you. For example, a mobile veterinary service may be willing to travel over 50 miles to treat an animal.

, There are a few websites that collect and list information about veterinary offices nationwide, to give animal owners the ability to search among existing vet offices near their locations. Some of these veterinary websites also allow users to search for mobile veterinary services near their location. For example, Veterinarians.com allows you to input your zip code, and will bring up any mobile vet services within that area.Veterinarians.com will also provide you with a phone number for the mobile vet service.

, If you’re struggling to find a mobile veterinarian operating in your area, try calling an established veterinary office and ask if they can recommend a mobile veterinary service. If you’re concerned that the vet will be hesitant to give out a competitor’s name, you could explain that you live in a rural area and it’s impractical to drive to a physical veterinary office.


You can find nearby veterinary offices through an online search using your preferred search engine. Or, if you still have a physical phonebook, flip to “Veterinarian” in the white pages.

, If any of your friends or members of your social circle have pets, ask if they have used a mobile veterinary service for their animal. It may be that different friends have used different mobile vets, and you’ll be able to hear first-hand accounts of multiple mobile veterinarians.


You don’t necessarily need to limit your area of inquiry to friends alone. For example, if you have work colleagues with pets, ask them if they have used a mobile vet service in the past.

, Some—but not all—mobile veterinary services will come to your house in order to vaccinate or examine your animal. This is especially common in rural, agricultural communities in which livestock such as cows, pigs, horses, and other large animals need veterinary care. In fact, some mobile veterinary services will specialize and only treat certain types of animals—horses, for example.While you can contact the mobile veterinarian through any means that they list on their website—phone number, email, etc.—a phone call will be the quickest method.

, Many mobile veterinarians serve a large enough client base that making house calls would be logistically difficult. These vet services often travel to a handful of clinics within the community, and ask animal owners to bring their pets to the vet. When you contact the mobile service, ask them where they set up clinics within the community, and inquire about the specific dates on which veterinary services will be offered.Many mobile veterinary services will also have an online calendar that shows the locations and dates of their upcoming veterinary clinics.

, It’s common for mobile veterinary services to set up weekly or monthly clinics at animal shelters. Animal shelters can provide the space and facilities for the mobile vet to treat animals. Ask the mobile vet service if they set up clinics at animal shelters, and ask if the office can provide you with a schedule of when and where these clinics take place.If you do not yet have a pet but are planning to adopt one, this could provide a good opportunity to get your pet spayed or neutered and vaccinated.
You may even be able to adopt a pet from a shelter where a mobile veterinary service has set up a clinic, and have the pet examined the same day.

, These are among the most basic of veterinary services, and are ones that all mobile veterinary services will provide. Before you schedule a house call with a mobile veterinary service, or plan to visit a clinic at an animal shelter, call ahead and make sure that they have the vaccine that your pet needs. Or, confirm that the vet can provide a checkup for your pet.Mobile vets will typically have the necessary medical equipment to take your animal’s temperature, and to monitor their pulse, blood pressure, and blood oxygen levels.

, While not all mobile veterinary services will perform parasite control or offer pet microchip installations, some will be happy to do so. This depends primarily on the medical equipment that the mobile vet travels with. Also ask if the veterinary team will perform any dental operations.If you need a service that the mobile vet you’re speaking with does not offer, ask them if they can recommend another mobile service that will perform it.

, If you have an older animal whose poor health would make it difficult or painful for them to travel to a veterinary office, you can ask a mobile vet service if they provide at-home euthanasia. Some services which do not typically offer house calls may be willing to make an exception in the case of euthanasia.Some mobile veterinary services will offer a cremation service as well. For a fee, they will take your euthanized pet and have them cremated at an animal-cremation facility.

, When evaluating a veterinarian, the primary questions are if they have a good rapport with your pet and if the service is effective. The veterinarian should show medical expertise, and should have the necessary veterinary equipment to effectively treat your pet.


If the vet has difficult in treating your animals (for example, struggles to make a diagnosis or give a vaccine) or if your animal reacts to the vet with uncharacteristic hostility, you should begin looking for another mobile vet service.

, If the veterinarian makes a house call, make sure that they arrive on time and behave in a professional manner. Vets—and any accompanying technicians—should treat you, your house, and your animal with respect. If you’re seeing the veterinarian at a clinic, make sure that the space is clean and well-lit, and that the vet treats you and the other clients and animals respectfully.


For example, if the vet is 5 minutes late to a house call, that’s no reason to discontinue using their service. But, if the vet shows up 45 minutes late and acts unprofessionally, you may need to look for a different mobile service.

, Generally speaking, if a business is popular, it indicates that the service provided is worthwhile and cost-effective. That said, if the mobile veterinarian you are evaluating sets up clinics that are overwhelmed with clients, you may need to look for a service with which you can schedule an appointment more easily.


Conversely, if you are the only client currently using a vet service, evaluate if there are flaws or problems keeping other clients away.

Visit an equine discussion forum for general information.,
Look for video tutorials on specific issues.,
Visit an animal society page for horse care instructions.,
Visit a breed registry or seller for information on buying a horse.,
Visit an online biological resource for scientific information.,
Fill in knowledge gaps with search engine queries.",How to Get Free Information About Horses1," If you're looking for free horse information online, a good all-in-one resource to start with is a horse discussion forum. At these sites, experienced horse caretakers, professionals, and newcomers alike have a space to discuss all things ""horse."" Odds are that if you can't get your question answered on a horse forum, you can at least get pointed in the right direction.


One very active horse forum is located (appropriately) at horseforum.com.With tens of thousands of threads on topics like horse health, horse grooming, horse training, and much, much more, it's likely that any question you might have has already been answered.
Other great forums include the official forums at the Chronicle of the Horse and the community forums at community.horse.com.;
, Believe it or not, streaming video sites (especially YouTube) can be a great source of information on horses. For instance, if you're trying to figure out how to accomplish a specific task (like shoe your horse), there will likely be at least several video tutorials submitted by users for you to browse through. These sorts of DIY video guides are fantastic for beginners because they show you what to do, rather than explaining it through walls of text.


Note that YouTube also has several full-length documentaries on horses available (including The Path of the Horse) which are great for supplemental information.

, Societies and charities dedicated to the well-being of animals have a natural interest in providing free, high-quality care instructions for animals. If you're looking for information on how to care for a horse humanely or trying to figure out what sorts of responsibilities you'd have if you got a horse, these sites can be very valuable resources.


The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a valuable resource for information on properly caring for a wide range of animals including horses. With tips on general care, nutrition, behavior, and preparing for potential problems, the ASPCA's horse resources have plenty to offer newcomers.Similarly, the British Horse Society, the largest equestrian charity in the UK, has a huge range of horse care guides available online., Horses aren't as easy to buy as, for instance, cars — there a number of precautions and preparations a prospective buyer must make before she even brings her new horse home. If you're looking on information for what to expect after buying a horse or the accommodations you'll need to make to be able to buy one, try visiting the sites of the agencies that breed, sell, and register horses.


For example, the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a horse breed registry, offers an extremely detailed guide covering the most important basics of buying a horse, including determining which type of horse to buy and making housing arrangements., If you're trying to learn about the ways that horses function as living, breathing organisms, scientific resources are your best bet. While even sources as general as Wikipedia can have useful horse information, sources put together by scientists and/or horse experts are generally more reputable.


A good place for beginners to start is the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), a free online biological resource. The EOL horse page contains the most important foundational information about horses, including the species' complete scientific classification.The National Geographic horse page offers a good amount information on the history of horse evolution and domestication.The Journal of Equine Veterinary Science is a professional-level resource that publishes articles on the latest in horse medicine. Unfortunately, only the abstracts of the articles are available for free., While the sources above should answer most questions about horses, they may not always be 100% exhaustive. If you're unable to find the horse information you're looking for with these sources, don't be afraid to do some digging on the search engine of your choice. There's much more free horse information on the internet than can be listed here, so start exploring!

Talk to a horse professional.,
Contact a breed association.,
Contact a local equestrian center.,
Contact a local tack shop.,
Consider interning or volunteering around horses.,
For serious scientific information, visit a university library.",How to Get Free Information About Horses2," Learning about horses doesn't just mean reading about them online. Ideally, your equine education should include some in-person learning as well. If you actually get to interact with horses, all the better. A smart first step is to get in touch with someone who works with horses. This can be a veterinarian, a rancher, a breeder, or even a mounted police officer — each will have plenty of experience with the animals and should be able to answer basic questions (or at least point you in the direction of the correct resources.)


Since the amount and number of horse professionals you'll have access to can vary greatly depending on where you live, it's a good idea to use the AQHA's trainer finder tool, which searches the association's database for names of horse professionals near you., Horses aren't monolithic — there are many different breeds; each of which is bred for its own purpose. If you are looking for information about a specific breed, try getting in touch with that breed's association. Many may even be willing to send you a packet of information that can include photos, posters, history, information guides, breed standards, membership info, and more. Major breed associations include:


The AQHA (mentioned above)Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association (TOBA)Racking Horse Breeders Association of America (RHBAA)American Saddlebred Horse Association (ASHA), Stables and equestrian centers are a good choice for answering questions about horses. Since these sorts of businesses usually allow paying customers to ride horses, they're probably more than accustomed to handling beginners' questions. While it's usually easiest to find equestrian centers in rural areas, even major urban centers often have some horse-centered businesses along their outskirts.


To find a stable or equestrian center near you, try using a business directory program like find.mapmuse.com or Yelp., Tack shops are places that sell horse-related supplies. Staff at the tack shop should be ready and willing to answer any sort of questions a newcomer might have. Local tack shops are also often the center of the horse community in their area, so many will have a notice board or a schedule of local events which can allow you to stay up-to-speed on the latest opportunities to be around horses.


Again, it's usually easiest to find tack shops with online business directories like Yelp. You might also try using your local white pages.

, Perhaps the single best way to learn about horses is to actually spend time around them. While paying for horse rides can be quite expensive, volunteering at a horse charity or equestrian society allows you to spend time around your favorite animals for free. If you're lucky, you might even be able to get an internship that can give you valuable connections and work experience — this will generally be easiest if you're a student or you've just graduated.


One organization that offers horse-related internships is the Equine Research Foundation (though these are open mainly to students.)There are many, many more at local stables, equestrian centers, vet's offices, and so on, so don't be afraid to reach out to businesses in your area about the possibility.

, If you're interested in studying horses in an academic setting, there are few places better than a university library. Most colleges' biology departments should have large collections of publications having to do with natural organisms, which can easily include information on horses. In addition, many university libraries allow students to access online databases of academic articles for research purposes.


Some universities are better than others when it comes to providing information about horses. In general, schools with a focus on biology and/or agriculture often have some of the best resources available. For instance, Texas A&M University has its own equine science department."

Choose the type of sugar beet pulp.,
Choose whether to buy molassed or unmolassed versions.,

Purchase the sugar beet.,
Soften the sugar beet.,
Let it sit.,
Feed the sugar beet to the horse.,

Introduce sugar beet slowly.,
Know how much sugar beet to offer.",How to Feed Sugar Beet to a Horse," Sugar beet for horses comes in two main forms, including shredded and pelleted. Both are dehydrated and most horse owners reconstitute them with water before feeding, but there is no nutritional difference between the types.


The shreds are not as dense as the pellets and so tend to soak up water a bit faster,but they also tend to be slightly more expensive.;
, Although sugar beet pulp is a byproduct of sugar beet manufacturing, it actually doesn't end up containing much sugar and can be a bit bitter. Some manufacturers add molasses to the pulp to make it tastier for horses and increase the carb load for horses needing extra sugar for energy.


Unmolassed sugar beet is ideal for horses or ponies who need a sugar- or starch-reduced diet, are prone to laminitis (swelling of the hoof),or already have enough sugar in their diet.Molassed versions of sugar beet provides horses extra energy, which can benefit work horses such as hunters, ranch work horses, or race horses, or horses recovering from starvation. It is also good for maintaining weight in winter.
If your horse has no health concerns and is a picky eater, the molassed version might be best since it tends to be more palatable and less dusty than the non-molassed., If you want to serve your horse large quantities of sugar beet, you will need to prepare it overnight by letting it soak in water. Since this can take a while, you may prefer to serve smaller quantities dry, mixed in with your horse's other feed or offered in hand.


If your horse needs sugar beet to replace all or most of his foraging food (such as hay), you will need to serve it moist.

, You can order pellet or shredded sugar beet pulp online, or at your local farm supply or horse feed retailer.


If you have a store nearby, it may be best to purchase there. The bags are generally sold in 25 pound or larger quantities so the shipping might be a bit steep for an online purchase.
Buy a smaller bag the first time you try it, and be sure it does not cause any digestive problems before you spend a lot on a bigger bag. Most horses tolerate sugar beet fine, but some do not.

, Put the appropriate amount of sugar beet into a container, and fill it with water about 5 centimeter (2.0 in) - 10 centimeter (3.9 in) above the sugar beet. This will soak into the sugar beet; think of it like preparing oatmeal. Hot water soaks in quickly and takes less time, but cold can be used if it's all you have (just give it more time to sit).


The first time you offer sugar beet, just one small scoop (about a cup) is plenty. You can add a bit more each time you feed the horse.

, Place the container out of reach of animals and leave it for at least 24 hours to fully absorb the water.


Put a cover over the top to keep out bugs and other pests.
Some brands of sugar beet pellet such as Speedi-Beet do not have to be left as long; these should only take 10 minutes to absorb the water, but check it is not dry before feeding.

, You can do this in one of two ways: by itself or mixed in with the rest of the horse's feed.


A picky horse may reject the sugar beet by itself, so you may want to try combining a small amount with its regular feed and then gradually increasing the amount of sugar beet.

, Horses who are underweight can really benefit from the added sugars in some sugar beet. Many people consider sugar beet an ideal food additive for horses who have been malnourished.Sugar beet might also be a good source of fiber for horses with poor teeth, since it is easier to chew than hay.Other horses who might benefit from sugar beet are those who have frequent digestive issues such as constipation or diarrhea, horses who are insulin-resistant and thus sensitive to sugar and starch, or a horse who is being conditioned and needs to gain weight., Changes in horse diet should always be introduced gradually to avoid digestive issues and to ensure that the horse tolerates the new food well. Gradual introduction also helps picky horses accept a new food.


One study associated the feeding of sugar beet with an increased risk for colic, a potentially fatal gastrointestinal condition in horses, but also found that changing a horse's diet in any way could also increase the risk. The best way to reduce the risk of colic is to introduce sugar beet or any other change in diet in gradual increments.
Always measure the dry sugar beet pulp before feeding it, and keep a record of how much you feed your horse. Start with a very small amount (a handful or two), and gradually work up the amount when you're sure it is not having any negative effects on your horse's digestion., The amount you should give your horse depends on why you are feeding the sugar beet in the first place. For instance, if you are supplementing the horse's diet to add extra fiber, you will need to feed less than if you are totally replacing grain or forage feed (such as hay).


A nourishing diet can have up to 55% beet pulp, but no more. Since horses need to eat between 1.5 and 3% of their body weight in dry matter,an 1100 pound horse can safely eat 12 pounds of dry beet pulp per day (properly reconstituted with water first, of course, which will make it even heavier)."

Find your horse's personal favorite treat.,
Do your research on treats.,
Do not feed your horse the following: Lawn, hedge or garden clippings, cabbage, including broccoli, cauliflower, etc., potatoes, tomatoes, acorns, chocolate (If you are competing can cause a positive drug test.),
Instead of hand-feeding, put the treats in with his feed.,
Do not feed more than three treats in one week.",How to Feed a Horse Treats," Every week, feed him a different treat and watch how he acts. Common favorite treats are cookies, carrots, and pitted cherries, but like people, every horse is different.;
, Here is a list of treats that horses enjoy eating: Pitted Dates, raisins, sugar cubes, hay cubes, apple pieces, carrot pieces, sunflower seeds (With or without shells), peppermints, naturally flavored cough drops (Believe it or not!)

,

, Hand-feeding encourages nipping and biting and, as we all know, nobody wants that.

, It is proven unhealthy, just like if you eat a bunch of Hershey bars in one day, your horse may get sick.

Identify if the horse is starving.,
Give the horse some water.,
Allow your horse a few hours to adjust to its surroundings before feeding it.,
Start feeding after the horse has begun drinking for a few hours.,
Feed the horse a quarter pound of grass hay three times on the next day.,
After three days give up it to half a pound three times a day.,
Do this for a few days and then go up to 1½ pounds of hay.,
Continue this for 4-5 days and then the hay may be upped to as much as three pounds per feeding, gradually over a period of 2-3 days.

It will have skin stretched tightly over its body.
It will also have a very bony, concave face.
Its neck will most likely be extremely thin. Its back will be bony and its shoulders should show clearly through the pelt.
The ribs should be easily noticeable (note that healthy horses as well as recently foaled mares will often times have their ribs slightly showing through their hides). Just behind their ribs around their gut, it should be stretched and concave. The skin stretching from belly to thigh or over the stifle, should be stretched.
The hips should be extremely noticeable and pull out from beneath the skin. They should point out around the croup of the horse.
The butt should be bony and concave. There are always some variations to starvation in horses of course as sometimes they do not appear to be.;
, If your horse has not had water in a while, give water to it slowly, about a 1/2 cup of water every 30 minutes until your horse is hydrated and doesn't drink immediately when you water it. Do this for at least 3 days after adoption to ensure the horses safety. Then you may fill up a water bucket, pan, or stall mate for your horse.

, Begin by giving it light foods such as flakes or grass hay. Grass pickings are also good to start with as they are light and lower in value.

, Then, give a simple handful of grass, of maybe grass hay. Give 2-4 handfuls of grass or grass hay every 30-40 minutes. It may seem excruciatingly slow, but small, persistent feedings are best. Do this for about five hours. This will ease food into the system and allow the horse to start its digestive process. Do this for just one day.

, In the morning and at nights seem to work best. If your horse is severely starved, you may want to feed this quarter pound by handfuls again. You may also want to only give it a quarter of a pound twice. Repeat again the next day.

, You may also began feeding your horse a carrot or an apple for a snack to ensure some extra energy from its diet.

, Add some alfalfa to the hay to give more nutrients and energy to the horse's diet—just a handful or so per feeding (once again thrice a day) to insure the horse's health.

,, This is to help out the horse by allowing it to eat freely as well as eat its hay. Three feedings each day must be continued.

, A short, few minute walk before feeding, or allowing free range for 30 minutes in a clean yard. This is to help if the horse is not doing OK with its diet. You may also give a couple handfuls of wheat to your horse a day to give it energy and fat gain. Only do this 4-5 days a week.

, Continue allowing your horse out for 30 minutes daily. If there is no grass available simply add an extra 1/2 pound of grass hay to your horses diet. Go for about 1.5 week.

, of alfalfa twice a day. Or, you can do 3 pounds of alfalfa and 2 pounds of grass hay for 3 times. Let the horse out for 45-60 minutes and continue walking and/or lunging your horse. 0.6 ounces of oats can be added to the overall daily feed.


If you have a pony, you may continue with the above diet if not continue on. Over the course of 2-3 weeks change your horse main diet from grass hay to alfalfa.
Switch it around slowly so your horse is eating 5-6 pounds of alfalfa twice a day and 2-3 pounds of grass hay once a day.
Encourage exercise and begin doing trotting exercises on the lunge. You may begin giving short, light rides to your horse for about 20-30 minutes and only twice a week. Also, allow your horse out to graze for an hour and a half.
Try to make these grazing sessions with other horses. If you have a stallion, he will now be able to cover a mare although it is not desired. This is for 2 weeks.

, Grazing should be somewhere between 2-2½ hours a day. You can ride twice a week for about 1 hour a day. 1-2½ ounces of oats may be give on days when you ride, and only once a day. Do this for a week or just over.

,


Now the riding sessions can go up to 2 to 2 1/2 hours a day and only twice a week. 1-2½ ounces of oats can be given before each ride. A mare may now be covered although it is not desired.
Minor training in dressage, reining, and/or trail riding may began.
Give carrots and/or apples before and after rides or training.
Do this for 3-4 weeks.
Graze for only 2-2½ hours.
Add one-half cup of molasses to the feed on riding days for energy, but only twice a week.

, 2-4 pounds of grass hay. Ride for anywhere from 1-4 hours a day and 2-3 times a week.


Begin cantering and more serious training. Ranch work can also begin although for only 1-4 hours and 2-3 times a week as with the riding (training counts as riding).
Grazing can be anywhere from 2-4 hours a day. A couple ounces of oats can be added to the daily feed on riding/training days. Mountain riding can begin. Do this for 2-3 weeks.

, Do this forever. 3-4 pounds of grass hay will be good once a day. Oats can be given (1-5 ounces a day) on working days. The horse should be fit enough for jumping and galloping.


Begin training for rodeos, cross-country, and racing. Grazing should go for about 1-5 hours a day and only 3-4 days a week. Riding can be done 2-4 days a week.
The horse may also begin entering competitions and will be ready for almost anything.
Rides can be 1-5 hours long. The horse should be almost fully back in shape.
Carriage work or hard farm work can also begin and be increased after 2-3 weeks.

Give treats in moderation.,
Don’t let treats encourage bad behavior.,
Use treats to reinforce positive behavior.,
Be consistent with your delivery and timing of treats.,
Feed your horse treats correctly.",How to Feed a Horse Carrots1," Both in terms of frequency and amount, always limit the amount of treats you feed your horse. There are several important reasons to keep portions of treats small, many of which have to do with horse digestion.Your horse’s digestive tract contains a balance of bacteria and microbes that are vital to healthy intestinal function.
This balance is actually quite fragile, and too much of even a healthy treat can upset a horse’s digestive track, leading to discomfort, colic, or other illnesses.
Feed your horse only one or two carrots at a time. Small portions of treats are vital. Aside from digestive issues, avoid messing with your horse’s diet, as this risks lowering protein absorption and diluting vitamin and mineral amounts.;
, If your horse starts to anticipate receiving treats, this will likely negatively affect their behavior. Even the well-intended use of treats for training risks reinforcing bad behavior. Accordingly, you should:Never feed another person’s horse a treat without permission.
Never feed a treat to a horse that is in a pen with other horses.
Don’t ever feed a horse a treat “just because”.
Learn and follow a protocol on how to give treats to positively reinforce good behavior only.

, The good news is that treats can be used to effectively encourage good behavior. However, you must balance the use of treats to influence behavior by ensuring your horse does not come to expect treats.Employ a diminishing reward system. Reduce the frequency and portion of treats as a good behavior becomes a conditioned response.
Instead of treats, slowly transfer to friendly stroking and positive verbal encouragement following a desired behavior.
Only use treats intermittently in training regimes. Not everything you teach your horse needs to incorporate treats.

, Training, especially training with treats, depends on your consistent delivery of reinforcement and the clarity of the message you’re sending to your horse.One way to articulate your pleasure with positive behavior is to establish a word or short phrase, such as “good horse”.
Always accompany this phrase with affectionate touching and a positive tone of voice.
Use this phrase as a bridge signal to let your horse know they have earned a treat.
Only give a treat within three seconds of a bridge signal, which should immediately follow a behavior you are trying to reinforce.
The sequence you employ when giving treats must always stay the same.

, While you can feed a horse by bucket, trough, or hand, there are risks involved in feeding a horse by hand. Horses fed by hand are more likely to get nippy with you and others. Of course, to properly use treats as a training tool, you must feed your horse treats by hand.


If you do feed a horse a treat by hand, it’s important to do so correctly. Place a piece of carrot in the palm of your hand, with the fingers lying as flat as you can get them.
Hold your hand out in front of you, where the horse can easily see it.
As the horse reaches for the treat, gently and slowly raise your hand towards the horse’s mouth. Don’t withdraw your hand at the last second, as this may cause the horse to lunge for the treat and potentially chomp your hand.Do not carry treats in your pocket. Some horses will nip at your clothes if they know there are treats in them. This can end badly for all parties.

Obtain a mint.,
Select a horse.,
Get the horse’s attention.",How to Feed a Horse a Mint1," Both wrapped and unwrapped mints are available at most grocery stores. Horses enjoy both types, and will not mind either. Try to get a mint that is sugar-free. If you cannot find a sugar-free mint, it’s probably okay. However, horses with equine metabolic syndrome, Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy, or Cushing’s Disease cannot eat sugary mints.If your mints are wrapped, be sure to remove the wrapper before feeding them to a horse. Over time, your horse will learn to recognize the sound of the wrapper and will get excited about its treat.;
, Feed mints to gentle horses. A horse that tends to be calm and gentle is much easier to feed by hand than a high-strung horse that tends to bite or that may be pushy to try to get the mint. Larger horses might be more intimidating for you at first, so you might also want to start out by feeding a smaller horse.


To get a feel for which horse is most relaxed, pet it gently on the forehead or nose when it is in its stall. If it doesn’t shy away, it is an especially docile horse and would be a good candidate to receive a mint.
Some breeds are naturally calmer than others.Clydesdales, for instance, are known for their gentle demeanor. American Quarter Horses are also typically quite calm.
Horses with a habit of chewing on human clothing or grooming brushes, or horses with a history of biting, will probably not be gentle when being fed by hand.Do not hand-feed a horse with these habits.

, If the horse you intend to feed a mint to is in an open pasture, you'll need to get it to approach you. You could use a verbal signal like “Mint!” or you could just make clicking or kissing sounds to get the horse’s attention.Do not bang pots and pans together or yell in an aggressive way at the horse to get its attention. This will only scare the horse and cause it stress.


Most horses will come to you easily if you talk gently to them and make kissing noises.

Provide your horse with plenty of fresh, clean water.,
Provide your horse with plenty of structural carbohydrates.,
Provide your horse with nonstructural carbohydrates in moderation.,
Supplement your horse’s diet with feed to provide protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals.,
Supplement as needed.,
Give treats in moderation.,
Weigh your horse by using a weight tape or weight bridge (equine scales).,
Calculate the total daily requirements (forage and concentrate).,
Determine what type of weight gain you want for your horse.,
Control the energy level in forage by feeding different types or a mix of types.,
Choose a type of energy to suit your horse.,
Check it with a professional if you are unsure about how much to feed your horse.,
Adjust your horse’s food intake as needed.,
Schedule feedings for an hour before or after you have ridden your horse.,
Make gradual changes to your horse’s diet.",How to Feed a Horse," Horses require between 5-15 gallons of water per day. If possible, make sure that your horse has access to water at all times. Otherwise, make sure that you water your horse at least twice per day and allow several minutes for your horse to drink.Make sure that the water in your horse’s trough is clean and not frozen. Keep the trough clean as well by hosing it out every day.;
, Structural carbohydrates, like hay and grass, are essential to a horse’s diet.Horses eat large quantities of hay and grass as their main source of food. In fact, horses should eat about 15-20 pounds or 1-2% of their body weight in hay every day, so make sure that your horse always has plenty of hay to chew on.Make sure that the hay you feed your horse is free of mold and dust., Nonstructural carbohydrates, like oats, corn, and barley, are also essential to a horse’s nutrition. Provide small amounts of grain to your horse throughout the day. Every day, horses can also have ½ pound of grain per 100 pounds of body weight. Feed grain to your horse in two or three evenly spaced feedings during the day.Make sure to measure the portions that you feed your horse to make sure that you are giving her the correct amount.If the weather is hot, feed grain to your horse during the cooler hours of the day, such as early in the morning and later in the evening.

, Although your horse will get most of its calories from hay and grass, you should feed your horse some fortified feed each day to help meet any nutritional gaps. Protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals are important parts of your horse’s nutrition, but they are not required in large amounts., If you think your horse is not getting all of the necessary vitamins and minerals from feed, then you can supplement with special vitamins for horses. Just be careful not to overload your horse with too many vitamins. An excess of vitamins can cause problems just like a deficiency of vitamins can., Giving treats to your horse when you want to reward her is a great way to bond with your horse as well. Just make sure that you do not overdo it with treats or your horse may learn to expect them or may even try to root around in your clothes for treats.Fresh apples, carrots, green beans, watermelon rinds, and celery make great treats for your horse., A weight bridge is far more accurate and should be used instead of a tape if available. Condition scoring is the best form of recording weight changes. Weigh your horse every 2 weeks and plot the changes on a graph.

, The requirement is between 1.5 to 3% of its body weight, averaging at 2.5%. Use the following equation to determine how much you should feed your horse each day: BodyWeight/100x2.5=Total Daily Ration

, Do you want to keep your horse at the level it is already at (maintenance diet)? Do you want to reduce the horse’s weight because of health issues (reduction diet)? Or, do you want to increase your horse’s body weight due to a past illness or because your horse is underweight?


The best strategy to use when developing a feeding plan for your horse is to feed based on the desired weight, rather than the current weight. e.g. A horse is underweight and weighs 300kg. If the horse’s ideal weight is 400kg, don't feed 2.5% of 300kg. Feed 2.5% of 400kg.
Use the same strategy for an overweight horse. Feed based on the desired weight, and not current, meaning you will actually be feeding less that the overweight amount, meaning, a reduction of waistline for your horse.

, Different forage have different amounts of DE (digestible energy) this depends on the type of forage (grass, haylage, hay, oat straw) and the type of grass (rye, timothy, cocksfoot or orchard grass). For grazing the time of year also affect the DE. Spring grass has a high level while winter grazing is very poor. For preserved grass the “cut” affects the DE. Early cut grass is higher in DE than late cut grass. Oat Straw is very low in DE. The best way to find out the nutritious in your forage is to have it analyzed.

, Some horses are prone to heating up (becoming over excited and spooky). Feeding these horses slow-release energy (fiber and oil) will help, this is the safest form of energy and causes the least amount of health problems. Other horses are lazy and lack “sparkle”. Feeding fast-release energy (starch found in cereals/grains like oats and barley) can help. Starch has been connected with a number of health problems and must be restricted for some horses.

, If you are not sure how much you should be feeding your horse, talk to your horse’s veterinarian. Some feed manufacturers also have help lines that you can use to get feeding advice for your horse.

, Your horse’s nutritional needs will vary according to the amount of fresh grass she has consumed while out to pasture and the level of activity she has had. Evaluate your horse’s needs every day to determine whether to subtract or add from her regular feeding amounts.If your horse has been out to pasture all day and has been eating lots of grass, she will not require as much hay.
If your horse has had a hard workday with lots of riding, then you will need to provide more food to help replenish the extra calories she burned.

, Don’t feed your horse right before or right after she has finished doing something strenuous because blood flow will be diverted away from her organs and that can interfere with digestion. Plan feedings around your horse’s scheduled activity.If your horse will be doing something extra strenuous, schedule her feeding for three hours before the activity.

, If you need to change your horse’s feed, do not just switch to the new feed. Start by replacing 25% of the old feed with the new feed. In two days, replace 50% of the old feed with the new feed. Two days after that, replace 75% of the old feed with the new feed. Then two days after that you will be able to give your horse 100% new feed.


In addition to making food changes gradually, you should also feed your horse at about the same time every day. Horses perform better when they have a regular feeding schedule.
Making drastic changes to your horse’s feed or feeding schedule can lead to equine colic and founder. Equine colic is a condition that causes severe abdominal pain and may even require surgery.Founder is a condition that causes poor circulation and can even lead to the separation of the hoof from the foot. Founder is often fatal.

Give your horse only healthy treats.,
Break carrots and other treats into small pieces.,
Make homemade horse treats!,
Balance treats with a horse’s regular diet.,
Don’t feed your horse unsafe snacks.",How to Feed a Horse Carrots2," Aside from carrots, other classics include apple slices and bananas. There are actually lots of fruits and vegetables that are safe for horses.


Other fruits horses love include: Apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, dates, figs, grapes (and raisins), grapefruit, mangoes, oranges, peaches, pears, pineapple, plums, strawberries, tangerines, and watermelon.Whenever you feed a horse anything that has a pit, remove the pit first.
Other safe snacks include: Beets, celery, corn, horseradish, lettuce, pumpkin, rutabaga, squash, sweet potatoes, and turnips.

, Some horses will get especially excited by treats and try to gulp them down. They may even swallow with such voracity that they wind up choking. Break up carrots with your hands or cut them into small pieces.

, Include carrots and oatmeal in a recipe for cookies designed specifically for horses. Start by mixing 1 cup uncooked oatmeal, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup shredded carrots.
Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 tablespoons corn oil, a ¼ cup water, and a ¼ cup molasses.
Roll dough into small balls and place them on a greased cookie sheet.
Bake horse cookies at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until golden brown.

, A horse’s diet should regularly consist of plenty of roughage, as well as grain. Feed your horse a consistent diet with disciplined regularity.Ensure a horse eats one to two percent of their body weight in roughage every day. A horse’s digestive system is designed to eat grassy stalks, such as hay. This should make up the majority of your horse’s diet.
Allow your horse to replicate the eating pattern associated with foraging by simply making roughage available all day.
Provide grain in small amounts, twice a day. Not only are smaller meals more natural, they allow for better digestion.
Feed according to size, lifestyle, and season. If your horse is at pasture all day, you don’t need to provide hay. Winter weather may prevent the availability of grass, however, necessitating the provision of hay. (In the spring and summer, there will likely be plenty of grass naturally available to your horse if they have sufficient pasture.)
Make any dietary changes slowly and intermittently. Do not make any sudden or drastic changes to your horse’s diet. If you’re changing a type of feed, only replace ¼ of a batch with the new food every other day until the new food has fully replaced the old.

, Even sugar cubes, which are frequently used as snacks, are pretty unhealthy for horses (though they’re not dangerous, they’re simply a bit gratuitous in the sugar department). More importantly, there are certain things you be sure never to feed your horse. Don’t allow your horse to eat lawn clippings. There may be poisonous plants or pieces of yard debris in clippings that might cause your horse to choke. Certain lawn clippings can also cause dramatic changes to your horse’s digestive tract, causing illness or discomfort.
Be careful about cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. These plants can all cause bloating, gas, and discomfort if your horse eats a lot of them.
Avoid potatoes and tomatoes. While some claim these are fine, it’s best to avoid them as they’re members of the nightshade family of plants, some of which are poisonous to horses. Accordingly, also avoid feeding your horse any type of pepper.
Do not feed your horse chocolate. While there’s not immediate danger, chocolate can cause positive results on drug tests (if your horse competes).
Avoid bready items. Bread products, especially fresh bread and donuts can turn into a clump of dough in the digestive tract and block your horse’s bowels. Nobody wants that.
Skip the sweet feed. Even some foods meant for horses can risk an unbalanced diet. While meant to be fed as treats, there are simply healthier options.
Other specific foods that are unsafe for your horse include avocado, onions, persimmons, and rhubarb."

Place the mint in front of the horse.,
Feed the horse by hand.,
Incorporate mints into other foods.Sprinkling crushed mint on apple slices, for instance, will excite your horse’s taste buds.,
Be generous with your horse.",How to Feed a Horse a Mint2," The best place to put the mint is on a flat surface like a table or the ledge of a stall door that the horse can easily access. You could also toss the mint toward the horse if it is in a clean pasture. Finally, you could place the mint in a feeding pan.Offer the pan to the horse by either placing the pan on the ground to the side of the horse or by holding the pan’s handle and bringing the mint up to within about five inches of the horse’s nose.


Since horses cannot see straight ahead, hold items that you want the horse to see off to one side of the horse's head or the other.

, If you want to have a more intimate mint-feeding experience with a horse, stand next to the horse’s shoulder and flatten your hand. Make sure all your fingers are touching each other and your thumb is against the side of your hand. Place the mint in the center of your palm. When the horse’s head is turned just slightly off-center toward the side opposite you, bring the hand holding the mint under the horse’s neck to the front of its nose. Keep your hand splayed and straight about five inches from the horse’s nose.


You will feel the horse's soft, fuzzy lips lapping up the mint into its mouth.
Don't panic when you feel the horse's mouth touch your hand. Be confident that the horse won't bite you. If you make a sudden movement, such as pulling away, you could spook the horse.
Wait until the horse lifts its head from your hand before you pull your hand back.
If your horse becomes pushy or anxious (starts to gallop, pace, whinny, or rear back on its hind legs) when you’re feeding it a mint, walk away and do not give it the mint.Don't reward pushy or aggressive behavior with treats. Try to feed it a mint again later if the horse is calm.
Make sure an experienced handler is either holding the horse with a lead rope when feeding by hand, or close by when you’re in the stall with the horse.

, Dropping a handful of peppermints into a jug of water for eight to ten hours can give the water a tasty, refreshing flavor that your horse will love. This is an especially useful method if you have a horse that doesn’t drink as much as he or she should.


Alternately, commercially available mint-flavored horse snacks provide you with the chance to give your horse a special treat.

, Horses cannot easily overdose on mints, so don’t worry about giving them too many.As long as you limit mints to once or twice each day, your horse will be fine.Don’t let mints replace a meal. Horses need to be fed plenty of hay and graze in the pasture for a healthy diet.

"
Obtain fresh mint leaves.,
Feed mint to cover other flavors.If your horse needs to take a bitter medicine, for instance, you could wrap the pills in mint leaves and feed them to your horse.,
Use mint to help wean young horses.,
Create a mint infusion.Place five or six mint leaves in a spray bottle.",How to Feed a Horse a Mint3," Mint has anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties that will keep your horse healthy. The best way you can provide a steady supply of mint for your horse is to grow your own small herb garden.Plant mint seeds in a soil with pH of six or seven. Seeds should be placed 18 to 24 inches apart and planted in spring. Keep the soil moist and water as needed.


If you grow mint in a small garden that your horse can access, you won’t even have to feed it to your horse, and it can eat as much as it wants.

, You could also feed your horse mint along with another herb in order to make the other herb more palatable.


For example, if your horse needs to eat milk thistle but does not like the taste, you could feed it five or six leaves of mint along with the milk thistle. The next day, feed four or five leaves of mint along with the milk thistle. Gradually reduce the amount of mint leaves you give the horse and it will then be able to eat the milk thistle without the added mint.

, If you want to wean a horse off of its mother’s milk, feed the mare mint for about week. This will end milk production and help the weaning process along., Fill the bottle with water and let it sit overnight. Mint leaves have anti-itch and cooling properties. Spray the mint infusion on the horse’s legs, flank, and back to cool it down and keep bugs at bay during the hot summer months.


You could use dried or fresh mint for this infusion.

Know the symptoms of colic.,
Check the horse's temperature.,

De-worm on a regular basis.",How to Cure Colic in Horses and Ponies," The symptoms of colic can vary based on how severe the colic is. Though the pain is in the stomach, your horse may show signs that don't automatically point to the stomach.Mild colic may exhibit in your horse as restlessness, such as pawing at the ground. Your horse also may keep curling his lips or keep looking around to his backside.In a moderate case, your horse may want to lay down more often. He may also pee more often.With severe cases, your horse may start rolling on the ground with violent motions. You may also see in an increase in respiration and sweat.Symptoms of gas colic in particular are loud noises in the abdominal area and gut pain that comes and goes.Impacted colic may prevent the horse from defecating, and he may not want to eat. He will also have pain in the abdomen.Horses should defecate at least 6 times in a 24-hour period, so you should be on the lookout if you suspect your horse has colic.;
, A horse's temperature should be between about 99 degrees and 101 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use a rectal thermometer designed for horses to check your horse's temperature. If it's elevated, that's another indication your horse could be colicky., Only try to treat the horse yourself if he is exhibiting mild symptoms of colic. If the horse is already in the moderate or severe stage, move on to calling the vet. The first step to treating your horse yourself is to get him moving.Walk your horse around for about 30 minutes.Walking can help your horse if the colic is caused by gas. It may also provide a distraction from the pain he's experiencing. However, walking him too long can make him tired if he's already feeling bad., If your horse is continuously looking at his side and even trying to bite that area, it's time to call the vet.Other symptoms that tell you it's time to call the vet are if your horse is laying down too much, not eating, or not defecating.Also call the vet if your horse's pulse is over 50 beats a minute., If the colic is caused by an impacted colon, adding more food to his intestine will not help the situation.

, When your vet arrives, he will perform a full examination, though he won't likely be able to pinpoint the exact cause. He will, however, be able to tell you how severe the problem is and what the best course of treatment is.Be prepared to answer questions about your routine, worming process, and feed type.
Your veterinarian may do a rectal examination or a belly tap. A belly tap is a process where the horse is sedated and a tube is passed through his nose into his stomach.The belly tap can be helpful in two ways. It can determine if there's fluid in the stomach (which needs to be drained), and it's a way to give the horse mineral oil, which can relieve an impaction by lubricating it. This process can also be way to hydrate the horse.Rectal exams allow the vet to check for problems in the intestine, such as feeling for an impaction., Depending on the determined cause, the vet may treat your horse with pain relieving drugs, such as analgesics like banamine. Most horses need some type of painkiller.Also, your vet may administer laxatives; the mineral oil in the previous step is an example of an laxative he may use to treat an impaction., If your horse is severely dehydrated, your vet may need to provide him with IV fluids to help with the re-hydration process. You may need to change the bag at some point, so ask your vet for a demonstration if you aren't sure how to do it., In the case of an impaction, your horse needs to be off food until the impaction is cleared. Ask your vet how long you should wait after he defecates before you can feed him or if you need to look for a particular sign to return him to feed., Once the symptoms ease, you can start the horse back to work. However, don't put him on a full day's work at first. Slowly ease him back into his work schedule as he continues to recover., Often, colic can be resolved by treatment from the veterinarian at your stable. However, if your horse has a problem such as twisted intestines, he will likely need to go to the hospital and have surgery performed.Just because your veterinarian refers you to a hospital does not automatically mean your horse will have surgery. The hospital will first check to see how treatment is working to determine whether he needs surgery. If he doesn't, the hospital can provide more intensive care for severe cases.In some cases, the horse will need to be euthanized because the colic is so bad.However, this outcome is less likely with current medical practices., Check him at two-hour intervals following initial treatment to ensure symptoms ease up. If they don't ease, call your veterinarian again.

, Colic can come in a number of forms. From impaction to gas and other diseases, the causes of your horse's colic can vary widely.Impaction is when food is backed in the horse's gut somewhere. It hurts the horse because the intestines are trying to get the food to move, but it won't dislodge.Another type of colic is caused by gas. Horses do have gas as a normal part of everyday life, but sometimes extreme gas causes discomfort because it expands the gut.Still another type of colic is caused by what's known as ""intestinal accidents,"" meaning injuries to abdominal organs, such as when the intestines have a twist in them or the colon moves out of place.Stomach and intestine diseases can also cause colic. For instance, colitis and ulcers can cause symptoms of colic.""False colic"" is when the horse exhibits symptoms of colic, but the cause is something outside of the abdomen, such as laminitis or bladder stones., One cause of impaction can be dehydration. Horses need constant water; even being without water for an hour or so can cause problems. Making sure it is fresh is important, because horses may ignore water that isn't as fresh as they'd like it to be., Dental health is important for maintaining healthy horses.Good teeth encourage your horse to chew properly, which makes an impaction less likely., Horses need roughage to make sure food moves through their system as it should. Therefore, ensure your horse has fresh hay available or is allowed to graze in a pasture every day., If you give your horse food on the ground, your horse may accidentally eat other things that are not food. If your horse eats enough of these other particles, it can block his bowels. For instance, your horse may eat too much sand with the hay, causing problems., Regular exercise keeps your horse in a routine and can also move the bowels along. Make sure to encourage exercise at least once a day., You provide some de-wormers daily, while others require you to give them less often; your vet can help you determine the best kind for your horses. This process helps control parasites, and an excess of parasites can sometimes lead to colic in horses.Ask your veterinarian about de-worming foals, as they may require special treatment."

Determine your horse's weight.,
Measure the right amount.,
Mix it into your horse’s feed.,
Mix the supplement with a treat.,
Purchase a mineral block.",How to Feed a Horse Magnesium1," In order to provide your horse with the correct amount of magnesium, you will need to know how much your horse weighs. Depending on its age and breed, your horse could weigh anywhere from 840 to 1210 lb. (380 to 550 kilograms). Your veterinarian should have a scale to weigh your horse on.;
, To begin with, try giving your horse 10 grams (1/3 ounce) of magnesium supplement a day. This should be safe regardless of the type of supplement used. If you feel that more is needed, consult with a veterinarian before increasing the dosage.If you increase the dose, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions. This usually involves calculating a dosage based upon your horse’s weight and diet, which can be complicated. Consult with your veterinarian before increasing the dosage.If you decide to dose the horse yourself, understand that increasing the dosage may result in diarrhea and dehydration. This could make your horse very ill and possibly kill it.

, Once you have determined the correct amount of supplement to add, mix it into your horse’s feed. If it is grain, stir the supplement into the mix. You may also sprinkle it on their hay. However, they will ingest much less of the magnesium this way.These supplements all come in powder form and generally need to mixed with your horses feed or another food.
Avoid mixing magnesium supplements with oils. The oil may bond the magnesium and make it more difficult for the horse to absorb., If you are giving your horse a bitter magnesium supplement, like magnesium oxide, you may want to consider mixing it with molasses or applesauce to mask the bad flavor. If you do not mix it with something, your horse will not eat the supplement.

, If you do not want to mix the magnesium with your horse’s feed, you can also get a mineral block. These are typically designed for cattle, which require less trace minerals than a horse, but they can provide some help."
"
Consider Epsom salts.,
Use magnesium oxide.,
Evaluate magnesium aspartate.",How to Feed a Horse Magnesium2," Magnesium sulfate, or Epsom salts, is a cheap source of magnesium that you can feed your horse. You can find large quantities of it at most farm supply stores. However, because the horse will only absorb a small amount of magnesium from Epsom salts, you will need to feed them more of it. In turn, this increases the risk of your horse developing diarrhea and dehydration.Talk with your veterinarian before administering any supplements.

, This mineral will give you the most bang-for-your-buck when it comes to magnesium supplements. Unlike Epsom salts that deliver a small amount, magnesium oxide has a much higher magnesium concentration and, therefore, provides your horse with more of the mineral. This means that a little of the compound can go a long ways. However, it is very bitter, so you will likely have to mask the flavor.Try mixing magnesium oxide with salt for the best results.Consider mixing the magnesium oxide with applesauce or molasses to hide the bitter taste.

, This magnesium supplement is twenty percent magnesium and highly water-soluble. This means that you do not need a lot, and what you use will be quickly absorbed through the lining of your horse’s intestines. This is a higher end horse supplement, so you might want to evaluate whether it is worth using over cheaper options."
"
Research your soil’s mineral makeup.,
Evaluate magnesium levels in new grass or feed.,
Consider what time of year it is.,
Observe if your horse seems nervous or skittish.",How to Feed a Horse Magnesium3," If you soil is low in magnesium, the grass that grows in it will be low in mineral as well. Considering that your horse receives the majority of its daily magnesium needs through a normal forage diet, it is important to understand if your soil is helping or hindering those needs.You can hire a soil testing service or test it yourself using a commercial test kit.
The easiest way to avoid magnesium deficiency in your horse is to properly maintain your pastures.

, Depending on the soil that they grow in, grasses can be magnesium deficient. The same is true of horse feed. In turn, this can cause your horse to develop a magnesium deficiency. Make sure that the grass and feed that your horse is eating are high in magnesium and other important minerals.Your retailer or distributor should provide information on the mineral make up of their feed.

, Because magnesium is water-soluble, it is easily leached from the ground during rainy seasons. If it has recently rained a lot, the grass will likely not have enough magnesium in it, leading to your horse developing a deficiency. You can increase the magnesium in the soil by sprinkling dolomite or Epsom salts in the field or pasture where your horse feeds., Many consider skittishness a symptom of magnesium deficiency in horses. In fact, magnesium is often recommended as a supplement to help horses relax. If your horse seems more timid than usual, they may be suffering from a magnesium deficiency.There is little scientific evidence to support this claim. If your horse is acting anxious, consult your veterinarian before giving it any supplements.

Be aware that delaying castration may cause behavioral issues.,
Consider the health risks involved in waiting to castrate.,
Remember that castration must be performed by a veterinarian.",How to Castrate a Horse," Your vet will need to assess your horse before the procedure and talk to you about the options for castration surgery. Some horses will be able to be castrated under sedation while at home in his stall, while others will need to be castrated under full anesthesia in a clinical setting.If the horse is healthy with two scrotal testicles, then the veterinarian may opt to to sedate the horse and operate using local anesthesia. This may be done in the field or at the clinic.
If the horse has a problem, then the operation must be done under full anesthesia and in a clinical setting. For example, if the horse has an undescended testicle, then the surgeon may need to perform abdominal surgery to find the missing testicle.
The veterinarian will also need to decide if it will be better to perform the surgery with horse standing up or lying down. A horse must be at least 14.2 hand high to qualify for a standing surgery.;
, The veterinarian will administer a cocktail of sedative drugs intravenously and then wait until the drugs have taken full effect. This should take about 20 minutes.

, Next, the veterinarian will clean the scrotal area and belly with lots of water and a surgical scrub.This step is necessary to remove as much debris and bacteria as possible from the horse’s body and help prevent an infection.

, Wearing sterile gloves, the surgeon will inject a local anesthetic into each testicle. The typical amount is 15 - 20 ml of mepivacaine. Then, the needle will be taken out slowly through the tissue while still injecting the local anesthetic. The anesthetic will numb the testicles and surrounding structures. It should take about five minutes to take full effect.

, Once the testicles are numb the surgeon makes an incision with a sterile scalpel blade through the skin of the scrotum.The incision will need to be just large enough for the testicles to fit through.

, The surgeons then applies pressure between the testicle and body in order to pop out the testicle. After the testicle is partway out of the scrotum, the surgeon will use his fingers to pull the testicle out the rest of the way.


The surgeon then has the choice whether to apply emasculators. The emasculator is an instrument that crushes and severs the spermatic cord.If the surgeon applies emasculators, then they will either apply them across the whole structure or make an incision through the tough fibrous tunic that covers the testicle.

, The veterinarian will leave the emasculator in place for one minute for young colts and at least two minutes for mature stallions. Leaving the emasculator in place for this amount of time will crush and seal the blood vessels. Next, the veterinarian will cut the cords that are on the side of the emasculator that is furthest away from the body. After the cords have been cut, the device will be slowly released., Last of all the veterinarian will inspect the stump of blood vessels for hemorrhage and apply ligatures to any bleeding vessels if necessary. If the surgeon finds that there is no hemorrhage, then the stump is will be released and allowed to retract back into the scrotum., After the first testicle has been removed, this procedure will need to be repeated on the other side for the other testicle.

, The incision are often not sutured but left open to heal by secondary intention. This allows any seepage of fluid to drain away under gravity, rather than building up beneath the skin and causing swelling. However, this is at the surgeon's discretion.


For mature stallions, the surgeon may close each layer of tissue with sutures. This can help to reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding in an active animal or to allow a rapid return to work., Following castration, it is important for your horse to rest in his stall for about 24 hours. Try to keep his area as quiet as possible and check on the horse now and then., After your horse has had 24 hours of rest, then he should get some light exercise. Lead him around on a walk if he does not seem to want to walk on his own. This will help to encourage proper healing and drainage of fluid from the horse’s scrotum., Check your horse’s scrotal area to make sure that is clean and does not look infected. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions for how to care for the surgical wound as well. You may be advised to keep the area clean with cold water hosing.To clean your horse's scrotal area, use a hose set on a low stream to remove any debris (hay, dirt, etc.) from the horse's scrotal region. Allow the water to run over the scrotal region until it looks clean.
Watch for signs of infection. Check your horse's scrotal region a couple times per day until the wound has healed. When you check, look for any signs of infection such as redness, swelling, and/or pus.

, Light exercise is advised for 7 - 10 days after surgery. After this time has passed, your horse can return to normal work. Make sure that you check with your veterinarian to be sure., The majority of male horses are castrated as yearlings, or in the first year of life. This prevents the development of unwanted aggressive behavior and makes the animal easier to manage.Horses that are castrated in the first year of life tend to be taller when they are fully grown because testosterone is what stops their growth.
Another advantage of castration at a young age is that the testicles are smaller and the blood supply to them is not as heavy as in a mature animal. This means that there is a lower risk of complications such as heavy bleeding after surgery., By delaying castration until two years of age, the horse may have a heavier more masculine appearance, which some people may prefer. But by delaying castration, there is also a risk that the horse will become aggressive or difficult to handle. These behavioral issues may even become established and continue after a horse has been castrated.


An uncastrated horse may also cause trouble by challenging other male horses or pestering the mares.

, The risk of health complications rises with the age of the horse due to the larger blood vessels. For horses over three years of age, many veterinarians will advise full anesthesia under clinical conditions. This may be necessary so that the veterinarian will be equipped to deal with any unforeseen surgical complications., Do not attempt to castrate a horse on your own. Castration is a veterinary surgical procedure that must be performed by a qualified veterinarian. A lay person (one who is not a veterinarian) may face legal charges for castrating a horse.


In addition to legal charges, a lay person could cause unnecessary pain and suffering to the horse.
A lay person will also not be equipped to deal with any postoperative complications that may arise.

Pay attention to itchiness.,
Look for buildup.,
Don’t wash your mare’s genitals and udders too often.,
Gather your supplies.,
Find a place with no distractions.,
Acclimate your mare to your presence.,
Wash gently on and around the udders.,
Rinse carefully.,
Repeat the same washing procedure around her genitals.,
Remove the “beans.” Using your hands, very gently turn the lower part of her labia inside-out.,
Finish up.",How to Clean a Mare's Female Parts," Mares have sebaceous glands that secrete oil on and around their udders. This oil will begin to mix with sweat and dirt over time and start to itch. If your mare seems to be trying to scratch or rub her udders a lot, she may appreciate a good cleaning!One sign that she’s feeling itchy is that she’s doing a lot of tail rubbing -- rubbing her tail on fences or posts frequently.;
, Check to see if there is a brownish black buildup around her udders or vulva. It will look a lot like dirt. A visible buildup means that it’s time to clean your mare’s udders and genitals.

, It’s perfectly normal for all skin surfaces on horses (like humans) to have bacteria that help maintain the health of the skin by warding off harmful microbes. Cleaning your horse too often will remove this good bacteria and cause dry skin that may chap and crack or even become infected. If you suspect that your mare has developed an infection from overly dry skin, call a vet immediately. She may need an antibiotic.
Some vets recommend that you begin by cleaning your mare’s udders and private parts twice a year and then decide from there (through careful observation) whether you need to do this more or less often.

, You’ll need a gentle cleanser (like Ivory or Dawn dishwashing liquid) in a bucket of warm water. You may also want to wear thin, disposable gloves. You’ll need at least two things to wash with (one for the udders and another for the genitals). You can use either a cotton cloth or some very soft paper towels. Get a soft towel or some flannel to dry her with as well. A sponge is also an option for washing with, but you should dispose of it after a few uses, because bacteria will accumulate on it. Label it carefully so that you don’t accidentally use it for any other purpose!
Some people recommend that you also wear a hard hat and boots with sturdy (preferably steel toe-capped) boots., Most vets recommend that you do this on a wash rack so that you have warm water readily available and so that your mare doesn’t get distracted by other horses or people.You can either tie her to the wash rack or have an assistant hold her. If you choose to use a helper, pick someone your horse is already familiar and comfortable with. This is not the right time to introduce her to someone new.
If she’s a bit skittish, you may want to save this procedure for a time when she’s tired.

, It’s very dangerous to dive right in and handle your mare’s udders without warning her. If you startle her, she may kick you, particularly if she is not used to this kind of cleaning.A good way to acclimate her to your presence is to place your hand on the mare’s belly. Make sure she feels comfortable with you in this position. Give her a few minutes to acclimate to your hand on her before diving in with the cloth. It’s also a good idea to have someone hold her for you while you do this.
Stay to the side of her. Don’t stand behind her, or you are more likely to put yourself in the kick zone. Some people like to let their mare smell the sponge or cloth before they wash her with it. This may help your horse acclimate to the cleaning and understand what’s happening next time.

, You will need to lift and separate the folds. Mares tend to get a dry buildup around their udders, which you should gently remove. Be sure the water stays relatively warm, and wash very gently without scratching at the buildup. It’s a good idea to keep your hand on her back or belly to feel for signs that she’s tensing up and getting ready to kick you.
Don’t scratch or pick at anything that doesn’t come off. You could startle or hurt her. Instead, soak the area with water, and come back to it later.
You may find that it’s easier to clean the udders of mares who have not foaled. If your mare has given birth, she will likely have larger udders and nipples, and dirt will accumulate around them more often. She may need a more frequent washing than a mare who has not foaled.This is also a good time to check for any abnormal swelling, wounds, or bleeding on her udders. Call your vet if you feel anything unusual.

, You may want to use a completely separate cloth or sponge for extra careful rinsing. You may also want to repeat the washing procedure again if you see any buildup left behind. Some horses may tolerate a rinse with a garden hose, but try this very carefully, because the hose water may be too cool or too forceful and startle her or cause discomfort.

, Use a fresh, clean sponge so that you don’t transfer bacteria from one part of her body to another. If the water got very dirty, you may also want to get fresh warm water and add more soap. Don’t forget to rinse carefully. Never use any soap internally on your mare. You don’t need to wash inside of her vagina at all. The vagina is “self-cleaning,” and you could give her an infection by introducing chemicals. Stick with external genitalia only - wash carefully around both sides of her labia.
Only use gentle, non irritating soaps like Ivory or Dawn dishwashing liquid. If it’s irritating to your hands, it’s probably irritating to her her body as well!
Even if she will tolerate the hose on her udders, your mare may not allow you to use it on her genitals.
Check for unusual swelling, wounds, or bleeding. Particularly if she has just given birth, check for a “tipped vulva,” Her vulva should sit directly below her anus. If her vulva is jutting out below her anus, she could get an infection because feces will tend to collect on her labia. Call your vet if you notice anything out of the ordinary., Remove any small, waxy “beans” that have built up. (Be very careful during this part, because this is the time when she is most likely to kick.), Dry her gently. Use a soft towel or flannel. Be sure to dry inside any folds that you washed so that moisture doesn’t build up. Praise her or reward her with treats as you dry her.

Decide on why you need spurs.,
Choose the correct style of spur for your style of riding.,
Select the right size..,
Choose the right spur for you.,
Get the perfect fit.,
Select a shank.,
Select a shank size Many organisations have regulations on shank sizes.,
Choose the right strap.",How to Choose the Correct Type of Spur for Horse Riding," Many riders wish to get a set of spurs just for the sake of having them. Spurs should only be used on a trained horse, which has learned leg commands. Many younger riders invest in a set of spurs, (Dummy Spurs), as their legs do not reach the horses side, or their leg muscles are not yet strong enough to apply force. Spurs do hurt and/or irritate the horse. The use of spurs might look and sound cool and exciting but they poke the horse and may eventually cause them to use bucking as a habit even if you just use your legs without spurs.;
, Many styles of riding, such as Dressage and Western, incorporate the Spur as part of the compulsory Dress Code, meaning that you are not demanded to wear or use them. For English, the spur is generally 'slim line' and is close contact, allowing for precision movements and accurate departure without the cues being noticeable. In Western, the spurs are much bigger to allow to fit around a Western Boot, they are also longer to allow for accurate movements due to the position of the riders leg in a Western Saddle. The Rowel at the end of the Western Spur also provides in many cases, a softer spurring, as it rolls rather than jabs the horse.

, If you were riding in a Dressage Test and your spur shank was too small, the horse wouldn't be able to feel the spur or your leg. In turn, the constant kicking would make the horse sore, and deaf to the leg. With a too-long shank, the spur won't touch the horse in the correct position, and will cause undue pain.

, If you're competing in a Western Class as a show, you will notice that many of the riders have flashy spurs. Shiny silver and gold that jingle and jangle. There is no need for a lot of noise in a spur, though it's a personal choice. Compare this to Dressage Riders, you will notice that the spurs often are longer for the advanced riders, and the top riders also have a Rowel on their English Spur. In all cases, refer to the rules of the show and if unsure, contact the Show Office for guidelines and restriction on spur size and shape.

, A Spur should fit snug around the heel of your boot, and should sit on the heel lip or the Spur lip depending on the type of boot you are wearing. Generic sizes are available ranging form child, youth, ladies and men's. Child's are made for small feet Whereas men's are made for size 11 and larger feet. Don't think just because you're a lady with a small foot, that your spur size will be a youth. The size will also depend on where it should sit and the length of the shank, as many spurs the shank increases as the spur size increases. When buying a set of spurs, the saddlery will help you choose the right size.

, Shank Shape comes into play when you ride Western. When you sit in a Western Saddle your leg is pushed forward and out. Whereas if you sat in an English or A Dressage saddle, your leg is almost flat against the horses side. This will determine whether or not the spur will need to be straight or curved and to what degree. Western spurs already are curved and you can buy them in varying degrees. It is best to ride your horse with no spur and get a feel of where your leg is in reference to the horses side and how he is traveling. A general guide is if you can feel the horses side then a short shank with a lesser degree of curve is needed, as you are less able to feel the horses side, a longer shank and a higher degree of curve is needed. English spurs already have a slight bend, allowing for close contact, these spurs do not come in varying degrees.

, In Australia for Pony Club, the spur shank should not exceed 30mm and must not be under 7 mm in width at point of the neck (Ref: PCA Rule Book). In Western shows, the regulations are different, as the Horse Welfare Officer will deem any cruel spurring or in-humane spurs illegal, and elimination may occur. All of this depends on society, organisation and rules of the Association.

, Straps come in various shapes and sizes depending on the use of the spur and the event it is being used for.


Many English Spurs have two types of straps; Leather vs. Synthetic. Both straps are good, and it all depends on what type of riding you are doing. If you are doing low level dressage or Pony Club etc, then a synthetic strap would be best, they are all weather durable and you can chuck them around in your tack box without having to worry about oiling them. If you're riding higher level dressage, show riding or hunter classes, then leather is probably the best choice. They have a classier look and often are more likely to match the colour of your boot, as they come in tan, brown and black. Like all things leather, regular oiling is needed. Leather however are less weather resistant, and if left un-oiled or left in the sun, can become dry and brittle. The spur will also wear more under the sole where the boot will rub against the spur, causing it to become thin in time.
Western spur straps are much larger and bulkier looking than English straps. And often they have more detail to the design. Generally a Western strap is leather, though you can by synthetic straps. They have a bigger buckle compared to the English spurs, and often sizing is limited Whereas English straps can be used on children through to men sized boots. Western straps come in varying colours and patterns. They don't have to match your boot colour; patterns can vary from thatched to woven leather and from silver studded all the way to fancier straps with crystals and gems. They require oiling and will need to be well taken care of, as English straps are generic, whereas Western spur straps are few and far between and only specialty saddleries stock them.

Watch your horse breathe.,
Locate a heave line on your horse.,
Listen to your horse breathe.,
Observe your horse’s coughing.,
Look at your horse’s nose.,
Watch for ‘asthma attacks.’ Heaves in horses is similar to asthma in humans.,
Determine if your horse is exercising less than usual.,
Take note of a decreased appetite.,
Observe changes in your horse’s behavior.,
Take your horse to your vet.,
Provide a detailed history of your horse.,
Have your vet physically examine your horse.,
Allow your vet to collect a fluid sample.,
Discuss the need for chest x-rays and blood work.",How to Diagnose Heaves in Horses," Normal breathing for a horse is quiet and doesn’t require much effort. Horses with heaves, though, will have trouble breathing, particularly during exhalation. Your horse will have trouble getting air out of his lungs, so his exhalation will be prolonged and difficult. The extra effort to exhale will require him to use his abdominal muscles, causing those muscles to get larger.A horse’s normal breathing rate is 8 to 12 breaths per minute. If your horse has heaves, his breathing rate may be as high as 36 to 40 breaths per minute.Count your horse’s breaths for a minute to determine his breathing rate.
Your horse may have trouble breathing even when he is at rest.;
, A heave line, which runs along the bottom edge of a horse’s rib cage, is a telltale symptom of heaves in horses. It forms when the abdominal muscles get larger from the continued effort to exhale.Don’t look for the heave line on your horse right away—it will take some time before his abdominal muscles enlarge enough to form the line.

, As you watch you watch your horse breathe, listen to his breathing sounds. With a severe case of heaves, your horse will wheeze when he breathes.If he has mild case of heaves, he may not make any noise when he breathes., Within the lungs, the airway inflammation caused by heaves produces mucus.This mucus can block the airways, causing your horse to cough to get the mucus out. Early on in the disease, the cough will be occasional, such as during feeding or exercising. It may or may not produce mucus.The cough with a severe case of heaves is very deep and produces pus-like mucus.Your horse's cough may become chronic., With all of the extra mucus in your horse’s airways, he may develop nasal discharge, which could look thick and ropy.In addition to discharge, your horse’s nostrils may flare when he breathes because of the increased breathing effort., If a heaves-prone horse is stabled indoors, he may have exaggerated responses to environmental allergens.These responses can look like human asthma attacks, in which your horse would have sudden fits of troubled breathing., Horses are very athletic animals. A horse with heaves, though, will have decreased athletic performance. If your horse has a mild case of heaves, he will not be able to exercise as much as he used to, and will take longer than usual to recover after exercise.You may need to spend more time cooling him down after exercise.


An inability to exercise in horses is called exercise intolerance. This intolerance will vary according to the severity of heaves.
For some horses, the only sign of heaves is decreased athletic performance.If your horse cannot exercise, do not force him to. This would make it even harder for him to breathe.

, As with other animals, horses need a proper diet to be healthy and maintain a good overall body condition. In severe cases of heaves, a horse can become unable to eat because of the struggle to breathe.If your horse cannot eat, he will lose weight.At mealtimes, watch your horse to see if he is able to eat.
Your horse may also drink less water than usual.

, The struggle to breathe can make your horse anxious or agitated.Neighing (a high-pitched sound) may indicate anxiety in your horse.Quick and aggressive tail swishing can indicate agitation.Your horse may also paw or stamp at the ground with his hooves if he’s feeling uncomfortable., Heaves requires a veterinary diagnosis.Since a mild case of heaves can become more severe, an early diagnosis could help your horse receive treatment before heaves causes serious health consequences.

, Your vet will primarily use your horse’s history and a physical examination to diagnose heaves.The more information you can give your vet about your horse, the better. Important details of your horse’s history include his overall health (e.g., current and previous diseases), diet, housing environment, and when you first started noticing his breathing problems.


Straw and hay contain allergens that commonly cause heaves in horses.If you use straw or hay for your horse’s bedding, your vet will need to know.
Tell your vet if your horse’s heave symptoms get worse at certain times. For example, heave symptoms can get worse when a horse is stabled, or out to pasture during the warmer months.Cleaning the barn can release dust particles into the air that can worsen your horse’s heaves. Tell your vet often how you clean the barn.
Horses that are predisposed and previously on pasture may show signs of heaves when they are stabled more than usual.

, Your vet will perform a thorough physical examination of your horse. To listen to your horse breathe, your vet may place a bag over his muzzle. The bag would cause your horse to re-breathe carbon dioxide and make him breathe more deeply, allowing for louder breathing sounds.When listening to the breathing, your vet will hear wheezing, as well as rattling noises in the trachea.Your vet will also assess your horse’s overall body condition, especially if he has been unable to eat.

, If your vet thinks your horse has mild to moderate heaves, then additional testing would be needed to provide more information about the extent of disease. A technique called bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is very useful for diagnosing heaves. BAL allows your vet to take a fluid sample from your horse’s lungs to analyze the inflammatory cells in the fluid.To perform BAL, your vet will sedate your horse and pass an endoscope or small camera through his nostrils down to his lungs. Your vet will then pass a saline solution down through the tube and pull it back up to collect the fluid sample.BAL is not recommended for horses who have severe breathing problems at rest.The turnaround time for this diagnosis is very short. Many vets can run the fluid sample in-house, which means a faster diagnosis and a quicker start to treatment.

, In many cases of heaves, x-rays and blood work are not necessary to make a diagnosis. In particular, blood work is usually normal with heaves.Chest x-rays can help rule out other possible causes (e.g., pneumonia, tumors) of your horse’s breathing troubles."

http://www.ecequine.com/Equine_Infectious_Anemia.html

,
Learn the stages:


Acute: This is a full onslaught of the disease and kills up to 30% of its victims.,
Take your horse's temperature.,
Check the heartbeat for irregularity.,
Offer your horse food near his usual eating time and observe him.,
Weigh your horse to see if he's been losing weight recently.,
Exercise the horse and see if he is unusually lethargic, depressed, or weak.,
Check the chest, stomach, and legs for abnormal swelling.,
Research horse diseases with similar symptoms and see if any match your horse's symptoms better or as well as EIA.,
Contact your vet if your horse has you worried.,
Coggins test your horse.,
Realize that having a horse with EIA is a major threat to neighboring horses' lives, and there are no cures for the disease.

,
Advise horse owners within exposure area to have their horses Coggins tested.,
Decide what to do with your EIA-infected horse.,
Reduce fly numbers around the barn.,
Keep a horse's bridle bit to itself.,
Use disposable needles when giving your horse shots or drawing blood.,
Sterilize any surgical equipment and similar instruments.,
Keep your horse happy.",How to Tell if Your Horse has EIA,", If your horse has this but makes it past the first 14 days since infection he should be okay.
Chronic: Chronic EIA horses go through the same severity of acute EIA horses but seem to recover after a few weeks. The symptoms then go away for weeks or even months until the horse has a relapse of worsened intensity, usually as result of being worked hard. Chronic EIA horses also can have rough hair coats, lack stamina, and be anemic.
Carrier: Carriers of the EIA virus will seem to completely recover from the initial attack, yet still carry and can transmit the disease., A healthy adult horse's temperature while resting varies from to 99-101°F (37.2 - 38.3°C), while fever associated with EIA can range from 105-108°F (40.5 - 42.2°C).


The fever of an EIA-infected horse can either be highly intermittent or continuous. It may help to take your horse's temperature several times throughout the day.;
, This can be checked by placing the hand under the horse's left elbow. Count the beats for 10 seconds then multiply the beats by 6 to get the heartbeat number per minute. A normal heart rate is 35-40 beats per minute.


Irregularity may be a sign of infection with EIA.

, A healthy horse likes his food and while eat it nearly as soon as you offer it. A horse that refuses food or has a reduced appetite, however, may have EIA.

, Don't be concerned unless there has been no change of diet and your horse has had rapid or chronic weight loss.

, Tiredness and depression are also signs of EIA.

, Swelling is another sign of the horse having EIA.

, Similar diseases include Piroplasmosis, African Horse Sickness, Anthrax, Dourine, Equine Viral Arteritis, Japanese Encephalitis, Equine Influenza, Equine Herpes Virus, and Babesiosis.

, He should be able to give you advice and confirm your horse's symptoms.

, This test is fairly inexpensive and only requires a certified vet sending a sample of your horse's blood to a lab. Usually the process takes 3-5 days.


A negative Coggins/EIA test result means your horse is not a carrier of the disease. If your horse continues having symptoms, tell your vet; your horse may be sick with something else.
A positive Coggins/EIA test result means your horse is an EIA carrier. If you feel the test was a false positive you can ask your vet to retake the Coggins, though you will need to pay for the test again.

,, This will reduce the potential of EIA spreading throughout the area.


Some areas say area of exposure is within proximity of 200 yards (180 meters) of the infected horse, other areas say within proximity of 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).

, Legally you only have three choices: Keeping your horse at a quarantine facility for the rest of its life, having the horse euthanized, or selling the horse for immediate slaughter.


There aren't many quarantine facilities, but one of the largest ones, Florida Research Institute for Equine Nurturing, Development and Safety, is located in Southern Florida.

, Large-mouthed flies such as deer-flies and horseflies will quickly spread the EIA virus by mechanically sharing an infected horse's blood with other horses.


Regularly clean and muck stalls/pens around the barn, depositing the manure a good distance away.
Eliminate any standing water; flies use these as breeding grounds.
Use fly-repelling sprays and fly traps around the barn.

, Infected mouth germs will share the EIA disease just like blood.

, This will prevent an infected horse's blood from getting into other horses.

, While this is a good practice anyway, the threat of EIA makes it an even better one.

, While diseases can definitely be fatal, a horse is much less prone to becoming sick if he's happy and well cared for.

Look for irregularities with your horse’s coat.,
Monitor for immune system deficiencies.,
Check for reproductive anomalies.,
Look for an abnormal distribution of fat.,
Look for other physical changes.,
Get a medical examination.",How to Diagnose Cushing's Disease in Horses1," Most horses have short, fine hair. A long, wavy coat, by contrast, could indicate Cushing’s disease.Additionally, a coat that doesn’t shed regularly in the spring is a good indication that your horse has Cushing’s.Irregularities of the coat is one of the most obvious symptoms that your horse has Cushing’s, and occurs in 85% of all cases.;
, Horses with Cushing’s suffer increased rates of infection. They also tend to heal slowly from wounds.If your horse is frequently diagnosed with parasites like pinworms (which are quite rare in adult horses), you should be suspicious as to why.These symptoms could indicate your horse has Cushing’s disease.

, Infertility during middle age is not uncommon even in otherwise healthy horses, but in a horse younger than 15-20 years old, it might be a sign your horse has Cushing’s disease.Additionally, a mare that produces milk when it is not supposed to - or fails to produce milk when it has a foal – could have Cushing’s., If your horse has Cushing’s disease, fat will build up in certain parts of the body. Noticeable fat deposits on the crest of the neck, the sheath of the penis (the prepuce, or covering beneath the penis), the tail head (the part of the tail closest to the horse’s body), and above the eyes., If your horse’s muscles begin to deteriorate, especially above the topline (the neck, back, and rump), you should consult your vet.Likewise, a horse that sweats in excess may have Cushing’s disease.Finally, look for a change in your horse’s normal stance. Your horse may appear potbellied, with a swollen or puffed-out belly. Alternately, your horse might become swaybacked -- that is, it’s spine might curve inward at an unusual slope.

, There are several tests your vet can perform in order to figure out if your horse has Cushing’s.Most of the tests evaluate the levels of different compounds in the blood.


Before having your horse tested, keep them as calm as possible, and keep your normal routine. Stress can alter the results of tests.One useful diagnostic test is the CBC (complete blood count). Your vet will draw a few vials of blood from your horse and measure the blood sugar levels, since horses with Cushing’s disease often have elevated blood sugar levels.
Another blood analysis test is the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). In this test, the vet will inject dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory agent that mimics cortisol. The next day, your vet will examine your horse’s cortisol levels with another blood test. An elevated level of cortisol indicates that your horse has Cushing’s.
Your vet might also perform a urinalysis test. In this test, your horse’s urine is examined for exceptionally high levels of glucose (a sugar) and ketones (molecules produced when the body turns fat into energy).

Stand at the horse's near side (their left), and put your left foot in the stirrup.,
Make sure your stirrups are even and the right size.,
Now it's time to walk on.,
When your horse is warmed up, you can trot on!,
When you want to canter, put your outside leg back and squeeze and make a kissing sound.,
Try to understand your horse.,
Take time to 'bond' with the horse you are riding.,
Be gentle.",How to Be a Good Horse Rider," Place one hand on either the withers or the front of the saddle and the other on the back of the saddle (and don't forget to take hold of the reins) and swing your right leg over. Try not to kneel on the horse! Before you mount, check that your girth is tightened, so you can fit one or no fingers between the horse and the girth; you don't want the saddle to come sliding off when you try to mount!;
, Sit right in the middle of the saddle and shorten your reins. Push your heels down and keep your chin up and look forward.

, Squeeze with your legs, or if your horse is a little lazy, give him a small kick. Try to keep your hands still, because you might accidentally pull him to much to the left or right. Remember not to rest your hands on the horse's neck!

, First squeeze, and if he doesn't respond give him kick or, if it is necessary, a small whip. Don't post until your horse is in full trot. Then start to rise.


When you are going down, go gently, so not to pound down on the horse. Once you have a rhythm, double check your diagonals. To do this you have to look down at the inside forefoot (when you are riding a circle, the front leg on the inside of the circle) and make you sure this leg is in front of the horse when your bum is touching the saddle. If you are doing the opposite and your bum touches the saddle whilst this leg is behind the horse's head you need to sit for an extra beat to correct it (sit down for two beats instead of one). You should check your diagonal every time you change the rein you are riding. So the when you change the rein (go around the circle the other way round) you have to again sit for an extra beat. This ensures you look like you know what you are doing as those who are advanced in horse riding would be the only ones too know this.

, If there is no response, kick, then tap him with a whip. Make sure he canters on the right leg.

, See the world from his/her point of view. Imagine having a bit in your mouth. This will make you think of horses in a different way.

, Always groom him yourself, and give them extra attention. Treats are good too, but only healthy ones, and don't give him too many, or he'll demand them all the time. Remember horses are living creatures, so you should respect them. Also when you are riding your horse, every so often give him a gentle pat on the neck- this tells the horse that he is doing something well or right and is a way of praising/giving affection to your horse.

, Remember to first squeeze, then make a clicking noise with your tongue, then kick. Only use a whip as a last resort. Horses are willing to please if you know how to ask them correctly.

Look for weird fluctuations in diet and weight.,
Check for chronic laminitis.,
Monitor for lower energy levels.,
See if your horse is drinking an excessive amount of water.",How to Diagnose Cushing's Disease in Horses2," Horses with Cushing’s might experience one of several strange and counterintuitive weight-related scenarios. They might lose weight if they continue to eat the same amount of food they always have. Alternately, your horse might start eating significantly more than it used to, but fail to gain weight. Finally, a horse with Cushing’s might gain weight, but eat even less than it did before.Keep an eye out for changes in your horse’s weight and the way your horse eats in order to get a diagnosis before your horse gets worse.

, Laminitis (also known as founder) is the inflammation of the tissue within the hoof wall. The condition is very painful and will cause the horse to be unwilling to walk or move. Your horse might lie down and be reluctant to rise. When it does walk, it will do so extremely carefully and may place the heel of its hoof down first (rather than its toes) in an attempt to spare itself from pain., Your horse might be depressed and lethargic if it has Cushing’s disease. You might notice that it only wants to sit in one spot all day, and acts less playful than it used to. These behavioral changes might just be a sign of old age, but they could also indicate that your horse has Cushing’s., A consequence and related symptom of this high water consumption is that your horse will urinate frequently and in high volumes. Horses with Cushing’s disease drink and urinate in slightly different amounts, but if you notice your horse begin to drink anywhere from two to five times the amount of water it normally drinks, you should definitely suspect it has Cushing’s.Most horses drink about 20 to 30 liters (5 to 8 US gal) of water each day.
Horses with Cushing’s might drink up to 80 liters (21.1 US gal) each day.
Instead of letting your horse drink out of a trough, hang buckets of water in their stall. Keep track of how often you have to refill the buckets each day so that you can accurately measure how much they drink.

"
"
Get medication for your horse.,
Try nutritional supplements.,
Avoid sweet foods.,
Engage in regular maintenance.",How to Diagnose Cushing's Disease in Horses3," After you notice several of the symptoms for Cushing’s disease, have your vet take a look at your horse. If your vet verifies that your horse does in fact have Cushing’s, they might give you a prescription appropriate for your horse’s age and condition. Horses with relatively mild symptoms respond best to medication. Medications for Cushing’s include:Cyproheptadine, pergolide, and other medications that reduce the amount of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), two biological compounds that affect that the operation of the endocrine system.
Trilostane and other medications that suppress cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands might also be useful.
Some medications – bromocriptine mesylate, for instance -- can reduce both cortisol levels and ACTH levels.Your vet will determine which medication would be best for your horse. Let your vet know if one medication isn’t working for your horse so they can recommend a new dosage or prescribe an alternative medication.
The medications will probably be orally administered, but they might be injectable. Always use medications as directed. Stopping the medication suddenly can cause problems for your horse.

, There are a number of nutritional supplements that could be beneficial to managing your horse’s condition. Magnesium, for instance, is one of the more commonly accepted nutritional supplements that might improve symptoms of Cushing’s disease. Chromium (or chromium picolinate) is another.These supplements are best obtained online but may be available at pet stores or stores that specialize in horse health.
After obtaining these supplements, use as directed. Directions for use vary based on your horse’s age and weight.
Talk to your doctor about administering additional nutritional supplements to your horse.

, Horses with Cushing’s tend to be insulin resistant, meaning they have high blood sugar levels. Therefore, don’t give your horse anything with high levels of sugar, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), or starch. Mints, sweet feeds, and other candies could push your horse’s blood sugar levels over the edge. Avoid feeds with added sugar or molasses, such as extruded feeds you might provide for older horses.Even some pasture grasses can have high NSC levels.Avoid or restrict pasture-feeding, especially during spring and fall when NSC content in pasture grass tends to be highest. You can also use a grazing muzzle while they are in the field. These will help limit how much grass they eat.

, A horse with Cushing’s needs all the things a regular horse does, but because of its precarious health, it is important not to miss a single veterinary appointment or tooth-brushing session. Pay particular attention to your horse’s nutrition, ensuring it eats and drinks enough for its age and weight. Get your horse dewormed regularly and provide vaccinations as needed.If your horse has laminitis, consult a farrier and a veterinarian to ensure it gets special hoof care.
Your Cushingoid horse might have trouble regulating its body temperature. Provide blankets in the winter and clip its excess hair in the summer.

",How to Collect a Urine Sample from a Horse," The first step in collecting a urine sample from a horse is to make sure you have all the necessary equipment before collecting it.;
, Gloves are optional and a good whistle.

, You may need to grab it quickly for a collection.

, Take it to its water and splash water on its mouth. Rub it around its eyes. This works in a similar way to a dripping tap.

, As you are walking, whistle. The whistle will sound like a strong wind blowing through a crack in a window, the high pitch but breezy sound. This may take a few minutes or it may take an hour; patience is essential! A well trained horse will urinate on cue to the whistle, so you are trying to teach it to associate the whistle with urinating.

, Eventually, your horse will urinate. This is when you need to be quite fast.

, When the horse has finished, make sure that it doesn't spill it over by turning the horse around on its haunches or pivoting on its hind legs.

,, They may think it's attractive enough to drink. Put a small amount in a urine collection jar (from the vet's) or into a small jam/baby glass jar. The jar must be sterile, clean and have a lid. The container should be quite full, but not quite to brim.

, If it has to wait a bit before you take it to the vet, label it ""Do Not Drink"" in case you have a less than astute fridge user. Throw any excess away.

Give your horse a blood transfusion only in life-threatening situations.,
Have the vet check your horse's PCV.,
Allow the vet to check your horse's blood hemoglobin levels.,

Look for symptoms such as fever, shaking and rapid breathing.,
Treat anaphylaxis with adrenaline and steroids.,
Use an adrenaline shot to counteract anaphylaxis and reverse shock.",How to Approach Whole Blood Transfusions in Horses," Because of the complications associated with equine blood transfusions, this procedure is best saved for life-threatening occasions when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.


Situations where this might arise would be severe, uncontrolled hemorrhage caused by a severed artery, or blood loss form the womb after foaling.
Another indication is severe anemia because of autoimmune disease, where the body has attacked its own red blood cells. In this situation, a transfusion may be appropriate to buy time while treatment kicks in, and give the bone marrow time to regenerate replacement red blood cells.;
, The main marker your veterinarian will use to decide whether your horse needs a blood transfusion is the horse's packed cell volume (PCV). This is a measure of the percentage of fluid blood taken up by red blood cells.


A healthy horse has a PCV in the range of 32-52%. The threshold at which transfusion is indicated is 12% or below.
At this level, the blood is unable to deliver sufficient oxygen to the tissues to maintain function and so supplementary help in the form of a transfusion is required.

, Another marker used by your veterinarian during the decision process is the horse's blood hemoglobin levels.


Hemoglobin binds to oxygen, so low levels imply inadequate oxygenation of the tissues. A normal level is 11-19g/dl of blood, if this falls below 8g/dl than transfusion is advisable.
Both PCV and hemoglobin can be measured by the blood machines that most modern vet clinics have on site, and the results made available within minutes of the test being run.

, There are 8 major equine blood groups: A, C, D, K, P, Q, U, and T. However, each of these groups is further subdivided into subtypes because of slight variations in the proteins (alloantigens) on the surface of the red blood cells.


The total combination of individual blood types has been calculated at somewhere over 400,000, thus finding a donor that is an exact match for the recipient is almost impossible.
Because of this, the aim of equine transfusion medicine is to cross match donor and recipient blood in order to eliminate the groups of blood most likely to cross react and cause a severe reaction.

, Blood donation from groups A, C, and Q are most likely to stimulate an antibody response if the recipient is not of those groups.


Horses with the blood group A, C, or Q are generally avoided as donors because their blood is highly immunogenic (over stimulates the immune system) and likely to cause a major transfusion reaction.
If the donor does not have a crisis with the first transfusion, if she receives a second then it a catastrophic reaction involving serious complications (as described in section three below) is guaranteed.

, Horses from the remaining groups, i.e. D, K, P, and U are considered safe donors. It is preferable for a recipient to receive blood from as close a match of group as possible, but if a group D horses urgently needs a blood transfusion, then a donor from groups D, K, P, or U is acceptable as these groups are classed as universal donors (safe to give the first transfusion to any horse).


The reason why finding a horse with as close a blood type as possible is because the horse's body is programmed to accept the presence of its own blood as harmless and not mount an immune response (produce antibodies) against it.

, Blood-typing is a simple procedure that involves applying spots of the donor horse's blood to a special test plate.


This test plate is impregnated with antibodies to each of the different blood groups. When the sample is applied, the blood cells either clump together or burst. The one test plate where the blood does not clump together denotes the correct blood type, because it has not triggered a reaction.
In an ideal world both donor and recipient would be typed and as close a match as possible given (i.e., a group U horse would receive group U blood.) However, in an emergency situation this may not be possible, so only the donor horse is typed to ensure he is a universal donor (groups D, K, P, and U).

, The donor horse is confined to a stall or stock. A patch of hair is clipped over the jugular vein in the neck and the skin is disinfected with a surgical scrub such as hibiscrub or iodine.


A large gauge catheter (10gauge) or needle (14gauge) is required so that the red blood cells are not physically damaged as they flow through into the collection tubing and container.
The needle is inserted into the vein and the hub connected to blood collection tubing. This is a length of clear, flexible, sterile tubing through which the blood flows into a collecting container.

, The blood collection container contains a vacuum, so the negative pressure continues to suck the blood out of the donor horse's circulation. The bottle contains ACD preservative which stops the blood from clotting once it has been collected.


As the blood is collecting, gently swirl or rock the bottle to mix it with the preservative. Never shake the bottle, as this could cause the red blood cells to become burst or damaged.
The maximum volume of blood that can be collected from one horse is 15-18 ml/kg body weight, once a month. Thus a 500-600kg horse provides approximately 7.5 liters (2.0 US gal) of blood per month, and it takes around 1.5 hours to harvest.
Once obtained. a blood sample should be used within 4 hours.

, The recipient horse's jugular vein is prepared in the same way as for the donor horse, and a 10g catheter or 14 gauge needle inserted into the vein.


The giving set on the blood container is attached to the needle or catheter and the blood is elevated above the horse's head to allow gravity to assist with the delivery.

, The recipient horse's heart and respiratory rate, body temperature, and the color of the mucus membranes of the mouth are recorded before the transfusion starts, and every 2 minutes thereafter for the first 10 minutes of the transfusion.


For the first 10 minutes the transfusion is given slowly, at a rate of 0.1ml/kg body weight. This allows the veterinarian to check for the early signs of a transfusion reaction. If a transfusion reaction is detected, the transfusion will be stopped before the recipient receives a large volume of donor blood.
If no signs of a reaction occur, then the flow rate is increased to 20-30ml/kg body weight per hour. Thus a transfusion involving a 500kg horse receiving 7.5 liters (2.0 US gal) of whole blood takes half an hour to complete.

, A blood transfusion buys the horse enough time to manufacture new red blood cells in the bone marrow. The transfusion provides enough increase in circulatory volume to stop damage to the major organs and take the horse out of immediate danger.


However, the horse will still be weak following the transfusion and a period of box rest to aid recovery is essential. This also enables the horse's food intake to be monitored, along with her water intake and urine output.
Closely monitoring these things is very important, because if the hemorrhage was severe enough to cause organ damage, the early warning signs are increased thirst, and increased urine production.

, The recipient horse should be fed a highly nutritious, iron-rich diet following the blood transfusion, to ensure that they have all the nutrients necessary for red blood cell production.


These diets usually consist of a highly palatable muesli formulation that is protein dense and provides a greater density of calories than regular foods. Thus, if the horse's appetite is reduced, they still take in energy.
This muesli also has added B vitamins to help appetite, and is rich in antioxidants to encourage healing.

, A blood transfusion is considered a success if the donor cells survive 5 to 7 days in the recipient's circulation. This is because the huge range of equine blood types makes an exact match almost impossible.


The aim of the transfusion is to buy time while the recipient's bone marrow makes replacement red blood cells. For a first blood transfusion, the recipient's immune system swings into action over a relatively long period of a few days.
For a second transfusion, (where antibodies to the foreign blood already exist) or if an incompatible blood type is given, a much more violent, or anaphylactic reaction can happen.
Other potential complications include transfusing the horse with infected blood, or giving blood that contains too much anti-coagulant. The latter interferes with the natural clotting ability of the blood and could lead to hemorrhage.

, Anaphylaxis is a classic type I hypersensitivity reaction. In short, it causes the body to activate its immune system to get rid of foreign cells, but the immune system overreacts and the body goes into a state of shock and circulatory collapse.


If the transfusion continues, or treatment for the anaphylaxis is not given, the horse will collapse and die - sometimes as soon as 20 minutes after starting the transfusion.

, As mentioned above, an anaphylactic reaction is the sudden switching on of the recipient horse's immune system such that it attacks the donor blood cells, causing them to burst within a few minutes of administration.


These damaged cells release their contents, including potassium and hemoglobin, into the blood stream. Signs that this is happening include fever, shaking, rapid shallow breathing, a racing heart rate, jaundiced whites of the eyes and gums, and urine with a bright orange or strong yellow color.

, If the horse starts to shake, breathe quickly, and has an erratic heart rate the transfusion must be stopped and treatment for anaphylaxis must be administered immediately.


Treatment involves the administration of adrenaline at a rate of 1:1000, 5ml per 500kg body weight by intramuscular injection. This improves circulatory function.
An intravenous steroid injection should also be given to switch off the immune reaction that is destroying the cells. The dose is 0.5-1mg/kg of dexamethasone, which is equivalent to 20ml of 0.2% solution for a 500 kg horse.

, Adrenaline is a hormone and nerve transmitter that stimulates specific receptors in blood vessels and the heart, helping to reverse shock.


It does this by causing a contraction of the minor blood vessels, allowing the blood volume to become concentrated in the major blood vessels. This provides a greater supply of blood to the vital organs.
Adrenaline also causes the heart to pump more strongly and hence push blood around the circulation more effectively. This allows oxygenated blood to reach the brain and other vital organs more quickly.

Push your heels down and lean back.
,
Apply steady pressure to the bit.,
Lift your legs forwards to help you lean back more.,
Use your (or, the horse's) verbal command for backing.,
Reward the horse as soon as he backs for you!",How to Back Up on a Horse,", Don't pull hard on the reins, just grip firmly and pull back with as little pressure as your horse will respond to.

Don't pull and release on and off. Just pull and hold.

, This is optional depending on how well the horse can read your cues, but may need to be exaggerated if the horse still doesn't know what you're asking., Keep asking verbally and with your body until the horse backs.

Realize that if you're working a young horse, or a new horse for you, you shouldn't ask too much of them at first. Have him back a few steps, then reward him! Gradually increase the amount the horse backs until he does so without a problem.

, Mainly do this by releasing the pressure on the bit and re-shifting your weight, but also by using verbal praises and a few scratches to the withers.

The newer the horse is to backing, the more you should praise him when he reacts correctly. With a more experienced horse, the release of the pressure on the bit should be enough of a reward.

Sit deep in the the saddle.,
Give a verbal command.,
Gently pull back on the reins.,
Troubleshoot.,
Come to a stop.,
Learn an emergency stop.",How to Halt a Horse1," Most beginners forget that your position in the saddle is the first tool for halting a horse. Shift to sit deeply in the saddle, with your whole body weight pushed down onto your heels. Pretend you're trying to push your butt onto the ground right through your horse. This ensures that the horse feels the communication from your ""seat,"" or the pelvic bones against the saddle.


You may feel the need to lean back. Resist this urge, as it can unbalance you and the horse. Only lean back enough to shift your weight.
Tighten your abdominal muscles as well; your horse will feel this tension.
This becomes more effective with practice. As you learn to allow your seat to move with the horse's pace, the horse will become more responsive to your cues.;
, Say ""whoa,"" ""ho,"" or ""halt,"" depending on which command your horse has learned. Speak in a slow, calm voice, audible but not loud. Do not yell or speak quickly.


You may do this at the same time you shift your weight.

, Pull straight back toward your belly button or hips, without much pressure. In English riding, use very light half halts. In Western riding, if you have a two handed bit, pull each side separately. If you have a one-hand bit, pull that back.


An experienced horse should not need much force on the reins. If the horse refuses to listen, continue to pull until it does. A novice rider should always ride an experienced, well-behaved horse.
If the reins are too long to pull taut, the horse cannot feel your cues. Having short reins will ensure that the message is recieved.

, If you still have trouble establishing a halt, check for these common issues:


Ensure your legs are not squeezing the horse.
Keep your shoulders back.
Do not lift your hands up when halting. Keep them at the same height as they were when you were going forward. If the hands are raised, the horse may not understand your cue.
A horse wearing a strong bit, such as a three ring gag or a curb bit, will be more sensitive to the reins. Use a softer touch so you do not injure the horses mouth. Beginners should stick to mild snaffle bits.
Untrained horses may require a stronger hold on the reins. Beginners should stick to well-trained horses.

, As soon as the horse comes to a complete stop, hold for one second, then return to your normal seat position. If you hold for too long your horse may back up and become confused and annoyed.


If the horse is untrained, release the reins as soon as it stops to reward the behavior.

, Ask a trainer to teach you an emergency stop, to be used when the horse is running toward danger or when you lose control. This takes skill and practice to perform safely, and due to the risk of falling should only be done in an emergency. Here's the basic idea:


Reach forward and grab one of the reins about halfway up the horse's neck.
Pull the rein to your knee while sitting back. This will bend the horse's head back near your legs. The horse should slow and stop.
If your horse doesn't stop, stay calm and gently pull him to one side steadily, causing him to circle repeatedly until he slows and halts. Do not pull hard, or he may fall!
If the horse is frightened after stopping, carefully stroke him and use a soothing voice to calm him down.

This includes older horses and horses with a slight injury, as long as they can still take a rider. A calm temperament is the most important feature of a therapy horse. The horse should also be quiet, friendly, and enjoy handling even from strangers.


Draft horses and other large horses tend to be calmer than smaller ones.
Some breeds tend to be calmer than others, but upbringing and individual characteristics make a big difference. Don't make a snap judgement based on appearance or breed reputation.;
, Approach from the front and slightly to one side, so the horse has a clear view of you. Let the horse sniff you and check you out before you continue.

, If the horse pulls its ears back, it may be nervous about your approach. Stop walking and see if the ears relax again. Keep an eye on the ears during the steps below to see if the horse calms down. If the ears remain agitated during your whole visit, the horse may be on the anxious side.


If the ears are turning to the side or forward, the horse is probably curious.

, Start with your hands flat along the horse's neck, rubbing in the direction of its hair. Rub with slow, even strokes and avoid sudden movements. Give the horse a minute to get used to you, then move your hands down along its back and side. Stay within view of the horse and watch its ears. If it doesn't relax within a few minutes, move on to a different horse.

, If the horse is still calm, gently lean against its flanks. A well-trained horse should give way to this pressure instead of pressing back. If it does give way, reward the horse by relieving the pressure.

, Pick up the lead line and try leading the horse from the ground. A therapy horse should agree to move at a human walking pace. If it tries to get ahead, pushes you, or refuses to walk, it has poor ground manners. Pick a different horse.


If the horse licks its lips and hesitates, it's probably considering what to do. Let it think for a minute or two before you insist that it follows you.

, Many trainers desensitize horses by handling plastic bags around them until they relax. See how the horse reacts when you show it a plastic bag from a distance. If it doesn't react, move closer slowly. Let the horse sniff the plastic bag, then run it along its side. If there's still no reaction, tie the bag to the end of a lounge line and rub it against the horse's legs, standing outside of kicking range. Stop at any point if the horse starts showing alarm. Many horses will spook in this situation, which makes them unsuitable as therapy horses.

, Depending on the person who will be riding the therapy horse, the following trained behaviors may come in handy:


Excellent response to voice commands
Stopping immediately when the rider falls off.
Responding to ""ground tie"" commands (staying completely still)

, If the horse has passed all these tests, it's time to see how the horse reacts to a rider. If you are a competent rider with full mobility, you may try this yourself. Otherwise, have an experienced horse owner try it for you. The horse should be very cooperative and move at a slow, steady pace. If the intended rider has limited mobility or coordination, the horse should be trained to move at a smooth, comfortable jog or lope to make it easy to stay on.


Ride around other horses, unfamiliar people, and loud noises to see how it reacts.
The disadvantaged rider may tug the reins harder or give leg cues lower down than most riders. Test this out to see if the hose can handle it calmly.

, Any reputable seller should agree to let you do this before buying. See if the horse remains calm in unfamiliar areas, including noisy places such as rodeos. Give it at least two weeks and let several strangers handle it before you commit to selecting it.


You and the seller should sign a contract agreeing on what to do if the horse becomes sick or injured during the trial period. You may want to check with the horse's veterinarian, farrier, or trainer first to see if there are any problems you should know about.
Unscrupulous sellers may even sedate the horse before you inspect it. The trial period will provide time for the drug to wear off.

The best way to do this if you're an inexperienced rider is to find an equestrian center or horse ranch in your area that leases horses or provides horseback riding lessons for inexperienced beginners.


If you have access to a horse and horseback riding equipment, you can safely skip this section and move on to the next section to learn how to handle and prepare a horse for riding. However if inexperienced and not under supervision, riding under the supervision of trained coach would be both safer and a more enjoyable experience.;
, If you or your parents don't want to buy a horse, you can always have a loan or lease a horse from your local riding school, pony club, or from a friend who may have stopped riding due to study, work or injury. Leasing is often cheaper as you and the owner agree on who should pay for what, most of the time the real owner pays for vet and the first pair of shoes. The rest is up to the new family. It is important to have the veterinarian look over the horse for possible health issues before purchasing, to avoid possible dishonest buyers. Do not buy or lease a horse unless you are ready to care for one. If you don't know the basics then this is a wrong move and you could end up either injuring the horse or even just selling it only weeks or months later as you may not be experienced enough.


If you're considering buying a horse outright, it's important to make all the considerations of price before you get too attached. Horses are living creatures, requiring feed, water, and attention every day, as well as a clean pasture area and stable or stall to protect it from the weather. They also require regular veterinary care, and hoof care by a qualified farrier, who trims the hooves and re-shoes the horse when needed. Also, don't just ride your horse for a day a week. Horse riding is a large commitment, and before you buy, remember your horse needs a lot of attention.

, The saddle helps many young and old riders stay on the horse, it is a means of providing comfort for riders over long distances. They come in many styles and varieties, and learning to size your saddle appropriately is an important part of riding.


When selecting a size, make sure you have the horses height and breed as well as conformation and size. A child rider usually is a 10 inch or so, but some saddles are suited to stocky fat ponies and some are suited to elegant lanky horses.
Most beginners should start with ""General"" or ""All Purpose"" saddles, though saddles come in many styles and varieties each depending on the style and purpose of riding. A Western Saddle is usually only used for Western riding, while a Jumping Saddle is used for Show Jumping.
The saddle cloth should be large enough to fit the saddle and have about an inch or two all the way around the saddle. This helps protect the saddle and stops the saddle from pinching the horse.

, The bridle provides a means of control. Specifically, the bit helps control the horse, the reins help to turn. Though this is only partly true, your riding instructor will do the teaching, so you only need to know what type is better. ALWAYS KNOW THAT: You do NOT have to use a bit. Do some serious research before putting a piece of metal in your horses mouth. Look up some things on YouTube (Think Like A Horse does a good job of explaining what it does to your horses mental and physical state.) And please, do not get a bit with shanks on them. If you are a true horseman, you should not need leverage to control your animal. There should be a mutual bond between you, not one of hate and pain. Though, if you do want to use a bit, please be gentle and get a snaffle bit. (Please also note to not get a tom thumb bit, they are one of the worst kinds of bits, and just because it has a break in the middle of it does not mean that it is automatically 'kind') There are MANY types of bridles that are better than the one's with bits. There are hackamores and side pulls. They are all good alternatives.


The bit and bridle must be proper for the horse, and different bits and bridles must be tried with the horse to find the best combination, as each horse is unique and sensitive to minute changes within the bridle setup.
It's usually recommended that this component be handled by a trainer or other person highly experienced with horses, as an improperly chosen bit or poorly adjusted bridle may possibly endanger the horse while attempting to ride.
Note that you should have one wrinkle when putting in a bit, or less.

, Brushing a horse helps blood circulation, lets the rider bond with the horse, and makes him clean and shiny. You should always groom a horse before going for a ride and after, before removes any dirt and prickles that may cause the horse to react as he is in pain. A basic grooming kit should have:


Curry Comb, used to remove dry dirt and excessive hair
Dandy Brush, which is a stiff brush used to remove mud and hard stains
Body Brush, which is a soft bristled brush for bringing a shine and used on the face and delicate areas)
Hoof pick, to remove mud and stones from hooves
Mane comb, used to brush mane and forelock
A sponge for cleaning the nose and eyes and removing sweat marks after riding

, This should technically be bought before the rider buys saddles, blankets, brides, bits and all those other equipment. This should probably be bought before a horse is bought or leased.The rider should have a helmet designed specifically for riding, that is ASTM/STI certified. Helmets such as bike helmets are not satisfactory, as riding helmets cover more of the head and are specifically designed for safety against falls while horseback riding.


Boots should be flat-soled, preferably pointed, and they must have a heel, all to facilitate the easy removal of the boot from the stirrup should anything go wrong.
Jodhpurs are tight pants designed specifically for riding, and are usually considered the best choice, giving the most flexibility and give for riding. When you're first starting, any durable pair of pants would be satisfactory, as long as they allow for a full range of movement.
Riding shirts should have sleeves to prevent sunburn, or simply any shirt which breathes well, for comfort while on the horse. Gloves may be another choice, as some may see their fingers irritated by the reins, or they may prefer the grip provided by the material.

, Start with barn chores at a quality stable first, if there is one nearby, to become familiar with horses and to get used to being around them. Many stables are happy to have a volunteer. In return they might let you ride their horses, and you will become acquainted with the horses, their temperaments, and body language.

, This is important both in ""bonding"" with a horse, if you are fortunate enough to ride the same one regularly, and also gives you a chance to look the horse over for problems or injuries before and after a ride.


Feed and water the horse if you have opportunity, once again cementing a bond with the animal, earning its trust, and learning to trust it, as well. Many people are surprised, when they find themselves ""up close, and personal,"" with a horse; with how large and powerful they truly are.

, Use the curry comb, dandy (hard) brush, and body (soft) brush, in that order. The curry comb should be used on the neck, body, and about halfway down the horse's legs, and likewise for the hard brush. The body brush is the only brush that should be used all the way down to the horse's hooves.


Do not brush the horse's face; use a towel or a grooming glove on this area.
Pick up the horse's hooves and use a hoof pick to clean out dirt and mud if they appear to be dirty. Pick them up from the side, never stand directly behind or in front of a horse's legs, for safety reasons.

, Bring your tack out of the tack room, check it over to make sure it is clean and in good shape, with no holes or tears in the leather. Set it down, preferably on a rail, saddle rack, or stand. Ensure that it is out of the way of other riders.

, Catch or call your horse, and put on the halter. This is the leather or nylon harness that goes over the horse's head, and you will want to strap it tightly enough so it doesn't slip, but not tight enough to be uncomfortable for the horse. Ensure that it is completely on the horse's head; many an escaped horse could have been avoided had they simply ensured that the halter was on completely.



Lead the horse into the barn and attach the cross ties to the metal ring on the halter near the horses mouth. If there are two rings, the cross ties should be clipped to the metal loops on the sides, closest to the horse's mouth.

, Standing on the horse's left side, slide the saddle blanket over the horse's back, with the front of the blanket just at the ridge of the front shoulders. Do this without sudden, jerking motions, as your horse may spook at any startling movement.


Make sure that the side in contact with the horse is smooth. Often, one side of the girth will have leather tabs sewn down to hold the buckles, while the other is smooth. These tabs must not be face down, as this may cause the horse to experience undue discomfort. saddles have three leather tabs to buckle the girth to, use the two outside leather tabs, ensuring that the middle tab runs beneath the girth and is not twisted or forming any sort of bump.
Pull the girth (chest-strap) under the horse and pass the tabs on the saddle through the girth buckles on the horse's left side. Ensure that it is not twisted. To tighten the girth, pass the leather tab on the saddle through the girth buckle, and then pull up on the end of the leather tab, securing the buckle once the girth is tightened. Ensure that the girth is tightened, and if only one end has elastic, this end should be tightened last.

, Put the bridle on your horse by holding it in your non-dominant hand and using the dominant hand to work the bit into the mouth. Secure all of the straps. The cavesson (strap passing around the muzzle) should be just tight enough to get one finger between it and the horse. The throat-latch, which passes near where the horse's head meets the neck, should be tight enough to remain in position without being tight. It should be relatively loose, with multiple fingers fitting between it and the horse.



Walk the horse to a mounting block if so desired. Check that the girth is tight, the saddle should not shift significantly when attempts are made to move it. You should be on the horse's left side at this point.

, Catch the reins in your left hand, then grasp the horse's wither, mane, or the saddle horn with your left hand and the back of the saddle with your right. Do not pull on the horse. Place your left foot in the stirrup, pull yourself up, and swing your right leg over the horse's hindquarters.


Be careful not to kick the horse's rump as you swing your leg over his hindquarters, as he may begin to move if you do. Then again, they may do this anyway. It may be recommended to have someone else hold the horse while you are mounting.
Drop your right foot in the stirrup, lean forward in a semi-standing position just above the saddle, and feel if the saddle seems tight. If it has a tendency to slip, or doesn't feel tight, dismount, again on the left side, and re-tighten the chest strap.

, Pull up the reins, and get each at equal length while holding them over the center of the horse's neck with its head. The reins are basically the ""steering wheel"" of the horse. To turn left, you pull the reins left, so that the bit puts pressure on the horse's mouth, cuing him to move away from the pressure, turning the horse's head in that direction.


A second style of steering the horse involves the reins in two hands, where you hold one hand steady while the other exerts gentle pressure straight backwards, thus causing the horse to move away from the pressure, turning in response. The left hand is pulled back while the right hand is held steady, and so the horse turns to the left.
It's important to always defer to your teacher's instructions when you're just learning. The specifics of guiding the horse into motion are complex and take lots of practice. Learn from an experience horse rider.

, Urge the horse forward by gently squeezing your calves into the horse's sides. Most horses respond to verbal commands too, commonly, ""giddap"" or ""get up"" to go forward, and ""whoa"" to stop.

Remember that you will fall eventually, if you want to ride horses, there is nothing you can do to prevent that from happening, and if you don't want to fall, don't ride a horse. It is the hard truth. No helmet will protect you from breaking a leg or getting stepped on. Remember that horses are almost 10x more powerful, strong and willing than us. Even the mini's can do an absurd amount of damage. If you don't want to get hurt, don't get on the back of a living animal., As a beginner, it's important to stay away from fences, low branches of trees, or steep grades. Staying on a horse's back requires balance and concentration, and becomes much more natural and easy with practice. Be careful to keep the horse under your control, and watching for anything that may spook or cause the horse to rear up.

Attach a lead rope to the horse.,
Tug the lead rope toward the horse's chest.",How to Halt a Horse2," When handling a horse from the ground, you should have a lead rope, or long rope with a metal clasp on one end. This clips onto the horse's halter.

, This is the proper command to halt a horse when you are not mounted.


If your horse doesn't listen when you ask it to stop, make a fist with the hand that's holding the lead rope and gently push into the horse's chest slowly until it stops. Do not hit your horse, just apply the pressure with your hand and arm and it should stop. Be sure never to step in front of your horse as they may step on you.
Make sure your horse respects you and has good ground manners. If you have a horse that likes to pull and refuses to halt try using a chain around the halter. Ask an instructor or trusted horse person if a chain is the right choice for you and your horse.

Educate yourself on sexual orientation.,
Keep an open mind.,
Seek out community centers for queer teens and allies.,
Read a book meant for gay teens.,
Ask honest questions.,
Practice active listening.,
Participate in activities together.,
Avoid confrontation.,
Appreciate gay teens for who they are.,
Try and respect gay teens for their courage and effort.,
Set a goal of acceptance rather than agreement.",How to Understand Gay Teens," The first step toward understanding is knowledge. There are many resources, like the Trevor Project, that will aid in becoming familiar with sexual orientation and the general concerns of queer communities. Understanding that everyone is different and admitting that you don’t know or understand a gay teen’s experience is a key place to start and begin to move forward.Keep in mind that it is perfectly acceptable, and often common, to have differing beliefs and experiences from others. Learning about gay teens and sexual orientation is not about agreeing with their beliefs but about learning new information.
You may feel that through your own research you need to reexamine your own beliefs on sexual identity. Use this as an opportunity to be empathetic by communicating your concerns with others.;
, Try and keep an open mind when learning new information about sexual orientation, when asking questions, and when engaging in conversation. Keeping an open mind will help suspend judgement, stereotypes, and harmful generalizations that can often obstruct understanding and be the cause of unwanted conflict.Ask yourself questions, like “what would it be like to tell someone something I have never told anyone?” “What would expect from this other person?” “How would I like to be treated in this situation?”Stay calm and practice listening instead of immediately responding to feelings of conflict or contradiction.

, There are many national organizations, like PFLAG, that aim to bring queer teens and their allies together in order to advocate for their well-being and to educate others about the issues important to the queer community.Many community organizations similar to PFLAG also offer educational courses centered around supporting and communicating with gay teens., Reading self-help and support books written for gay teens will expose you to a number of relevant questions and concerns many gay teens have. Although every teen is different, reading books meant for gay teens will give a broad and more general understanding of their interests and concerns., Asking honest questions will show your sincerity in trying to understand what gay teens go through when coming out and living day to day. Being honest about your concerns will provide much needed support and establish open channels of communication.


Keep in mind that asking honest questions might also mean asking difficult questions.
Ask questions about whether they feel safe, what hardships they might have endured, or if they have told others and how their relationships have changed.
Part of understanding sexual identity means understanding sex, and in this case, gay sex. Familiarizing yourself with gay sex will help provide much needed structure, support, and guidelines throughout the rest of their young adulthood., Try and avoid spending your time together in one-sided conversation. Take time to listen to what the other person is saying and then respond accordingly to keep the conversation going.


Try and avoid being overly argumentative and combative.
Respond with questions and acknowledge the other person’s feelings.

, Understanding gay teens starts with yourself but that momentum will quickly fade if it is not followed up with communication and action. Finding new hobbies and activities, or reigniting old ones, is a great way to intentionally spend time and invest in gay teens’ lives.


Go to a movie together or go out for a coffee and chat.
Show your support and interest in understanding by also attending gay and queer teen support events like National Coming Out Day., Resist the urge to react based on preconceived beliefs and instead respond from a place of acknowledgement and acceptance. Phrase your opinions, concerns, and beliefs as questions rather than stating them directly.
Don’t try and change them. They cannot help being gay and they cannot change even if you or they want to. Using words like “right” and “wrong” more often communicate judgement than genuine concern. Instead, use phrases like “I hear you” to communicate an acknowledgement of their feelings.

, Sexual identity is only one, although important, facet of an individual’s identity. It is important to keep in mind that, like everyone else, gay teens are a sum of their total parts, of which sexuality is just one.Spending quality time with gay teens, whether it be a mutual hobby or a meaningful conversation, is a form of appreciation in itself. Appreciation can be internal and it can also be an action!
Let others know you appreciate them by telling directly.

, Whether or not your beliefs align with those of a gay teens, it is crucial to maintain respect for their decision to publicly and honestly be who they are.


Practicing empathy and putting yourself in their position is a great way to gain respect for others.

, Acceptance and understanding should remain distinct from agreement, that is, you do not necessarily need one to have the other. Keep in mind the importance of understanding, but know that understanding does not mean resigning or forfeiting your own beliefs. You can both be who you are and have separate beliefs while accepting each other.Be patient, it takes time get this balance of personal beliefs and acceptance right.

Teach your teen to be respectful.Communicating over the phone is not much different than communicating in face-to-face interactions.,
Explain to your teen how to place a formal call.,
Work with your teen to improve the quality of their conversation.,
Encourage your teen to speak up if necessary.Explain to your teen that phone microphones are often poorly made, and the audio on the other end might not be audible.",How to Teach Phone Etiquette to Teens1," Remind your teen that being polite, using language that does not deliberately offend or anger the other speaker, and waiting their turn to talk are all important habits that contribute to healthy, positive communication on the phone as well as off.


Share the “Golden Rule” with your teen. This rule describes a course of action in which you treat others the way you’d like to be treated. Always practice the Golden Rule and direct your teen to do likewise.
If your teen has trouble communicating respectfully off the phone, they will probably have trouble communicating respectfully on the phone. In this situation, teach both skills together.;
, If your teen is trying to call a business, make a doctor’s appointment, or get information from an official agency, they cannot use the familiar tone and language that they might when talking to their friends or family. In order to be taken seriously by potential employers, college advisors, and other authority figures, they should use a more direct, businesslike approach on the phone.Demonstrate formal telephone conversation. Offer a simple script he or she could use. For instance: “Hello, this is . May I please speak with ?”
Remind your teen that if the person is unavailable they should always ask, “Can I leave a message?” or “When would be a good time to reach him/her?”
Teach your teen to thank the person they spoke with before ending official calls.
Tell your teen to always state their name, number, and reason for calling when leaving a formal voicemail.

, What your teen says on the phone is as important as how they say it. Teach your teen how to have an engaging and informative conversation on the phone.You can play a game where you challenge your teen to answer questions with more than one word. Challenge them to answer questions with more than just ""yes"" or ""no.""
Teach your teen to ask questions if they did not hear or understand something. Instead of answering with silence or ""I don't know,"" they can say, ""I'm sorry. I didn't catch that. Could you say it again?""
Try roleplaying conversations that the teen might have on the phone. This will teach them how to handle these conversations.

, In these cases, it’s okay for your teen to speak up a bit and ask their conversation partner if they can hear them better.

Insist that your teen does not use the phone while driving.Talking on the phone while driving can be a distraction that your teen can’t afford.,
Ask your teen to think before using the phone in the company of others.Knowing exactly when to use the phone can be tricky.,
Teach your child to use the “10-foot” rule.The 10-foot rule demands that people who are on the phone are at least 10 feet (three meters) from others when talking on the phone in a public place.",How to Teach Phone Etiquette to Teens2," Tell your teen that talking on the phone is dangerous not only for them, but for their passengers and other drivers around them, too. Plus, in many states and municipalities, it is also illegal.


If your teen has a hard time staying off the phone while driving, suggest that they turn the phone off when driving, or leave it at home.
Remind your teen that talking and driving is impolite as well as unsafe, since he or she won’t be able to devote their full attention to the conversation.
Discourage your teen from using hands-free phone headsets or in-car audio systems, too. Just because they are hands-free doesn’t mean they aren’t a distraction.
More than 25% of all car crashes involve phone use, including hands-free phones., Many people of all ages use the phone in front of others. However, it is not always acceptable to do so. Using the phone when others are present can make other people feel that they are not important or aren’t being listened to.Ask your teen how they would feel if someone did this to them, or to recall a time when they actually experienced this situation.


Using the phone in formal situations – weddings, conferences, and club meetings, for instance – is usually not a good idea. Encourage your teen to ask themselves, “Would anyone be upset if I was using my phone instead of paying attention to the proceedings?”
On the other hand, when teens are hanging out in a casual environment with their friends, it might be acceptable for them to use their phone. Let your teen know that on these occasions, it is probably alright for them to use their phone. However, encourage your teen to stay off their phone if their friend is trying to communicate something important, emotional, or serious.
Advise your teen to pay attention to social cues to help them understand when it is and is not okay to use their phone. For instance, if their conversation partner remarks sarcastically about their phone use, they should take this as a sign that they are overusing their phone.

, If your teen needs to communicate with someone, instruct them to simply excuse themselves and go somewhere where their conversation will not disrupt those around them.


The 10-foot rule is also important for texting.If your teen is texting furiously, they might forget that they’re in a public space. To avoid other people looking over their shoulder at their conversation and snooping into their private business, encourage your teen to find a private space to send text messages and browse the web.

Direct your teen to make calls only during appropriate hours.,
Discourage your teen from using the phone when angry.If they text or call someone while angry, they might say something they regret.,
Turn the phone off as needed.If your teen is in class, in church, at the library or movie theatre, or at another function that demands silence, remind them to turn their phone off.,
Remind your teen to use their camera responsibly.Direct your child to always ask before taking photos of others.",How to Teach Phone Etiquette to Teens3," Standard phone etiquette means that you don’t place calls before 7:00 on weekdays or before 9:30 on weekends. If you call before these times, you – or your teen – might wake someone up. You should also not call during dinner time, since people do not want to have their meals and family time interrupted.Tell your teen that the last phone call of the day should be made no later than 10:00, since after that, most people will be asleep in bed.

, Ask your teen to think of a time when they were angry and said or did something that they later regretted. By helping them remember past regrets, you’ll help them understand why good phone etiquette means communicating in a cool, calm, and collected manner.


Alternately, or in addition to encouraging them to recall a time they lashed out in anger, you could share an example from your own life in which you said something (either in person or over the phone) that you later felt bad about. This is another way to help them see the dangers of using the phone while angry.

, If it goes off, it will both embarrass your teen and irritate those around them. And if you’re with your teen when their phone goes off at an inappropriate time, it will embarrass you, too.


At the very least, recommend to your teen to use the silent mode. In silent mode, the phone remains on but will rapidly vibrate so they can still receive alerts that they are receiving a call. They can then exit the quiet environment and go somewhere to take the call or answer the text message.
Encourage them to turn off their phone while studying or working. This can help improve their focus. Furthermore, if they are working with other people, their phone will not be a distraction to the group.

, Some people do not like having their photo taken. Good etiquette requires your teen to think about their privacy as well as their friend’s privacy when sending and receiving photos.


Remind your child that photos sent with “temporary” message services like Snapchat might not be truly temporary. To protect their privacy, encourage your child to refrain from sending inappropriate photos.
Teach your child to be cautious posting photos online. They should ask other people before putting their picture on social media, and they should not post embarrassing pictures of themselves. These can come back to haunt them later.

Get into your teen’s shoes.Try to see the situation from their eyes before you begin teaching them phone etiquette.,
Be able to justify each piece of etiquette.Your teen might not immediately understand why phone etiquette is important or how it can impact the perception others have of them.,
Be a positive role model.The best way to teach phone etiquette to your teen is to practice good phone etiquette yourself.,
Have a penalty system in place.If your teen is not conforming to phone etiquette – especially in ways that are dangerous or disruptive – remove their phone privileges for a set period of time.",How to Teach Phone Etiquette to Teens4," This will help you anticipate potential points of confusion and better understand where they’re coming from. Teaching anything well requires understanding your audience.


Observe your teen’s behavior on the phone before teaching them phone etiquette. That way, you’ll know what areas of phone etiquette your teen understands well and which areas he or she needs to improve.

, Think carefully about each piece of etiquette you share with your teen and, be sure you fully understand why etiquette matters.


You could provide specific justification for each piece of phone etiquette, or you could generalize your justification with a statement like, “Phone etiquette is an important way of showing respect to the person you’re speaking to and those around you.”
Ask your teen how they would like it if someone was using bad etiquette around them. For example, you can say, ""How would you like it if your friends were constantly playing on their phones while hanging out with you?""
Teens are intelligent and curious people. They may have follow-up questions about phone etiquette and how to best behave in a given situation. Listen carefully to their concerns and do your best to explain why they should follow a certain course.

, For instance, if you’re in the car with your child and your phone goes off, ask your teen to answer for you. They might be annoyed, but they will get the message that driving and talking on the phone is not good phone etiquette.

, Ensure your teen knows the penalty for not conforming to phone etiquette. The amount of time you forbid them from using their phones depends on your opinion of the severity of the offense. For repeat offenders who refuse to comply with good phone etiquette, you might ban phones for one week.
For a minor infraction against the rules of good phone etiquette, you might forbid phone use for just a day or two.

Use a planner.,
Make daily to-do lists.,
Use a calendar.,
Don't procrastinate.",How to Take Control of Your Life As a Teenager1," Teens often have to juggle just as many responsibilities as adults. A full school day, an afterschool club, practice for a sport, and homework can add up to a 12–14 hour day, at the very least. A planner will help you keep your schedule organized.Before the start of each week, write down everything that you plan on or need to do.
Get to know yourself and how long it takes you to complete various tasks, and set your weekly plan accordingly. Be realistic about what you can actually accomplish in one day to avoid over-scheduling.
Putting everything on paper will help you order your time, so you can be where you need to be on time, and complete high-priority tasks before less important ones.;
, Every night, write your next day’s to-dos. Use a notebook or an app on your phone or computer if you prefer. Try to complete the all of the items on the list the next day. This will help you put your task in order of importance, and help you develop a sense of commitment. Following through with what you intend to get done will get you far in life!Note any specific chores you might have to do at home, in addition to things you have to get done at school.
Write down a handy reminder if you need to ask a friend or teacher something
List your class and activities schedule so you can plan on how much time you need to get from one place or another.

, Just as you set weekly and daily goals, use a calendar to help you with longer-term planning. Write important dates on it like tests, sports events, recitals, birthdays, etc. Set long term personal goals in addition to things you’re required to do:Think of one to five things you’d like to accomplish each school term, like learning a new hobby or, if you're old enough, learning how to drive or applying to college. Break down each goal into smaller, regular milestones or steps.
Be realistic about your personal goals: don’t set yourself up for failure by saying you’ll do something that’s out of your reach.
Write the steps in your calendar and keep track of your progress to help you develop your long-term planning.
Follow this same “breaking it down” procedure for requirements like tests and papers.

, Try not to get sidetracked, lose your focus, or put things off until the last minute. If you procrastinate, you leave less time for back-up plans, and almost always set yourself up to be overwhelmed. Get in the habit of accomplishing a task on time, and if you say that you’re going to do something, then do it.Use your weekly planner, daily to-do list, and long-term calendar to help you stay on top of your tasks and projects.
Ask your friends to help motivate you to get things done instead of tempting you to put something off, and do the same for them.
Being proactive and learning early about how to get things done in a timely manner will help you stay in control later on in life, too.

Before you do anything, think.,
Decide whether you want to stay up with someone or fly solo.,
Get the items/technology you will want to use during this process.,
Listen for your parents.,
Listen out after they go to bed.,
Wait until you're sure they've gone to sleep.,
Keep track of time.,
Beware of noise.,
Get rest when you need to.,
Start the next day right.,
Conceal your tiredness.",How to Stay Awake Past Midnight," Why do you want to stay up late? You want to because one of your friends dared you to do so? You want to because you just want to be able to tell people that you stayed up all night? Once you find your answer, be determined to stay up all night.;
, Do you want to do this with someone or just by yourself? If you want to do it with someone, do it with somebody you can trust, like a close friend. Some people do this at sleepovers. If you want to do it alone, that's fine.

, Like your phone, iPod, laptop, notebook and a pencil, or some books and hide them. Keep them in a drawer or under your bed so if your parents come to check up on you before they go to bed, your parents won't be able to identify the items/technology. If you are at a sleepover, depending on how strict the adults are and how late it is, you might not do it.

, This is especially important if you know your parents normally check up on you before they go to sleep. You can tell if they're coming if you hear their footsteps on the stairs or in the hallway. Pretend to be asleep, because if people are sleeping, the person looking at them usually won't disturb them. Move around a bit while you're pretend sleeping and snore if you are known to snore in your sleep and if you drool, open your mouth a bit.

, Once your parents are in their room/rooms, stop pretend sleeping and try to identify their voices. If you know your parents watch TV before they go to sleep, wait for about 1 or 2 hours before taking out your things and playing with them. If you want to know right away that your parents are asleep, after waiting for 1 hour, quietly and quickly go to their room/rooms and check on them to see if they're sleeping. If they're not, and they ask you why you're up, say that you had heard a noise. Your parents lock their door? Try to hear their voice/voices through the door. If you hear them, quietly and quickly go back to your room and wait for 30-45 minutes.

, If your parents are finally asleep, reach under your bed and grab your things. If you put it in a desk drawer, crawl gently across the floor and open the desk drawer, take some of the things you want to play with out and crawl gently across the floor back to your bed. If your parents hear you and come to your room, quickly put your item/items in the closest place possible and do Step 4 again. If they shake you to wake up, groggily open your eyes and say ""What?"" with a touch of grouchy tone in your voice, to make it seem as if you really were sleeping.

, Ask your parents what time they wake up on a specific day. If you're doing this on a weekend, ask your parents what time they wake up on the weekends. If you are doing this on a weekday, ask your parents what time they wake up on a weekday. That way, you know when to stop the all-nighter. Because if you don't know when your parents wake up and when to stop playing with your things, it's going to be awkward when your parents wake you up for school or something and your iPod is right next to your face.

, While on your technology, if you plan to play an app that has a lot of noise, like the Temple Run games or the Sims FreePlay, either put earbuds on or mute the game's sound effects, so that way, your parents won't come into your room, take away your technology and probably go through it to find out what you do on your technology.

, If you have school or church the next day, 5 hours before you have to get up, put away your technology and go to sleep, since 5 hours of sleep is better than having absolutely no hours of sleep at night.

, At breakfast the next day, have an energy bar, a 1-hour nap in the afternoon and a good night's sleep the next night. Going too long without sleep with become a habit and is bad for your health. It's also dangerous.

, If you are a teenager and you're allowed to wear makeup, if you have dark circles under your eyes, use concealer/foundation to cover it up. If you aren't allowed to wear makeup and in the morning you realize you have dark circles, the night before, get a paper towel, drench it with cold water, squeeze out excess water, put it in a freezer and in the morning, put the paper towel under your eyes. Don't use ice because ice can kill blood vessels.

Understand the physical and emotional changes you’re going through.,
Eat right.,
Learn to cope with stress and manage your emotions.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Exercise and stay in shape.",How to Take Control of Your Life As a Teenager2," Your body and mind are transforming themselves. You’re full of hormones that make your emotions intense and difficult to regulate. You’re constantly in social situations at school and at home that exacerbate those emotions. Taking control of your life also means recognizing what’s out of your control: this is an awkward, rocky time in your life. It’s important to accept that.The neurological and hormonal changes and developments in your body can make it difficult to control and cope with your emotions. You may feel overwhelmed, confused, and out of control. Know that this is normal, and there are things you can do to help you stay healthy and cope.
Understand that adolescence is something everyone goes through, so don’t be too critical of yourself.
Don’t be too concerned about judgment from your peers or from adults. At some point, you will look silly, say something awkward, trip and fall, and so on: it's part of the deal.

, Growing and developing take lots of energy, and getting through a packed schedule demands even more. It’s essential to eat a well-balanced diet to fuel your growth and productivity. Never skip any meals, and always make sure to eat breakfast to get your day going on a full tank.Half of what you eat should be fruits and veggies. Balance the rest of your diet out with whole grains, like whole grain bread, brown rice, or oatmeal, and lean proteins, like turkey, chicken, seafood, and eggs.
Talk to your doctor to learn more about your specific dietary needs.
There’s no “right” number of calories to eat, and no universal portion size for everyone. If you’re a very active boy, you’ll need to eat more than a less active girl. Get to know your body’s needs and take this time while you’re young to establish long-lasting healthy habits.Teens should not go on weight-loss diets or try to lose weight by eating less unless recommended by your doctor., Your teenage years are a tumultuous time, and there will be times when you feel stressed and overwhelmed. Learning healthy, productive ways to deal with your emotions will not only help you take control of your life as a teenager, it will also set you up for success as an adult.When you find yourself getting upset, try asking yourself the following questions: ""What am I reacting to?""; ""What about this is making me so upset?""; ""Is this a fact or just an opinion?""; ""Am I jumping to conclusions?""; ""Am I putting more importance on this than it actually deserves?""; ""Will this be important in six months?""
Communicate assertively. Many people wrongly think ""assertive"" means ""aggressive."" Being assertive means you clearly and respectfully express your wants and needs and that you listen and honor the opinions of others as well. Don't expect anyone to know what you want or need — if you need some space, simply ask for it. Say something like, ""I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed right now. I need to just go to my room and be alone for a little while.""
Learn to breathe deeply. Feeling overwhelmed may trigger your sympathetic nervous system, known as your fight or flight response. You can counteract this with diaphragmatic breathing, in which you breathe deeply into your belly. Place your hand on your stomach and feel your belly rise as you inhale for a count of five. Hold for a moment, then exhale for another five seconds. Do this until you begin to feel calm.
Journaling is a great way to work through your emotions and vent. Try free-writing three pages in a notebook every day. Don't worry about spelling, grammar, making sense, or even being fair. Just let loose with whatever is going through your mind at that moment (just be sure to keep this journal private).
Find ways to reduce your stress. Running, meditation, doing something creative, going for a bike ride, playing video games, shopping — whatever positive activity makes you feel better and less stressed, give yourself permission to enjoy it.

, Most teens do not get the recommended amount of sleep, which is at least nine to 10 hours a night. Remember, those changes your body is going through take a lot of energy, and you need to rest to recover. It’s okay for teens to sleep late on the weekends, so remind your parents that your oversleeping is not a sign of laziness, but something that’s necessary for your body.Try to go to bed and wake up at regular times. Develop a sleeping routine.
Don't stare at your phone or computer right before going to bed, and try to listen to relaxing music or read a book to create a good sleep environment.

, Being active every day can help you gain control over your changing body, keep a positive mindset, and helps you to simply have fun. It’s recommended that teens be active for at least 60 combined minutes a day, whether through physical education or gym class, participating in a sport, or riding a bike.Get active outside to help cut down on your “screen time,” or the time you spend on your phone, computer, or watching television.
Try to make exercise a social activity, or a way of having fun with friends.

Decide what your priorities and values are.,
Don’t overburden yourself.,
Ask for help.,
Become independent.,
Balance being a young adult with being a kid.",How to Take Control of Your Life As a Teenager3," You have to set priorities in terms of the tasks you accomplish, but you also have to prioritize your values in order to take control over your life. Decide what kind of person you want to be, and make good, conscious choices that’ll keep you in control of your life now and well into the future. Ask yourself questions such as:What are positive personal qualities (like loyalty, generosity, honesty, being funny, kindness, and so on) that are most important to me?
What kind of an attitude do I want to have? Do I want to be a positive person who loves life? How can I make that attitude a real thing through my daily choices?
If I drink, smoke, or take drugs, what will the consequences be for my health, wellbeing, and personal character?
How do I want to express myself through the clothes I wear, the words I say, how I treat people, the activities I do, and the quality of my work?

, Don’t be afraid to say no. You might be faced with pressure to pack your free time with extracurricular activities to good on college applications, but understand that school and homework will give you a full eight-hour day on their own. Know yourself and know what’s too much for you to maintain your productivity and sanity.For example, you might really like to sing and love playing soccer. If you try to do choir and play soccer at the same time, you could burn yourself out or perform poorly in both. Play soccer, then when the season's over, see if you can join the choir.
Ask yourself if taking the time for any after school activity or job will hurt your performance in the classroom. Your schoolwork should always be your top priority!

, There will be many times in your teenage years when you feel overwhelmed or need advice. Ask your parents, other trusted adults, and friends to help you. Ask them to remind you of important events and to keep track of your responsibilities.Don’t put all your faith into other people, and don’t shirk your responsibilities, but never be afraid to ask for help or advice.
Keep your parents up to date about what you have due. Say: ""Hey, I have this big test coming up in three weeks. Could you help me make sure I study for it? Maybe you could quiz me leading up to the test date?""

, Sometimes it's tough for your parents to accept that you're growing up, and they end up taking away your sense of having control over your life. Try to understand that they mainly act out of love and a need to protect you. It's important, however, to communicate to them that you are becoming responsible and independent. The key is to let them get to know you as a young adult.Try spending more time out and about with your parents, like going to the mall or to stores together, out to eat, and other activities you'd normally do with friends. Show to them firsthand how you act in the outside world, that you can take care of yourself in a mature way.
Don't tell them that a friend's parents let them do something that you're not allowed to do. You won't get anywhere with that argument, and you'll just end up insulting their parenting style. Instead, tell them in a calm, clear way how their overprotective nature makes you feel and try to compromise with them.
Try writing a letter: sometimes we can express ourselves more clearly by writing. Jot your feelings down, let your parents give the note a read, and then have a mature discussion with them.
When you do go out with friends, stay in communication with your parents. Keep them in the loop so they worry less when you're out and about, and they'll be more likely to give you more breathing room with time.

, Being a teenager involves gaining independence and freedom, and it's a strange in-between time for both you and your parents. You have to respect your parents' authority, but you can also remind them that you're growing and developing your own values and opinions. It's important for everyone to be patient and use respectful language.Respect your household's rules and family's traditions. Your parents still lay down the law, and it's important to show them you care about the way they've decided to raise you.
Be clear and calm when you're talking to your parents if you want them to respect your point of view. ""Mom, lemme go out with my friends!"" is less likely to get a positive response than saying, ""Mom, can I go to the mall with Stacy and Jill? Jill's mom would drive us there and bring us back home at eight. That will leave me enough time to finish my homework before bed."" Negotiation, clarity, and specifics are key.

There's a difference between running away for a good reason (you're in physical danger) and running away for a bad reason (you just got in a small fight with your parents). Don't make a hasty decision in the heat of anger; you might regret it later.;
, Humans are social. We bond together out of need and necessity, but also because we gain satisfaction from being close to one another. Try to think about the people who will be seriously affected by your decision. You owe it to them. You may not know it, but they think about you all the time.


Think about your parents. Though it may not always seem like it, your parents love you deeply. They see themselves in you, and they want a better future for you than they want for themselves. Fights and disagreements happen with parents; their love for you never changes.
Think about the rest of your family. Your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers—all of them have a relationship that's deeper than just a friendship. It's very possible that your family will feel hurt and responsible for you running away, even if they had nothing to do with it.
Think about your friends. Your friends are the lifeblood of your social circle. They laugh with you, they make you feel better when you're down, they sometimes even think of you like a brother or sister. Running away probably means leaving them behind.
Think of other mentor figures. Maybe it's a teacher; maybe it's a friend of your mother's. Many of us have mentors who look after us. They want to see us succeed and be safe. Your decision will undoubtedly have an effect on them.

, Although most states won't punish minors (someone under the age of 18) for running away from home, several states consider it illegal. In Georgia, Idaho, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming, running away from home is a status offense, meaning that it's against the law if you are under 18.However, if your parents or guardians have tried to hurt you, you should get away and this is perfectly legal - but you have to do it in the right way. Tell a teacher or other trusted adult or call the police. Make sure you have a place to stay for a night or two before you do this, so you don't have to go anywhere weird.
You may worry that foster care will be worse than being with your parents, even if they hurt you, but it is better to risk it. You may even be able to stay with another family member or friend if you work this out in advance.
Even if you do run away in a state that doesn't have laws against it, you could still find yourself in court. Over 30 states consider children who chronically run away from their homes ""Child in Need of Supervision” or CHINS, a process which is designed to help children lead better lives. Still, minors who are in the CHINS process may face fines, suspended privileges, and mandatory drug screenings., Consider calling 1-800-786-2929 (1-800-RUN-AWAY) or going to http://www.1800runaway.org to talk about your situation and all the options you have.

, There are many reasons why a child would want to run away. Addressing the reason why could help you solve the problem before it gets so bad that you feel forced to run away. Here are some statistics:


47% of runaway youth described having a significant problem with one or both of their parents. Is there another adult who might give you advice about how to work the problem out with your parents? If not, consider calling Child Protective Services.
More than 50% of runaway youth in shelters said that their parents told them to leave or knew they were leaving but didn't care. If your parents ask you to leave or tell you they don't care about you leaving, call or visit Child Protective Services. It's not betraying your parents to want to find someone who cares about you. You deserve that.
80% of runaway and homeless girls reported physical and sexual abuse. If you are the victim of physical or sexual abuse, find an adult who you can confide in (it may be your parents, it may not be) and visit the police to file a report.

, Often, putting your thoughts down on paper has a soothing effect, making things more clear in the process. Here are some possible pros and cons of running away.


The pros:

Possible freedom from neglect, abuse (verbal, physical, or sexual), and/or harassment
Opportunities to travel, see new places, and meet new people
Increased freedom and the possibility of maturity and personal growth, no matter how hard it gets.
Development of self-reliance, a sense of being able to do things by, and entirely for, yourself.


The cons:

Increased likelihood of spending nights outdoors, on the streets, under bridges or overhangs, or even on top of roofs
Increased likelihood of depression, isolation, and powerlessness (32% of runaway youth have attempted suicide at some point in their lives.)
Increased likelihood of violence, drugs, disease, and prostitution on the streets.
Feeling like you have no one to talk to, like no one cares, or like the things you do don't make a difference.



, Often, we let our emotions make decisions for us when we think we're being rational. This can be a good thing, but sometimes it's bad, because we trick ourselves into thinking that we're being rational. To let your emotions cool off and really give yourself time to think about your possible life-changing decision, wait a week before doing anything. Reach out to people you can trust and perhaps talk it over with them. After a week, your rational brain will probably have had time to make a decision. This is different for each case, and so you should weigh the consequences for running away if your parents were to find you. Some parents get mad at you, instead of trying to help you. 

, Think of what you will do if any part of your plan goes wrong, and make up excuses for everything. Here are some things that you always need to consider:


What will you do if you get sick?
What will you do if you are caught?
What will you eat?
How will you maintain good hygiene?
How will you stay off the streets and out of harm's way?

, If you have someone who's helping you run away, and can stay with them at least for a little while, you're pretty much set. However, if that's not a possibility, where will you take shelter?

, Travel light; bring only the bare essentials. Now is not the time to set a record for pounds carried. Bring food, money, extra changes of clothing, a jacket or coat in case it gets cold, clothes with pockets, a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and anything else you will need. If you don't want to be recognized, take with you only the clothes you wear least often. Some other things that might be useful in your quest:


Utility knife
Maps
Umbrella
Combination lock
Blanket
A Jacket

, Maybe $10 for a bus or other transportation, and $50 just in case. If you plan to steal the money, find a place where you can get it fast without being spotted by your parents.


If you have a credit card, definitely take that, as it's much harder to steal and use, and you can cancel it at any time. Be prepared for your parents to possibly cancel it, however, when they find out that you've run away. Don't use it as your only source of money. Also, using a credit/debit card can give away your hiding place. The bank can track down your card, and see what stores and shops you've been to. Also the same with cell phones; they can track your location. You need to be aware of these things, and use them wisely.

, Make sure you have plenty of time to get away before anyone notices you're gone. Try making your move as soon as you get to school in the morning, or as soon as everyone in your home leaves and you know they won't be coming back for a long time. When you do book it, make it snappy. The last thing you want is for anyone in the neighborhood to notice you leaving.

, You will likely want to have a quick and easy way of getting around. The city bus is your best bet, or a long-distance traveling bus if you're leaving the town/city.

, You'll have to accept that at some point, someone is going to want to know where you came from, or what you are doing. You're probably going to need to do some thinking about this. Think of something reasonable and realistic, but don't say you ran away.


Keep it simple. You'll want to remember it everywhere you go because word gets out quite fast in this world about anything, so you should probably keep your story the same all throughout your life as a runaway, just to avoid arousing suspicion. Avoid inconsistencies by thinking out the details ahead of time.
If you are really serious about running away permanently, change your name. Have fun with it, but don't choose anything too wacky. But think about it, something common would probably be best because it'll be harder to remember, and your main aim is not to become too well-known.

, These places will usually have food samples open to the public which you can snack on, though make sure you take a cart with you and try to look like you have a purpose; don't hang around. Also, you can use the public bathrooms to wash yourself and do your business.


It's not glamorous, but you can always go dumpster-diving at the back of large grocery stores. You'll be seriously surprised about what people throw away. The more you dumpster-dive, the more your system will get used to food that's past its prime. In the beginning, it might be quite uncomfortable, but it should get better.

, If you don't have a place to stay, you'll have to find shelter elsewhere. Try finding a reasonably safe spot under a bridge, in an alcove, in an abandoned building somewhere, or perhaps in a public building that stays open 24/7. If these don't work out, try looking for the nearest homeless shelter, and check their availability.


If you just need a place to stay in order to pass the time, public libraries, churches, college buildings, airports, and train stations are all possible options. These places are safe, while generally having enough people about to make it easy for you to go unnoticed.
In the winter months, you may want to try to find a building with an elevator if you are in a downtown area. Try climbing the stairs next to an elevator shaft all the way to the top. You may find a room that is nice and warm, that not too many people go into.
Stay away from the woods or the desert. These places are generally very rural, and make it easier for other people to victimize you. As romantic as it may seem, it's really hard to make a living off of the land nowadays, especially if you know nothing about plant and animal species. Try to find places with other people around; they're usually safer.

, Panhandling is asking other people for money. There's not much pride in it, and many people will flat-out ignore you, but with the right strategies, you could be quite successful, and maybe even get enough to save some money.


Choose the right location. Find a busy place where people walk, such as outside a mall area, a convenience store, or a place where people come out with change. Ask patrons for money after they come out of the store, not before. Alternatively, ask drivers for money on a busy intersection. Make sure you're on the left side of the car, where the driver's side is.
Smile, and ask people for change politely and softly. You won't get very much money if you look mean or frustrated or unhappy. When someone does give you money, thank them with a smile and a friendly remark.

, Some people find faking a foreign accent tempting, but this is typically a bad idea. A foreign accent draws attention to yourself. People will want to know more about you and your culture, when you should really be trying to be as invisible as possible. Moreover, faking an accent is extremely difficult; it doesn't matter how good you think your foreign accent is, it matters how much everyone else does.

, This part is by far the hardest, particularly maintaining a healthy diet and a good hygiene. Hospitals are known to keep exceptionally clean restrooms, and offer good privacy. Here are some other tips that you can use to keep your hygiene high even if your spirits are low:


Use bathrooms in big grocery stores. There's not much privacy, but there's very little foot traffic. (Think about it: how often do you use the restroom in a grocery store?) You'll probably be able to give yourself a nice little hand-bath here and use some of the free soap provided.
Use generic sex-lube for shaving and straightening out hair. It sounds weird, but it works. Put a dab of lube on your skin and work it in gently with a bit of water. Shave up, being careful to wash the razor out immediately. If you need to straighten or tame your hair in the morning, a little bit works wonders, and it doesn't look noticeable afterwards.
Shower at public-swimming pools, as well as colleges and universities. If you pretend to be a student, colleges often won't ask you to show your ID. This won't work all the time, but it's worth the try, especially if you trick a regular into believing you belong there.

, Come up with a plan, and if you run out of suitable options, consider returning home, or if you're really true about running away, try to start a new life. Get a job, some shelter (no matter how bad, all you need is protection from the weather), and some friends in your new city or town.

, When you're down on your luck and you have nowhere else to turn, you can begin to feel pretty desperate. Try to control that emotion instead of letting it push you to do rash things. Get some good food into your stomach, even if it means spending every penny you have. Take a deep breath, even if it feels like wasting time. Think back to a time when you felt powerful and resourceful, ready to take on the world. Control your desperation by controlling your attitude. There is no problem that can't be tackled by a little bit of imagination and pluck.

, Keep in mind, if you do decide to hitchhike, that there are drivers that will do some bad things to you. They could abandon you or even hurt you. However, on the flip-side, there are also really nice people out there who would gladly take you with them. It's all about reading the driver and making a decision.


Try to hitch rides with a nice lady, a family with several children, or a car with passengers. They will probably want to ask you where you are going, or what you are doing, so have a nice little lie handy. Do not tell them that you ran away from home, and say as little to them as possible.
If a sketchy or scary looking person offers to give you a ride, ask them where they're going first. When they answer, tell them you're going to a different place, preferably far away. If they say that they can take you there, politely refuse and cut off communication after that. Wait for them to drive off.

, If you are in a big city with many people, know that there are likely people who could pose a threat to you. Bring something with which you can defend yourself, such as pepper spray, cleaning chemicals or perfume because perfume contains chemicals which can cause blindness. Being aware of dangers and avoiding them is usually better than having to confront them, however.


Walk away from people who pose a threat to you. Stand upright and tall, and keep your composure, but don't argue or aggravate them. Try to get to a public, well-lit area where there are a lot of people. There's usually strength in numbers.

, Don't let anyone do anything to you that you are uncomfortable with and if you get desperate enough that you feel you need to resort to this, seek help. Local charities and churches will help you without asking too many questions.


Prostitution is a common outcome of running away. Actually, a 1998 study showed that 43% of runaways, both boys and girls, were forced into prostitution after leaving home. That's almost half.
Because of the high chance of prostitution and also because of the poor sanitation conditions, runaways are significantly more likely to get HIV/AIDS. Be very careful.

, Homeless youth are significantly more likely to fall into drug and/or alcohol use. This can lead to diseases like HIV/AIDS or even death from overdose. This is just aside from the other side effects of drug and/or alcohol use. Be careful and do not use drugs, no matter how bad you feel.

, Homeless people are much more likely to be arrested, usually for being a nuisance, loitering, or trespassing. You want to avoid having to spend a lot of time in jail, so be careful where you go and how you look and act.

, Many people are homeless because they just hit some hard times and these people can be perfectly wonderful. But there are also a lot of homeless people that are very desperate, or mentally unstable. Especially in the US, where mental health care is notoriously inadequate, many mentally ill people end up on the streets. These people can be dangerous and may attack you for no reason. Try to avoid being around other homeless people to keep yourself safe.

Prepare for the scenario.,
Always smile.,
Walk away.,
Don't bully back.,
If the bullying persists, tell a trusted adult.,
Always stay calm.",How to React Nicely when Insulted," This is the situation:


Bully: You are so freaking ugly.
You: Really, because that isn't what people usually tell me. Thank you for making me more aware of my surroundings.

Hopefully, the bully or whoever it is will just walk away. Or maybe they think they are tougher than you so they say another insult. Such as:


Bully: Nerd.
You: Thanks.
Bully: You are such a freak.
You: *laughs creepily*;
, Bullies insult you to get you upset and see you go crazy, but if you're happy about it or just don't care, what's the point, right? They have no motive. If they see you're not bothered by it, even enjoying it, they'll leave you alone. It's not fun for them anymore.

, Just ignore everything they do and say and walk away. This will show that you couldn't care less about their opinion of you. All they want is a reaction, so don't give them one.

, Politely tell them that you don't mind their comments, but never resort to violence in return. This makes you look as insecure as the bully is.

, This will scare the bully because you told someone more powerful than they are. Tell someone they know not to disrespect. Also, by telling a trusted adult you are calmly showing the bully that although it's not bothering you, you know it's wrong and you're not afraid to do something about it. What bullies call ""Tattle-telling"" will make you look strong, not weak.

, The bully is thirsty for a reaction, they want entertainment. If an audience is there that's even better. By not giving them a show you are not letting them win.

Carrying an organizer with you. This can be done the old fashioned way with pen and paper or through the use of apps on mobile devices such as: Day by Day Organizer (Android); Organizer for iPhone (iOS devices).
Keeping a list of daily activities that need to be done either on paper or mobile devices. Helpful lists include: Any.do Task List & To-do List (Android); Wunderlist (iOS devices); and Pocket Lists (iOS devices).
Prioritize items on the list into important/not important and urgent/not urgent.
Update your list daily and mark off completed tasks.;
, Make sure to have a contingency plan in case you need an alternate way to achieve your goal.

, Cut out all distractions such as: TV, the internet, phone and video games. Give yourself enough time to complete the task by starting on it when you first get it. Don’t make a task seem too difficult because you’re more likely to procrastinate. Instead, break it down into smaller portions to make it more manageable.


Take a 10-minute break if you become unfocused.
Don’t strive for perfection because that puts off completing the task.

, Break them into smaller steps so that you can accomplish the goals at a slower rate and feel like you have completed more.

, Figure out points in your life that you spend wasting time and try to reduce them. An easy way to reduce wasted time is to keep track of your activity and log how much time you spend on each activity. Develop a regular routine that you can stick to that increases your efficiency.

, With more education comes more knowledge. Always be open minded to learning new things. Pay attention and learn as much information as you can out of a class/teacher. Use your knowledge to your benefit.

, A good education is needed for a good job. The unemployment rates for college graduates are lower than high school graduates. The annual income of college graduates is $17,500 greater than those with a high school degree.Since many companies prefer people to have a high education, finishing school will increase the chances of you getting a good job.

, Education gives you knowledge to understand the world that we live in. A good education helps you make better decisions. At school you need to learn essential skills that are need to get by in everyday life such as English, math and science skills.

, When going to school, try to learn from the experience of your peers and allows you to learn from them.

, Since many schools and colleges require group work, you will develop more social skills. You will learn to work together as a team which is a good skill to acquire for the adult world

, Always keep up on your studies. Be organized and do not miss your due dates. Set aside time to study. Try your hardest and accomplish your goals.

, Keep up your work and earn the good grades. If you do not understand something, then ask questions.

, For one month, keep a record of all your expenses. Don’t limit yourself because at this point we are just trying to establish a baseline. Save all of your receipts, make notes of how much you spend in cash versus credit cards and calculate how much money you have left over at the end of the month.

, After the first month, categorize your expenses (what you have spent in the first month). Don't write down what you wished you had spent; write down what you actually spent. Categorize your purchases in a way that makes sense to you. A simple list of your monthly expenses might look something like this:


Monthly income: $2,000
Expenses:

Household bills (utilities/electric/cable): $150
Groceries: $300
Dining out: $50
Gas: $100
Savings: $600
Rent/mortgage: $800



, Now, write down your actual budget. Based on the month of actual expenses and your own knowledge of your spending history budget out how much of your income you want to allocate to each category every month. If desired, use an online budgeting platform, such as Mint.com, to help you manage your budget.

, In many cases after people establish their budget, they don’t follow through with the planning and tracking. In other cases people will just estimate their spending. It's your money — there's really no sense in lying to yourself about how much you're going to spend when making a budget. The only person you hurt when doing this is yourself. On the other hand, if you have no idea how you spend your money, your budget may take a few months to solidify. In the meantime, don't put down any hard numbers until you can get realistic with yourself.


For example, if you have $600 towards your savings every month, but you know that it'll consistently be a stretch in order to meet that goal, don't put it down. Put down a number that's realistic. Then, go back to your budget and see if you can change numbers around to loosen up cash somewhere else, and then funnel it into your savings.

, Setting a budget will open your eyes to how much money you spend, if they haven't been opened already. Many people, after setting a budget, realize that they spend money on pretty petty things. This knowledge allows you to adjust your spending habits and put the money towards more meaningful areas.

, Setting a budget will also teach you that you never know when you'll have to pay for something unexpected — but that the unexpected will come to be expected. You obviously don't plan on your car breaking down, or your child needing medical attention, but it pays to expect these contingencies to happen, and to be prepared for them financially when they come.

, Volunteering allows you work on the social skills that are necessary for success in the work environment.

, Be eager and open to learning new things. Do not make judgments. However, be cautious not to be too overzealous as this can be a turn off to employers and coworkers.

, Always offer to help and assist when you think you can provide insight or new ideas. Look for areas where your personal skills may help to strengthen an area that may be weak in your groups performance at work

, Be sure to make sure your tasks are complete on time. Always pay attention to the policies of the assignment or in the office.


Abide by the deadlines as much as possible; try not to ask for extensions.
Volunteer to help others with their work when you are available. In turn, they may offer assistance when you need it as well.

, Connect with your co-workers. Take the time to get to know them.


Be assertive in your communication.
Be open to communication and feedback. Be able to take a compliment, but also be open to constructive criticism.

, Establishing a relationship with someone who has more seniority than you can be beneficial. They can offer insight and advice to help you be successful in your position.

Provide your foster child with a list of resources.",How to Support Young Adults Leaving Foster Care," The typical 90-day transition plan may not be long enough to fully prepare a young adult to live on their own. While laws are established to help youths transition from foster care, they may actually require more time to find housing and line up a job.A good transition plan should include securing housing and employment, practicing money management skills, and making plans to attend college or vocational school if the child wishes to.Life skills like budgeting, staying healthy, and keeping a job take more than 90 days to learn. Work with foster children to develop these skills before they are faced with the prospect of moving out.;
, Society often takes a negative attitude towards foster children’s futures. As a result, these children may grow up hearing more about their limitations than their potential.Affirming a foster child’s skills and ability to succeed can give them the confidence to believe in themselves and thrive as an adult. Give words of encouragement, such as “I have 100% confidence that you will handle your transition well.” Other things to say may include ""Congrats on getting your first job! I knew you could do it,"" or ""I expect great things from you in the future.""

, Encouraging academic achievement, future planning, and good social skills boosts a foster child’s self-image and reinforces their desire to continue these behaviors. Cheering on a foster child’s successes can give them the morale boost they need to keep working hard and making progress.


Many of these young adults don’t have a lot of supportive adults in their lives, so by caring about a foster child’s achievements and encouraging them to make the most of their potential, you can make a big difference in how they feel about themselves.
Express how impressed you are by saying “Wow! You got into college? You have always been so bright!”

, Some children in the foster system feel like they have no way to make their voices heard. As an adult, you can make a difference by standing up for these children and acting in their best interests.


Help foster children find and understand the local resources and opportunities that are available to them. Many of the young people aging out of foster care have never been taught how to find or use these resources. Take them under your wing and teach them the ropes before they exit foster care.
Plus, if you have 10-15 hours to volunteer a month, you can advocate for other foster children in your area by becoming a Court-Appointed Special Advocate. These citizen-volunteers help protect the rights of children who are abused and neglected by getting them placed in foster home environments. CASA volunteers are often the only constant adult in the lives of many foster children., Because he or she may have been abused or neglected at an early age, your foster child may not have felt he or she could depend on adults.Show that you are willing to listen without judgment and offer emotional support or guidance as needed.


Do this by simply saying ""You can count on me,"" and then let your actions align with your words. Encourage your foster child to call you regularly. Schedule a weekly check-in even when your foster child moves out, so that they can catch you up on their lives or ask your advice about how to handle certain issues.
Observe their behaviors and words carefully to spot signs of overwhelm or stress, so that you can intervene before they turn to unhealthy coping (e.g. drugs, alcohol, risky sex, etc.).
Invite your foster child over for a meal on occasion so that he or she feels a sense of social connectedness.

, Encourage foster children to get involved in a variety of activities and clubs. Help foster children maintain a healthy sense of self-esteem by giving them opportunities to develop their skills and interests. This can engender better problem-solving and decision-making skills.How can this help your foster child? Research shows that skills developed in childhood and adolescence can lead to employment later in life.
If you help your child establish his or her personal values early on, they are more likely to make positive, healthy choices later. Sit down with your foster child and suggest that they complete the Personal Values Inventory (PVA) to learn more about what values are most important to them.Then, think of ways they get involved with interests that support those values.
For instance, if helping others is important to your foster child, he or she may choose to start volunteering in the local community. You can help him or her find a community organization that can help fulfill that value.

, Teach foster children how to stick to a budget, save money, and handle routine expenses like housing and health insurance. Many young adults run into financial problems after aging out of the foster care system because they have never managed their own money before.A single mistake with money can land an inexperienced young person in financial hot water. Teaching foster children about financial literacy is the best way to prevent this from happening.Teach him or her how to pay bills and save. Give them opportunities to demonstrate their skill development by letting them pay the bills themselves after you have showed them how, or giving them a small allowance to start saving.

, Children who grow up in the foster care system often never have the chance to make decisions for themselves. Giving these young people the opportunity to handle real-world situations helps to prepare them for the choices they will have to make once they are living independently.Going out with friends, dating, and working part-time jobs are several examples of ways foster children can build real-world experience.
You can also find teachable moments from your own life to help your child with problem-solving. For instance, let's say you feel like you are falling ill and don't want to get others sick at work. You might demonstrate to your foster child how to alert your employer as soon as possible by allowing him or her to listen in on your phone call. Then, he or she will understand what protocol to follow in the event this happens during their work experience.

, Most young adults have their family’s support when they move out, buy their first car, go to college, or reach other milestones. Foster children may find these changes much harder to navigate unless they have similar guidance from trustworthy adults.Help your foster child get signed up with a job search firm in your area. Show them how to build a resume and practice answering job interview questions together.
A social worker will usually help a foster child to find housing and employment, but there are other resources you can tell them about as well, such as the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.This program can help the foster child obtain valuable resources, such as education, employment, housing, and emotional support.

, The best goals are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.Goal-setting is essential for achievement and staying on track in life.By setting goals, foster children can prepare for their future and build the skills necessary to find a job or go to college. Sit down with your foster child and come up with a few SMART goals to work towards.


For example, your child may have the goal to ""Get into college."" Action steps that you come up with might be ""Get letters of recommendation,"" ""Turn in high school transcript,"" and ""Submit college applications by deadline.""

, Children who grow up in the foster care system are at high risk of becoming homeless, dropping out of high school, becoming pregnant at a young age, and being arrested.They are also more likely to have mental health problems such as depression or PTSD. Many develop substance abuse problems as a way of coping with the difficulties of their lives.Despite the statistics, many foster children become well-adjusted adults living productive lives. Encouraging these at-risk children to adopt good habits and to actively prepare for the future is an important factor in setting them up for success., Instilling good health habits, such as eating nutritious foods and getting enough physical activity, in children can help them maintain a well-balanced, healthy lifestyle into adulthood.


Model healthy behaviors at home. Because foster children are at an increased risk of engaging in risky sexual behaviors, catching STIs, and becoming parents at an early age, you can decrease this from happening by discussing safe sex measures and educating them about contraceptives. Also, emphasize the importance of regular STD screening to prevent or detect disease.In addition to safe sex education, help your child develop good mental and physical health strategies, such as eating less fast food and cooking at home, getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, and working out for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week. Encourage healthy stress-management as well by coming up with a list of tips they can try when they are feeling overwhelmed or stressed like reading a book or walking outside. Discourage alcohol and drugs as a form of coping.

, Having a stable support network of adults who can provide care and guidance is one of the biggest predictors of whether a foster child will successfully make the transition to independent living.Ideally, foster children should have some connection to their family members. Try to put them in touch with grandparents, aunts, uncles, or other older relatives, if possible.
Foster parents, case workers, pastors, teachers, and coaches can all be good role models for foster children.

, Your child needs to know what resources are out there and how to access them. Also, it's important to encourage them to reach out for help when they need it.


There are many local and national agencies and support groups for young adults who are aging out of the foster care system. Two such groups are the Foster Care Alumni of Americaand the National Independent Living Association .

It's best to avoid bribing your child, but having rewards and punishments in place can help instill a sense of duty and obligation in your child.Be absolutely clear with what you want your child to accomplish.
Use specific means of measurement, like getting a B or higher on a test or finishing all of his/her homework or chores by a certain time.
Set clear consequences that will take effect if your child doesn't do what's expected of him or her. For example, you might take away TV and/or internet privileges or suspend your child's allowance for the week.
Enforce the rules with your children. If they don't do what's expected of them, they will need to learn that there will be consequences.
Your child will come to realize that getting things done feels good while not doing them leads to feeling bad, and your child will eventually learn to motivate himself or herself.
It's important to recognize when you're putting too much pressure or any unreasonable pressure on your child. If you show any kind of disappointment when they fail, for example, you're probably pushing your children too hard and making them feel tremendous pressure.
If you offer rewards as an incentive, make sure you're not offering physical prizes/treats. Instead, offer your child quality time together (perhaps through a day spent together at the park) or additional time at something he or she already has (like extra TV time).;
, Bribing kids may seem like a good idea, and it will get some results. However, it only motivates kids to earn a treat or prize, rather than instilling any kind of real work ethic or desire to help.Rewards only work for as long as the rewards keep coming, or as long as a parent/guardian is in the room to see the kid working.
Using rewards like physical treats (whether they're toys, snacks, or other ""prizes"") is not an effective long-term strategy, and it won't help your child develop his or her own self-motivating skills.
Positive reinforcement, like earning time to play video games or go out with friends, is more successful as a motivator than simple bribery.If you want to offer healthy, meaningful rewards, try offering quality time spent with one or both parents as a way to motivate your child.This type of positive reinforcement can help motivate your child while also avoiding a ""bribe""-based reward system.

, Value induction means explaining your values and imparting those values to your child. By teaching your child that he or she should do something for specific reasons (with long-term repercussions), it's much more likely that your child will end up being able to motivate himself or herself.Value induction has been proven to produce lasting effects in kids.
Once a child has learned a value system, that kid will be more likely to take up some or all of that value system and act out of real motivation.
Values can be as simple as, ""Education is the most important thing. Without an education, you won't be able to accomplish your dreams when you grow up.""
You can help your kid develop his/her own motivational value system by asking who or what that child wants to be when he/she grows up. You can then remind the child, ""If you want to be like ______, you need to finish your homework. ________ always put his homework and chores ahead of play time.""

, If you want your child to do something, you're probably going to have to do it yourself as well. This is true of work, cleaning, or finishing projects that have been started. Rather than leaving yourself open to accusations of ""it's not fair,"" show your child that you do the same things he/she does and find those activities rewarding.Many kids idolize adults. If your child sees you doing chores and you tell him how satisfying it is to have a clean house, he or she is more likely to help out.
If you're trying to lead by example with school work, take an active interest in your kid's education. You can also try taking a class at your local community college in something that interests you so that your kid will see you prioritizing education.

, Every kid has something they find interesting, weird, or cool. Most of those interests can be tied to some area of study (often science, especially for kids who like playing outside and catching things). As a parent, the best way you can encourage those interests is by learning about what your child finds interesting at the moment and encouraging your child to fully explore that topic.Ask your child from time to time what he or she is most interested in. Try to get beyond cartoons or toys to find out what subjects and ideas he or she finds most intriguing.
Explore your child's areas of interest together by visiting museums, planetariums, and/or wilderness areas.
Show interest and enthusiasm in the things your child gets excited about. For example, if your child is interested in stars, learn as much as you can about stars and buy your child a telescope or astronomy books geared towards kids.
If your child is interested in art, take trips to your local art galleries and buy your child drawing or painting supplies. This can get your child excited about existing art while giving your child the tools to make his or her own art.

, Learning extends beyond school. Your child brings home schoolwork and studies at home, but it's important to encourage other areas of interest as well. Whether your child is interested in reading, math, history, art, or something else entirely, make time and space at home for your child to explore those interests.Give your child as many books, magazines, and reading supplements as he or she can read.
Spend time reading, either together or separately in the same room. If your child is still struggling with reading on his/her own, help out and read a book together.
Help your child engage with different learning styles. For example, playing with blocks can help kids with sorting, sequencing, and problem solving, especially kids who have a more tactile learning style.
Be enthusiastic about the new things that you learn, and show your child that it's good to be excited about learning new things.

, Every child has areas that they excel in and areas they struggle with. This is normal, but as a parent you'll need to help motivate your child to do really well in both areas.Talk to your child about how you expect him or her to do well in school. Expecting your kids to perform well can help them succeed, while expecting them to perform poorly can lead a child to stop trying.
Ask your child for honest input on what subjects he or she feels come easiest in school, then ask about which subjects are the most difficult for your child.
Focus your greatest expectations on the subjects your child does well in, and give your child extra attention and study/homework help on the subjects your child struggles with.Sit down with your child to reassess his or her strengths and weaknesses every two to three months, and adjust your areas of expectation accordingly as your child's interests and strengths develop.

, Some children may feel like they can't ask a parent for help out of fear that it may come across as a sign of weakness. Avoid that pitfall altogether by taking an active role in your child's education and helping him/her out with difficult assignments before your child has to ask for your help.Help your child with homework every night, but be on the lookout for things that your child is struggling with more than others. Those subjects and activities will need the most guidance and instruction.
If your child isn't good at something, help out and provide instruction/guidance.
Kids might say they find something boring or dumb when they don't know how to do that activity. If your child says something along the lines of, ""Our homework assignment was dumb,"" you may need to offer extra help and guidance.

, Children need to know that they are loved no matter what happens. Some children may fear that doing poorly on a test will disappoint their parents. While you'll need to convey to your child that a poor grade is bad and needs more work, it's important to acknowledge your child's efforts, regardless of the outcome.Praise can help keep kids motivated, but if your child is struggling in school he or she may not be getting very good grades.
Rather than discouraging your kid for trying and failing, celebrate his or her efforts while also motivating your child to do better next time.
Take more of an active role if your child is struggling in school. Offer support and help your child work through difficult assignments.

, It's good for children to have things they're excited about. No matter what your child wants to explore, you should be supportive and encouraging as much as possible.


Some kids will want to take up musical instruments, while others may want to play sports. Some kids will want both, and some won't want either.
Find out what your child is interested in and encourage him/her to explore that interest.
If your child shows an interest in something, sign him or her up for lessons/classes, or (in the case of sports) try to enroll your child in a youth league for beginners.
You should also try to enjoy the things your child enjoys. Watch sports matches together, listen to music together, and go see live performances.

, Having specific goals makes it easier to motivate your child. No matter what hobbies your child is interested in, taking an active role should mean setting attainable goals for your child and pushing him/her to achieve those goals.Goals with specific outcomes can be more challenging (and therefore more engaging) than just general goals like practice times.
For example, instead of having your child practice a musical scale a certain number of times, give your child a concrete and challenging goal like practicing until he/she can play the first four or eight measures of a song without error.

, Your child doesn't necessarily need to get involved in sports (although if he or she wants to, you should encourage it). Kids do need plenty of exercise, though, as being physically active will help your child feel better, have a more positive outlook, and get a more restful night of sleep.Physical activity helps build strong muscles and bones while managing/preventing weight gain. These are results that your child can see and feel good about.
Most kids will get active if they're given the right tools. Take your child to the park or a playground, give him/her equipment to play ball with, and make it a fun activity that you can join in on (if your kid wants you to).Encourage your child to get active with his/her friends. Take them to the park to play ball together, run obstacles through the playground, etc.
Teach your child to ride a bike, using training wheels at first and gradually riding without them. This is a great form of exercise and can allow your child to ride to/from friends' houses and the park (as long as it's safe to ride a bike in your neighborhood).
Always have your child wear a helmet whenever riding a bike, and teach your child basic safety measures like wearing visible colors, staying out of traffic, and using hand signals to let others know when your child is stopping or turning.

, Most kids go through cycles of interest where something new and exciting takes the place of an older interest. This is natural, and it's normal. No matter what hobbies your child pursues, it's important to remember that the greatest thing in the world today may be old news in a few months - and that's okay.Don't discourage your child from exploring new interests, and don't force your child to keep participating in a hobby or sport he/she doesn't enjoy any longer.
It may be frustrating, especially if you spent a lot of money on instruments or equipment. For this reason, it may be best to rent equipment and instruments until your child knows it's something worth sticking with (especially with equipment, which your child will outgrow).
Remember that forcing your child to keep doing something he/she no longer enjoys will discourage your child from exploring interests and may make hobbies feel unfulfilling.

, Some children only do chores because it gets them an allowance. While you may choose to give your child an allowance, money alone shouldn't be the motivating factor. Explain to your child that you can't do everything by yourself, and that your child's help would give him/her some big, grown up responsibilities.Chores can help your child have a sense of purpose at home.
Chores can also let your kid feel like he or she is contributing to something bigger. Kids think of parents as running the household, but many kids love to play house - and chores let them actually help manage the home.

, Chore charts are a great way to track what needs to be done each week and which tasks have already been accomplished. You can find chore charts for free online to download and print, or simply make your own at home.Chore charts can help your child see the tasks you expect to be completed on a list, rather than just thinking about them in his or her mind.
As your child works through each task on the chore chart, have your child check them off or mark them complete with a sticker.
Checking off items on a list can bring a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, which is vital to your child's motivation in helping with chores.

, Chores may not be fun in and of themselves, but you can make chore time a fun family time together. Try to make your child see chore time as quality time with room for play and conversation (as long as the work gets done as well).Listening to music while you cook or clean together can turn chores into a fun dance party.
You and your child can pretend to be robots while you do certain chores, or reenact scenes from your child's favorite movies.
Using cleaning tools like a feather duster, spray bottle, or vacuum cleaner can be fun for kids because these tools are so foreign yet familiar (largely from cartoons and movies)., As you assign chores to your child, it's important to remember that a chore being finished by your child may not look the same as it would when finished by an adult. That's okay, and over time (through several years) your child will get better and more skilled at cleaning, cooking, and other household tasks. For the time being, though, make sure your expectations are reasonable and the workload is manageable for your child.Don't expect a perfect, sparkling home. Your children are still kids, not professional cleaners, and there are limits to what they're capable of.
Break chore time into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of having a consecutive hour of cleaning, for example, you might set a timer for 15 minutes of cleaning and take little breaks together between each chunk of time.

, Veering away from a predictable routine will help keep chores interesting and (hopefully) fun for your child. If you have multiple kids, you can alternate their chores. If you just have one kid, you can make him/her a new chore chart every two weeks or every month - that way your child will get used to changing assignments and get exposed to a wider range of tasks.Switching out tasks between multiple kids or between one kid and one parent can keep things interesting. If your child has to do the same chores every week it might get repetitive and stop being fun.
One way to switch out chores if you have more than one child would be to have each kid clean their sibling's room instead of their own. This may make older kids uncomfortable (especially if they value privacy), but for younger kids it can help change things up.
Don't be afraid to give kids some more difficult tasks. Many kids find these tasks fun, while easier chores are sometimes seen as being boring., Don't take your child's work for granted. It takes a lot more work for your child to finish all of the chores you assigned than it would take for you, and if you want your child to stay motivated you'll need to give him/her praise and some sense of accomplishment.Praise your kids when they finish their chores, and thank them for their work.
Let your child feel like part of the household by saying something like, ""Thank you for all your hard work. We're a good team, and I couldn't have done it without your help.""Do something fun with your kids when they finish all their chores.
You might try taking them out to see a movie, or going out for ice cream sundaes.
If your child hasn't finished the chores he or she was given, wait until those chores are completed. Don't let your child go to his/her room or play until the chore is complete, and withhold celebrations that week since your child didn't stay motivated.

Don’t contact them too much.,

Give the friendship time to grow.",How to Make People Want to Be Your Best Friend," People tend to flock to those who have a good sense of self-confidence. They often admire them and want to be around them. Project self-confidence to others, even if you don’t have much, and you’ll likely attract more friends.


The key to effective and attractive self-confidence is to not come off as cocky or self-centered. Simply walk with your back straight, shoulders back, and head held high. Look people in the eye and smile when you talk to them.Don't act like you're better than others by not speaking or ignoring them. Make everyone you meet feel like a million bucks.;
, As much as it can be funny to make yourself the subject of a good joke, don't take self-deprecating talk too far. People don't want to be around someone who always talks about themselves too much--whether it's positive or negative.


For example, don't let your social group catch you saying negative things like ""I'm fat"" or ""I look hideous."" People want to be around people who feel good about themselves because that type of self-confidence can be contagious.
Belittling yourself sends the message that you're secretly low in confidence. So, avoid such language at all costs., You can’t expect people to want to be your friend if you aren’t willing to put yourself out there. Strike up conversations with people whenever and wherever you can. You never know, you could find your new best friend in line at the grocery store.


Practice what you are going to say to someone when you are alone. You could talk about the weather, the local sports team, outlandish celebrity news, or whatever you like to talk about. Having a topic prepared can help you feel more confident when you try to talk with someone new., If you want to meet new people and potential best friends, you’ll need to engage in new experiences. You’re not going to meet anyone if you aren’t willing to try new things. Finding people who are interested in what you are is a great start at finding true friends.


Join groups or take classes that interest you. Doing so gives you a great chance of finding someone who enjoys the same things you do. You could also ask your friends and family if you could meet their friends, or talk to people who share the same religious beliefs as you do. Some of the most meaningful relationships start because of shared interests., Is there a certain personality or trait that you find attractive when you’re looking for friends? If so, take on that trait. This doesn’t mean you have to be fake--just try to incorporate some of that into how you act.


For instance, if you like people who go out of their way to care for others, then do that, as well. If you admire people who take risks, then start taking some of your own. Be spontaneous and step out of your comfort zone. You’ll likely not only find that you are happier, but that new friends will naturally be more attracted to you., A person isn't going to jump to be your best friend if you don't seem willing to put work into the friendship. Great best friends are there when you need them. Make sure you are there for the people around you and spend time with them when you can. Showing that you are truly interested in their happiness and well-being will make them see that you are a true friend.


This could mean sending texts to check in, bringing them soup when they aren’t feeling good, offering your time when they need help, and opening yourself up to them. It may make you feel vulnerable doing this, but it increases your chances of finding a best friend., People generally like to talk about themselves. This isn't done in an arrogant way--it's just how they best relate to others, through their own stories. Find out all you can about potential friends. Show interest in them by asking questions that get them talking.


Ask questions like, “What’s your favorite thing to do?” “Why did you choose this career path?” or “Who is the person who influences you most?” Asking different questions like this allows you to get to know them on a personal level and opens up the beginnings of a great friendship., It’s difficult to maintain a relationship with someone you don’t see. You also may make them feel like they aren’t worth your time if you don’t see them often. Do what you can to share your time with them and they will see that you think they are worth the effort.


Although going out and attending events together is fun, you don’t always have to do something. Just being in the same room together and chatting about what is going on with your life is often more fulfilling., Part of being a good friend is acting as a cheerleader. You have the ability to make others feel good about themselves, and this is something you should take on for your friend. When you are able to lift up their spirits and support them, they will likely be grateful to you and your friendship, which can allow it to become stronger., What makes a best friend stand out from other friends is your ability to share anything with them. Best friends have secrets that are kept between them. You can show your capacity to be a best friend by being honest with your friends and keeping their secrets.


If a friend tells you something, don't share it with anyone else. Unless, of course, your friend is in danger, you should keep your lips zipped.
Trustworthy people are also honest. If your friend asks you a serious question, tell the truth, even if it hurts. For instance, if a close pal asks, ""Do you think I should go to second-base with Josh?"" Show your concern by saying ""I think you should wait until you're sure he really cares about you."", When you’re just building the relationship, you don’t want to scare the person away by trying to make too much contact. Texting and calling several times a day may be overkill and could make the person resist wanting to be friends with you.


Initially, making contact every few days or when you want to do something together is ideal. Over time, you can reach out more, but only after you’ve been friends for a while.
A good rule of thumb is to follow the other person’s lead. Return texts or calls when they text or call you. If you don’t hear from them after a few days you can reach out, but only do it once. Bombarding them with texts and calls will just scare them away., If you’ve made the mistake of coming on too strong, you may be able to save your friendship by taking a step back. By giving the person space, you may make them more apt to being your friend.


If your calls and texts are unanswered, your invitations for spending time together are often declined, or you just have a feeling that something is going wrong, your friend may be backing away from you. You can ask them what happened, or you can try giving them space and see if that makes the friendship better., Just like every relationship, this friendship needs time to blossom. Don’t expect too much too soon. If you’ve found someone you feel you’ve made a connection with, you may want to jump at the chance of spending as much time together as possible. However, this may make your new friend shy away from you.


Take things slow and give your friendship a time to develop into something strong and long-lasting. "

, This will make it very easy to find rings instead of window shopping for rings that might be out of your price range. You will be surprised that the rings aren't that expensive, but there are some high-end ones as well. Decide whether you are going to splurge or go for a moderate price. Also, how will you wear the ring? Are you purchasing a chain to wear it on around your neck, or are you wearing it on your finger?

, If you have a ring that already fits your ring finger, you can print out a ring sizing chart and line it up with the right circle. If you can, try on the ring. Any jeweler or jewelry store will be able to help you size a ring.

, If you want, you can wear your ring on a necklace chain.

Show people respect.,
Develop a way to handle conflict maturely.,
Receive feedback positively.",How to Not Act Like a Child1," You should take responsibility for your actions, whether they are intentional or unintentional. It is a sign of maturity and respect for others. Everyone makes mistakes. Failing to accept responsibility may seem like a good idea at the time, but in the long term it will not benefit you.For example, if you accidentally back into your neighbor’s car when pulling out of your driveway, let them know by writing them a note or knocking on their door. Then, correct your mistake by submitting the claim to insurance or paying for the damage.;
, Respect your partner, family members, friends, and strangers. Children are often selfish and disrespectful. As you grow up and mature, you should understand the concept of respect and why it is important.

, When you are faced with a conflict, it is important to keep your emotions in check. Control your anger and avoid becoming belligerent. Take a deep breath, listen, and work through the conflict with the other individual.Give yourself time to cool down if you are really angry. This will prevent you from saying and doing things that you shouldn’t do in the heat of the moment.

, People learn and grow by receiving feedback and criticism from others. You should accept that you don’t know everything and that feedback from an expert is not meant to hurt you. It is meant to help you.For example, thoroughly read through your edits on your research paper. These edits will help improve your writing in the future.

, Impulsive decisions are made without planning or foresight for the consequences that will come as a result of that decision.

It can be hard to get enough sleep sometimes when your friends want to talk or hang out at night, but remember that it’s important to get enough sleep so that you can feel your best.

Of course you don’t want to miss out on hanging out with your friends, but don’t make it an every night thing.

It’s suggested that teens get 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.;
, Make sure you eat regularly and eat the right foods. This means staying away from loads of sugar and including a balance of carbohydrates, protein, fruits, and veggies every day. If you skip a meal or don’t eat enough, notice if this affects your mood. Make sure you’re eating regularly to avoid mood swings related to hunger.

A diet that is high in saturated fats and caloric levels may lead to depression.Those who consume more water, fiber, ascorbic acid, tryptophan, magnesium and selenium have better moods overall. Diets that are heavy on legumes, fruits and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, meet these criteria.Add folic acid, which can be found in leafy greens and beans., Caffeine can interrupt your sleep. It can also cause nervousness, anxiety, shakiness, and dehydration. If you experience moodiness frequently, remove caffeine and see if it helps. It may be that one thing that pushes you over the edge.The effects of caffeine are typically felt within five to 10 minutes and may last from one to five hours. Aftereffects may last for up to 24 hours.A strong dose of caffeine may lead to jitteriness, increased heart rate, irritability, and restlessness.A strong dose is between 150-400 mg. (A coffee contains roughly 150 mg per 12 oz.; an energy drink is in excess of 100 mg per 12 oz; a diet coke is around 46mg per 12oz (or one can).)If you do consume caffeine, try not to exceed 50-150 mg, or about one 12oz cup of coffee., Exercise can help you improve your mood, increase self-esteem, and improve sleep. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which help you get into a better mood and de-stress. Exercise is good for physical and emotional health.

It’s recommended that teens get one hour of exercise almost every day.Maybe you hate sports, but that doesn’t mean you can’t exercise. Walk the dog, jump on the trampoline, go in-line skating, or go dancing.

, Sometimes you may want to be left alone and avoid people altogether, and that’s okay. But it’s also important to spend time with friends. Maybe you have one friend you can tell everything to; talk to her and let her know how you’re feeling. Talk to a trusted adult, such as a parent, guidance counselor, or coach.

Talk to your best friend, or maybe say hello to your crush.

, Sometimes mood swings are just mood swings, while other times they can indicate a more serious disorder. If your mood swings are more intense than other girls', talk to a trusted adult about seeing a mental health professional to explore other causes.

If you’ve noticed other symptoms, such as racing thoughts, incoherence, disjointed thoughts, or periods of excessive energy, this can indicate symptoms of other more serious disorders. Talk to an adult and a mental health professional.

, If you’re feeling angry, this step is very important, and if you skip it, you may do some things that you may regret in the future. If you push on with a bad mood, you won’t be able to think clearly and you might lash out more often. If you are with someone else or a group of people, try to find a way to escape or excuse yourself; maybe leave to go to the bathroom.Once you’re alone, take some time to calm down. Count to 10 or take some deep breaths. Splash some water on your face. Focus on your senses and engaging with your environment, not just what you’re feeling.

, It’s long past time to put to rest the notion that crying is “for babies” and is inappropriate. Many people feel ashamed of crying, but it’s a totally natural and healthy release of emotions. There are actually some health benefits to shedding tears: hormones and toxins which build up during stress are released when you cry emotional tears.

Don’t hold back! Let yourself cry.

Maybe you feel embarrassed to cry in public. If this happens, excuse yourself to the bathroom or go outside.

, It can be easy to get into a downward spiral of negative thinking. Before you know it, these negative thoughts start affecting how you feel. Be on the lookout for these common negative thought patterns:

All-or-nothing thinking: Either you believe everything is perfect and wonderful, or everything is horrible and you hate life.

Jumping to conclusions: You “know” that things will turn out badly, or assume people are thinking negatively of you even if there is no concrete proof.

Catastrophizing: You blow the situation out of proportion and believe you can never show your face again or that life is ruined.

, If your thoughts are spiraling into ""Nobody likes me and I’m all alone,"" ""Everything sucks,"" and ""I’ll never be happy,"" try to catch yourself when you start falling into these traps. Stop and challenge these thoughts by testing whether or not they are really true. Having a positive outlook is associated with health and psychological benefits, such as lower rates of depression and distress and having a longer lifespan.

Take a moment and find new ways to re-think what goes through your mind as negative.

Look at the evidence. When you think ""Nobody likes me and I'm all alone,"" think about whether or not that is really true. The evidence ""for"" that statement might be that your best friend was really mean to you at lunch and you feel really alone. The evidence ""against"" that statement is that you have many other friends who care about, your parents and your family love you. Maybe your best friend's parents are getting divorced, and her behavior has absolutely nothing to do with you.
Stop negative thoughts such as ""everything sucks,"" and change them into positive thoughts. You can think, ""No, not everything sucks. Even though I feel really down right now, I know my chinchilla loves me, and I’m excited to see a movie later tonight.""

, Getting your feelings out on paper will help calm your stress and understand what is going on inside. Often, people will be confused by how they are feeling, and writing feelings down helps you know how to solve your problem(s).


While it can be helpful to write out confusing feelings, don’t make your journal all about negativity. Consider writing about a pleasant experience too, to move you closer to feeling more positive emotions., Becoming a teenager is hard work. As your body goes through lots of changes, hormones rewire your body (and emotions!) to want independence and social position. This means that you want to do things for yourself and not have people telling you what to do. It also means that you’re trying to find how you “fit in,” see where you belong, and how you are unique among your friends., Throughout the month, your hormone levels change. Surprisingly, this happens to boys too, but to a smaller degree. Sometimes, girls notice a week that makes them feel moody. Start tracking your periods to figure out if it’s related PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome). PMS happens about a week before your period, and can include changes in food cravings, mood swings, weight, and your desire for sex.Use a calendar or a smartphone app designed to track your period. You want to start tracking on the first day of your period. This can give you clues whether your mood swings are consistent with your period.
Cut salt, caffeine, and sugar to help with PMS symptoms. , This can be a breakup with a best friend or boyfriend, the loss of a family member or pet, or being a victim of violence or abuse. If you’ve noticed strong mood swings following a difficult or traumatic event, they may indicate a feeling of overwhelming stress.Figure out whether you can work through the event on your own or if you need to ask someone (like a trusted adult or therapist) for help.
If you have experienced trauma or abuse, you absolutely need the assistance of a professional to work through the trauma.

Learn how to actually wear a bra.",How to Know when You're Ready for a Bra," If you see these small breast buds, it’s time to get a first bra. Breast buds are small bumps that appear under each nipple. However, if a girl is feeling self conscious about her breasts, it might be time to get a bra - regardless of physical development.


You should feel some tenderness or soreness when breasts begin to bud. This is normal, and nothing to be concerned about. It just means you are starting to develop.Next, the nipples and areola (circle of skin around them) will get darker and bigger. Then the breasts will start to grow more, at first perhaps having a pointy shape.;
, The average age for a girl to start wearing a bra is age 11. Some girls need one by age 8, though, and some girls don’t need one until they are 14. Every girl is different!


Sometimes girls who aren’t really that developed ask to wear a bra because their friend is wearing one. They could start out by trying a training braYou could also start out by wearing a tank top under your shirts. Either way, you should not stress out about whether you are developing like other girls. Everyone moves at their own pace, and that's OK.

, Developing breast buds is just one of the many changes a girl will see in her body as she starts to enter puberty.


She might start to grow pubic hair. In some girls, pubic hair actually develops before breast buds appear.Puberty can cause a girl to gain some weight, especially in the belly area. The belly might look more rounded. This is a natural sign that a girl is starting to mature physically.
The girl also might start menstruating, although her periods might be very infrequent at first. All of these things are normal signs of puberty.

, Girls can wear a training bra/crop top type bra when the nipples start to protrude. These bras are a lot more comfortable, and they almost look like crop tops, so you might feel less embarrassed because they won't be as obvious.


You want to find a very comfortable bra for your first one. There’s no reason for a young girl to have a fancy or lacy bra. Training bras are usually simple, stretchy cotton bras without cups.A sports bra is another good idea for gym class or if you are in any team sport. Because sports bras are designed to be flatter in the cup area, and are very comfortable, they can be good choices for your first bra, even if you don’t play sports.

, If you have grown breast tissue beyond the buds, and if you measure an A cup or more, it’s time for a soft cup bra.Measure yourself or ask your mother to measure you every four weeks so you can figure out when you need a soft cup bra. These don’t push up or otherwise change the shape of the breasts, so they are appropriate for young girls and are also comfortable.
Underwire bras are also not a wise choice for a first bra; they provide more support for girls with very large breasts, and since you're just starting to develop, that's probably not needed.You can choose a bra that’s similar to your skin tone so that it doesn’t show through your shirt, if you want. Buying bras in different colors can help you match them to the shirt, so they don't show through (for example, you wouldn't want to wear a black bra with a white shirt unless you have darker skin)., A girl may need to learn things older women take for granted.


For example, a girl might need to know that you don't need to wear a bra at night. Some bras have padding, but others don't, and the padding is not necessary when a girl is just starting to develop.You can use a wash bag to protect the bra from damage during a washing cycle.
You can find first bra lines in many department stores and in many lingerie lines. This can be a good choice for a girl's first bra., For many girls, getting her first bra is a complicated experience. You might worry that you will be teased by boys or other girls if you are developing faster – or slower. Understand that these sensitive feelings are normal. Who knows? Your mother might bring it up to you first. Ask your mother or another adult for a book that explains puberty. Explain to her what is going on with your body.Be open about your feelings. Sometimes boys tease girls about bras. If this has happened to you, don't worry - it's common. But do tell an adult.Realize that women are beautiful no matter the size of their breasts. Girls might be worried if their breasts are small or teased if they are big. Realize that women come in all shapes and sizes.Don't worry if you feel embarrassed. Understand if you feel embarrassed that this is normal at your age.
If you are the parent of a girl, don’t discuss the topic with others – friends, siblings – in front of her.

, You want to make sure that you pick the right bra size so that you are comfortable and properly supported.


Bra size is broken down into two pieces: Chest size and cup size. The chest size is an even number, such as 32, 34, 36 and so on. The cup sizes are in letters, like A, B, or C. In other countries, like the UK cup sizes can be different (AA, A, B, C, D, DD, etc.)A saleswoman at a department store will measure you for a bra, or you can do it at home or ask your mother or older sister for help. Use a tape measure. To determine chest size, run the tape measure under the breasts and around the back. Hold it firm, but not too tight. The measurement will be in inches. Add 5 inches to that number. This is your chest size. For cup size, loop the tape measure firmly around your body at the fullest part of your breasts. Subtract your chest measurement from that figure. The remaining number should be between 1 inch and 4 inches. This is how you determine cup size.
Less than 1 inch is a AA bra cup size. 1 inch is an A, 2 inches a B, 3 inches a C and 4 inches a D. If you end up with an odd number, round up to the next even number. This is especially important with young girls because they are growing so fast that if you round down they won’t fit in the bra long if at all. Girls are usually ready for a bra when they have an A cup. , Don’t be embarrassed if you need to tell your mother you have no idea how to wear a bra. Many girls need to be shown how to do this, and it's OK to ask.


To put on a bra, put your arms through the bra straps and lean forward so the breasts fall into the cups. Fasten the back in the middle hook (training and sports bras don’t have anything to fasten, which also make them good choices for a very first bra.)
Adjust the straps if necessary and refasten the back of it on a different clip to change the size.
You could ask your mother to take you to a department store and get you measured and fitted for your first bra.Some mothers try to make it a fun mother-and-daughter day.

But puberty, which is when you start making the change from child to adult, starts long before this step and can take years.Puberty usually comes with the development of body hair and changes to the following:


Body shape
Breasts
Your mind and thought patterns.;
, In most girls, puberty begins at about age 8 when her body releases a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).This tells your body to start the process of puberty, though it may take a while for you to start seeing physical or mental changes.Be aware that most girls will go through puberty between the ages of 8 and 13 and that it will end by about age 14. After the release of the GnRH, the first sign is usually developing breast buds, followed by sprouting body hair. You will usually get your period about two years after you first notice breast buds.
Understand that there is nothing wrong in watching your body for signs of puberty. This may help prepare you to handle the changes you are about to experience.

, There is a wide age range that girls go through puberty. Every girl’s body is different and physical factors such as genetics or weight can affect when you start puberty. Understanding these factors may help you better anticipate when you’ll experience each phase of puberty. Some of the factors that may alter puberty for you are:


Race. African-American girls often reach puberty earlier than Caucasian, or white, girls.Weight. If you weigh more, you are more likely to go through puberty at an earlier age.
Social factors. The lack of an adult male figure, mother-daughter relationship, living in a stressful home environment, can make a girl go through puberty more quickly. In addition, some people think that exposure to overt sexuality in the media may contribute to early puberty in girls.Age of female relatives starting puberty. Most girls start puberty at around the same age as their mother, sisters, grandmother, or aunts., If you are concerned about your development, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She can examine you and figure out if you are developing normally and when you might expect to see the signs of puberty on your body.


Ask your doctor any questions you might have about the stages of puberty or your personal development. Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed to talk to your doctor about your body.

, The first place most girls notice the physical signs of puberty is on the breasts. This process, which is also called thelarche, usually happens around the age of 9 or 10. You may recognize “breast buds” that are a nickel-sized lump under each breast.Look at your chest and feel your breasts gently with your hands and fingers. Breast buds feel like a small, firm, and tender lump in your breasts.Don’t worry about checking your breasts by hand or if you feel something. It’s completely normal to explore your body as you develop and beyond. Although you may wonder if the bud is a cyst, tumor, or abscess, it likely isn’t and you can rest assured that you’re starting puberty.However, if you have a lump in your breast that is very painful, red, warm, or has a discharge, tell your parents so that they can take you to see your doctor.
Be aware that one breast or bud may develop more quickly than the other. This is also something that is completely normal.
Consider a bra if your breasts are sensitive or you feel more comfortable wearing one. This isn’t necessary at this stage of your development, but it may be exciting.
Continue checking your breasts as you like. You may notice that your breast tissue gets bigger and less firm over the next couple of years., The second sign that you may be starting puberty is pubarche or growing pubic hair on your labia, which is the fold of skin surrounding your vagina. In some cases, you might have pubic hair before breast buds, but either is usually a clear way to tell that you’re starting puberty.Examine your pubic area, which is around your vagina, using your hands and fingers for signs of hair. You may not have much hair and it may be straight and soft. As you get older, the hair will become thicker, darker, coarser, and curlier. It will also grow up your abdomen and to your inner thighs in a triangle shape.Remember that you are not doing anything wrong by exploring your vagina or labia for pubic hair., Puberty means you’re gradually becoming a woman and taking on the shape of one. In addition to breast buds, you may notice that your shape changes, too.Look for changes to these other parts of your body, which often includes getting rounder or slightly bigger:


Hips
Thighs
Arms
Legs
Hands
Feet, About two years after you start growing pubic hair, you will probably notice hair growing under your arms as well.Watch for similar growth patterns of armpit hair as you did with pubic hair: it may be sparse and soft at first and then gradually get thicker, darker, and more coarse.Depending on your comfort level, you may or may not want to start shaving your armpit hair, which can encourage bacteria growth and body odor. You may also want to consider wearing deodorant once you start developing armpit hair to prevent body odor., Within the first two years of developing breast buds, you will likely go through menarche, or getting your first period.But about six months before this happens, you will likely notice that you have an increased amount of clear vaginal discharge.Check your underwear for signs of the discharge. Having discharge is completely common and normal, unless it has a heavy odor or itches. In these cases, see a doctor.

, For many girls, getting their period is most anticipated step of puberty and usually happens anywhere between the ages of 9 and 16.Once you notice vaginal discharge, expect your period to start within six months.Be aware that it’s common for your period, or menstrual cycle, to be irregular for the first couple of years after your first menstruate. Keeping track of your period on a calendar may help you figure out your personal schedule.
Get the supplies you need to handle your periods. You may want to wear pads or tampons or may just need a liner.
Realize that you may feel discomfort such as cramps, backaches, or headaches before and during your period. You may also experience bloating because of hormonal changes. In many cases, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to deal with any discomfort.

, Most teens will get breakouts of pimples or even acne. This is a result of extra sebum, or oil, production that happens during puberty.Wash your face with a mild soap or cleanser to get rid of excess sebum and reduce breakouts.
Ask your doctor about over-the-counter or prescription medications if your breakouts are severe. It’s completely common to have acne during puberty, but because it’s often an emotional time, breakouts may make problems or feelings worse.

, At some point during puberty, you will experience a growth spurt that will last two to three years. During this time, you may grow more than four inches in a year!You may also gain some weight and notice other changes in your body's shape, such as a curvier figure and wider hips.

, Puberty causes more hormones to gush through your system. These can affect your brain and change your emotions and thoughts. If you notice that your emotions, thoughts, and feelings are different or changing, it is a good sign that you are starting puberty.If you are feeling extreme mood changes or feelings of anxiety or depression, then talk to your parents or doctor. Some emotional changes you may experience are:


Feeling sensitive about your body’s changes or to other things like criticism or teasing
Having much more intense emotions such as being very jealous of another girl when you wouldn’t have been before
Going through frequent mood swings where you’re up one minute and down the next.Experiencing body image issues
Having less self-esteem or less self-confidence
Feeling anxiety or even depression., In addition to emotions, your brain is causing your thought patterns to develop and mature. Some of the following new thought patterns can indicate that you’re starting puberty:


Understanding more complex subjects or matters, such as the consequences of not doing homework
Making more of your own moral choices, such as knowing when it’s right to stand up for someone else who is being bullied.
Having a better sense of your likes and dislikes., Puberty means you’re growing into an adult, and you may find that you have a much better sense of yourself and who you are. Remember that these changes are normal, but may cause some confusion or anxiety. Give yourself a chance to have new experiences to see how they fit into your sense of self.Search for more independence by asking your parents to let you stay out later or go alone to the movies with friends. These can be key to helping you cope with puberty and grow up.
Recognize that your friends may change as you figure out who you are.
Make your own decisions as far as your parents will allow. For example, this might include picking out your own clothing every day.
Understand that conflict is any part of growing up and going through puberty. You may start noticing that you have conflicts with more people such as your parents and friends as you start puberty., You may also notice that you are curious about your body and sexuality as you start and continue to go through puberty. You may want to explore your body and might even masturbate sometimes, too. Both of these are completely normal, common, and nothing about which to be ashamed.Avoid believing myths about masturbation. It won’t make hair grow on your hands, cause you to go blind or develop emotional problems, and it won’t make you infertile.Ask a friend, family member, or medical professional about your feelings of interest about your body or masturbation. You may feel embarrassed, but remember that your feelings are totally normal.

, The ultimate reason every person goes through puberty is to prepare your body for reproduction. Since reproduction is often the product of sex, it’s normal to feel sexual attraction to another person.Consider dating if you feel attracted to someone and realize that because of your hormones, your feelings about the person may change overnight. Keep in mind the basis of a solid relationship are someone who supports, trusts, and appreciates you just as you are.
Talk to your parents, friends, family, or a medical professional if you have questions about attraction, dating, kissing, and even sex.If you are thinking about having sex, make sure that you talk to your parents, doctor, or another trusted adult to help guide you in your decision and make sure you are protected from pregnancy and diseases if you choose to have sex.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Keep a Menstrual Calendar," There are currently many different calendar options to track your cycle. You can choose to keep a physical calendar or journal or take advantage of any number of online tools or smartphone apps to track your menstrual cycle. Figure out which type best suits your needs and wishes.


Buy a paper calendar with plenty of space to make notes if you want to document your cycle by hand. You can get options small enough to fit in your purse or keep one in your office or home office. Consider using your smartphone calendar as well, though it may be difficult with these to see overall patterns in your cycle.
Choose an online tracker or smartphone app if you prefer to track your cycle electronically. Many sites such as Strawberry Pal and LadyTimer have free online tools that track your cycle and are compatible with smartphones. They offer a wide range of services based on your needs including period tracking and prediction, ovulation forecasts, file sharing with your doctor, and birth control pill reminders.Because you don’t have to write anything and there are so many different factors you can track, an electronic option may help you save time and more easily call up necessary information. In addition, online tools can import and export information into other calendars.;
, You’ll need to remember to update your calendar every day. No matter what format calendar you choose, the paper version, online tool or smartphone app should be easily accessible to you at any time.Place your calendar somewhere where you won’t forget to make daily notes. If you are easily embarrassed, consider putting your calendar in a place where no one will see it, such as your handbag or home office. Avoid places like your office because you may not be able to update your calendar from there on weekends, holidays and days you are sick.

, Remember that keeping your calendar can give you and your doctor important information about your cycle such as how long your cycle is, if it is irregular, as well as when, and if, you are ovulating.It can also cue you and your doctor factors that may cause irregular cycles. For this reason, it’s important to record anything that happens during your cycle on a daily basis.Consider updating your calendar at the same time every day so it becomes a routine. Set an alert or alarm on your smartphone or other electronic device if you find that you forget to update your calendar. Many apps will automatically remind you every day to update your cycle calendar. If you prefer a non-electronic method, consider wearing a bracelet with 30 beads that you can remove. Take off a bead each day that you update your calendar as a reminder., You may want to predict your period using your calendar. Most apps and online tools will mark your electronic calendar with predicted days that you’ll have your period based on earlier cycle patterns.You can also manually predict your periods if you’re using a handwritten calendar. Consider marking the calendar with a sign for predicted dates.


Make sure to save your data every day to get the most accurate predictions for your period and ovulation with online tools and smartphone apps. The more data you have, the better the tool can predict when your next period is.Figure out when your next period is by counting 28 days, which is the average between period, from your last period. The more data you write or store, the more accurately you can predict how long your cycle is and when you can expect your next period—or even ovulation. Your cycle may be anywhere from 21 to 35 days., When you go to the doctor, you’ll often hear the question “when was the first day of your last period?” The first day of your period is considered to be the starting point of your new cycle. Knowing this date can help you and your doctor figure out a lot of different types of information including the length of your cycle or when you are most fertile.Make sure to write down the first day of your period as soon as it starts.

, A paper calendar and online or smartphone period calendar generally allow space to write any symptoms you’re experiencing. Your notes can be as in-depth as you like. For example, you could simply mark the first day of your period with a red dot on the date. If you want to be more detailed, you could write, “Period started today. Feeling bloated and lethargic and have terrible back and abdominal cramps.”Remember that the more detailed your notes are, the more you may be able to discern important patterns in your cycle. If you are embarrassed or pressed for time, use symbols to represent the days you menstruate, if your flow is heavy, or even when you ovulate.
Note factors that may seem irrelevant to you like how heavy your flow is or if only have vaginal discharge. Even if you are only spotting, make sure to write this on the calendar. Include any other physical or emotional symptoms you have such as food cravings or frequent crying. All of these can help you know what to expect every month and can clue in your doctor about any irregularities you may be experiencing., Just as marking the first day of your period is important, so is keeping track of how long you menstruate. This can cue you or your doctor into whether your cycle is normal length. It can also help you to take enough supplies with you if you are going away.Make a note every day you menstruate. For example, if you have your period between the days of the 15th and the 21st in the month of August, you would make some kind of mark on your calendar on the sections the calendar has labeled for August 15th all the way through August 21st.
Leave the days you miss or skip your menstruation unmarked. For example, if you started your period on the 15th of August and you finished your period on the 21st of August, but had no bleeding on August 18th, leave that date blank on your calendar.
Remember to record any additional information you want including your mood, and flow rate, and other changes in things like color and texture.

, Many women use menstrual calendars to track ovulation and changes in cervical mucous. This can either promote or prevent pregnancy as well as hint at potential problems. But recording your cycle daily can also clue you in to when to expect the symptoms of PMS, or when to have sex, as well as other possible changes your body might have.Record any physical and emotional symptoms you have every day. Remember it doesn’t need to be anything in-depth. You could write, “Thicker discharge today and smells a bit fishy. Feel great otherwise,” or “no physical symptoms but feeling aggressive.”

, The only way to figure out patterns in your cycle is to keep track of it over the course of months or years either in your period journal or online tool. This can help you predict everything from PMS to your period and when to use extra birth control.Keep the calendar for at least six months. This is generally enough time to discern specific patterns in your cycle.

, Every three months or so, examine the data you’ve collected on your calendar or upload it to a spreadsheet or word document. This can help you and your healthcare provider more effectively detect patterns and potential problems in your cycle as well as help promote or prevent pregnancy.


Send any relevant information to your doctor if you’re using a smartphone app or online tool.Convert a handwritten calendar or journal to a word document or spreadsheet, you can easily search the data and send it to your doctor as well.

, After a few months, you should be able to see distinct patterns in your cycle. Not only can this help you anticipate your period, but may help your doctor figure out if you have any reproductive issues. Let your doctor know about any patterns you notice and make sure to ask questions if you have them.


Make note of any irregularities in your cycle. If you miss a month, or you skip a lot of days then talk to your doctor at your next visit.
Consider using an online tool or app such as Clue to help you detect patterns in your cycle. In many cases, you can use detection apps as cycle trackers as well.Check your calendar if you are planning a big event like your wedding or a vacation. For example, if you get your period between the 15th and 20th of every month, you might want to skip planning anything big these days and even before to avoid ruining something with PMS.

, The mucous in a woman’s cervix has a different consistency depending on where she is in her cycle. Watching for these changes in your cervical mucous consistency can help you predict at which point in your menstrual cycle you’re ovulating or even give your doctor important clues about your cycle and reproductive health. Make sure to note the changes on your calendar to more effectively predict when you might ovulate so that you can promote or prevent pregnancy.Examine any cervical mucous in your underpants or by inserting your fingers in your vagina. Remember that you aren’t doing anything wrong and have nothing about which to be ashamed.
Look at the color and consistently of the mucous. You may also want to note if there is any odor, which can signal an infection. If you are about to ovulate, you will have more cervical mucous and it will be thin and slippery. This usually happens about 5 to 8 days after your period. Be aware that you are most fertile during this time and should either have sex or use protection if you’re trying to avoid a pregnancy.If you’re done ovulating, you will have less cervical mucous and it will be thicker and less noticeable. This cycle of cervical mucous usually lasts for two weeks, Most women’s menstrual cycles average a standard time of between 26 and 32 days. Using the Standard Days Method by drawing upon the information on your calendar can help you predict when you’ll ovulate.Remember that you need to be very diligent in recording your cycle to use this method. Online tools and apps may also predict or figure out the most likely days you’re ovulating as a part of tracking your cycle. You will likely ovulate between day 8 and day 19 of your menstrual cycle. The first day of your period marks the first day of your cycle. If you’re trying to get pregnant, consider having sex more often during these days. If not, use extra protection or avoid sex during your most fertile period., A woman’s temperature while resting, or basal body temperature, will generally increase a bit when she ovulates. Taking your temperature every day as a part of your menstrual calendar can alert you to when you are ovulating.Record your basal body temperature in your calendar or online app every day. Look for your basal temperature to increase of 0.5 to 1 degree Fahrenheit, a factor to which many apps will alert you. If your temperature seems slightly high, this could mean you’re ovulating. You may want to have intercourse more often when your temperature rises if you’re trying to get pregnant. If you’re trying to prevent pregnancy, consider abstaining or using extra protection.

, Depending on the type of calendar you are using to track your cycle, you may be able to figure out ovulation simply by looking at an app on your device. In some cases, the app might even alert you to days that you are ovulating.


Be aware that you can get apps specifically for ovulation in addition to your menstrual calendar. Consider getting an app that integrates both a menstrual and ovulation calendar.

, No matter what way you are tracking your ovulation, make sure to record your results every day on your menstrual calendar. This can help you anticipate when you should have sex, abstain from it, or just use more protection. It may also alert you to potential issues you may be having with ovulation. If this is the case, make sure to consult your doctor.

, Doctors have patients track their cycles for different reasons such as that they’re trying to get pregnant, figure out cycle length and symptoms, or even detect problems. If you have any concerns while tracking your cycle, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist. He or she may suggest tracking other symptoms or elements of your cycle and then sending them on a regular basis to him or her. These can cue your doctor into potential problems or irregularities and help him or her formulate a treatment plan for them.


Remember that it’s important to be as honest as possible when keeping your calendar and reporting to your doctor. You don’t have anything about which to be embarrassed and even the most seemingly irrelevant information may be important to your doctor.

Be prepared to provide accurate information.",How to Talk to Your Teen About Sex1," Some people find it very difficult to talk to their teenager about sex. It can feel uncomfortable and awkward. If you are well-prepared for this important talk, you'll feel more confident and comfortable.Write down your main points. Spend some time thinking about what you really want to convey during this talk.
Do you want to include information about safe sex? Write it down. Do you want to make sure your teen knows where to get birth control? Write it down.
Take time to practice. Go over your notes with a friend or in front of your bathroom mirror.
It's up to you when to talk to your teen about sex. If they start asking questions at an early age, go ahead and answer. If your teen doesn't seem interested, you can wait until they are a little older. Going through puberty is generally a good indicator that they are ready to learn.;
, It's definitely helpful to plan ahead for this important discussion. While you can't know exactly how your teen will respond, you can try to anticipate certain reactions. Be ready to answer questions, as your teen might have several.Your teen might ask, ""How will I know if I'm ready to have sex?"" You can explain that there is no rush, and that there are lots of other ways to be intimate.
Another common question is, ""What if I'm being pressured to have sex?"" You might want to say something like, ""No one has the right to pressure you. You are in charge of your own body and you can make your own choices.""
Many teens will use this opportunity to discuss sexuality. It is common for a teen to ask, ""What if I think I'm gay?"" In this case, let your teen know that you love them unconditionally and offer to help them sort through their feelings.

, For many people, sex is intertwined with religion or other personal values. When you talk to your child about sex, you should include a discussion of both facts and beliefs. Talk about each, and differentiate between the two.Make your personal values clear. For example, if you believe in waiting until marriage for sex, say that clearly to your teen.
You should also be pragmatic and realize your teen might have different values. You can say, ""I would prefer that you wait until you are married. But if you have other ideas, please know that I am always willing to listen to you.""
You can explain that many people have certain beliefs about sex. Be clear that there are differences between community beliefs, such as those at church, and scientific facts.
For example, maybe your faith prohibits the use of birth control. You can still explain the facts behind the science.
Try not to preach. You can make your point of view clear, but still say, ""I'm happy to listen to you and answer questions.""

, When you are figuring out what you want to say, make sure to include some facts about the physical aspects of sex. For example, depending on your teen's age and knowledge, you might want to explain the mechanics of intercourse. It's okay to start by saying, ""Can you tell me what you already know?""Discuss the male and female reproductive systems. You can say, ""Do you mind if I take a few minutes to make sure you understand how pregnancy occurs?""
Be frank. Use the proper names for body parts, and don't try to shy away from discussing bodily functions.
Talk about STIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections). Make sure that your teen is aware of the physical risks of unprotected sex, such as HIV and chlamydia.

, When you talk to your teen about sex, it's a good idea to discuss the emotional aspects of having sex. Becoming sexually active can cause a lot of new feelings for your teen. Plan to discuss emotional changes.You can explain to your teen that sex is a very intimate experience. They might start to feel deeper feelings for their partner.
Make sure your teen understands the important aspects of a healthy relationship. For example, the person they date should make them feel good about themselves and show them respect and kindness.
Discuss unintended emotional consequences. Make sure your teen understands rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse.

, You want your teen to come away from this talk with a clear understanding of sex. Make sure that the facts you provide are accurate. If you don't know something, take time to look it up before your talk.It's okay if you don't know every possible form of birth control. But you want your teen to have as much information as possible, right? Take some time to explore the Planned Parenthood website and learn something new.Your teen might ask a question that you don't know the answer to. That's fine, you can't possibly know everything. If that happens, just say, ""I don't know, but I'm happy to help you find the answer.""

Actively listen.,
Be honest.,
Have a follow-up discussion.",How to Talk to Your Teen About Sex2," Remember that the goal is to talk to your teen about sex. This means that you should have a discussion, not give a lecture. Pick a time that is convenient for both of you to talk.Many parents find that the car is a good place to have an important conversation with their teen. You can concentrate on talking with minimal distractions.
Find a teachable moment. A good way to start a conversation is to have it occur organically. Bring up the topic when there is a natural opening.For example, maybe you are watching tv together and the story line involves teenage sex. You can turn to your teen and say, ""Is that something you've been thinking about?""
Or maybe you have a relative who recently had a baby. You can ask your teen if they have any questions about pregnancy.

, You and your teen might have very different opinions about sex. It is okay to voice your beliefs. However, it is also important to demonstrate that you are open-minded.You can tell your teen that you will not judge them. Try saying, ""I'm not here to judge you, I'm just here to listen.""
You can also try to look at things from a different perspective. Think of your teen as an individual, and help them make their own choices.
You can try saying, ""I've never thought of that before. What makes you feel that way?""

, A good conversation will occur when both you and your teen are active participants. Give your teen plenty of opportunities to express their feelings and ask questions. Show your teen that you are listening.Pay attention. It's easy to become distracted by trying to fix dinner or answer an e-mail, but give your teen your full attention.

, Talking about sex with your teen can be delicate. You want to keep your teen safe. Remember that the best way to do that is by being honest.Maybe you want to tell your teen to wait until marriage for sex. A natural question from them might be, ""Did you wait?""
Give a truthful response. You can say, ""No, I didn't, but I wish that I would have.""
Don't try to scare your teen with made up facts. For example, don't tell them inaccurate facts about how STDs are transmitted. Remember that accurate information is the best way to keep them safe.

, Keeping the lines of communication open. Let your teen know that they can come talk to you about sex at anytime. This initial conversation does not have to answer all of the questions.You can try saying, ""I know that's a lot of information to handle. Let me know if any questions occur to you later.""
You can also say something like, ""I know things change, so feel free to come to me anytime you find yourself in a new situation.""
Try checking in a few days after the initial talk. You can say, ""Thanks for your honesty the other day. Is there anything else that you thought of that you want to know?""

Be supportive.",How to Talk to Your Teen About Sex3," Your teen might be initially hesitant to talk about sex with you. It's normal to encounter some reluctance. Just reassure your teen that you are there to help. You can also give them other information.If your teen is curious about a particular aspect of sex, you can try giving them a book to read. For example, there are several useful works on figuring out one's sexuality.

, Having a talk about sex with your teen might be difficult for you. It can be emotional and maybe even a little scary. Don't be afraid to ask for advice if you need it.Ask a close friend or family member to help you out. You can say, ""I really need some advice on how to talk to Adam about sex. Any ideas?""
You can also ask a pastor or rabbi. These people are skilled in helping families communicate.
Do some research. There are lots of books and websites available that can help you to figure out the right approach.

Clearly outline the boundaries in your house.For example, maybe you don't want your teen alone in your house with their boyfriend or girlfriend. You can make that clear.

Determine whether you need to raise your progesterone levels.,
Undergo a progesterone serum test.,
Purchase a progesterone cream.,
Apply the cream approximately 14 days before or after menstruation starts.,
Apply the cream twice a day, in a circular motion.,
Apply the cream to thin-skinned areas.,
Recognize the possible side effects when using progesterone cream.,
Know when to seek medical help.,
Recognize the symptoms of PMS.,
Be aware of what progesterone is used for.,
Understand how progesterone helps to ease symptom of PMS.,
Understand the other possible causes of low progesterone levels.",How to Use Progesterone Cream for PMS," There are several signs you should watch out for that indicate that your progesterone levels are low. Whenever progesterone is low, you will experience worsened symptoms of PMS such as bloating, cramping, fatigue, breast tenderness, and lower back pain.;
, If you're not sure whether you're experiencing PMS symptoms, you can undergo this blood test to get an accurate measurement of progesterone levels in your body. To perform this test, a sample of your blood is taken and tested. Normal progesterone levels are as follows:


Pre-ovulation: less than 1 ng/mL (nanogram per milliliter)
Mid-cycle: 5 to 20 ng/mL, Progesterone cream is available in local pharmacies and health food stores. When buying a progesterone cream, look for ""USP progesterone"" on the label.


This indicates that the progesterone cream is derived from a Mexican wild yam root that has been synthesized into a real human progesterone, which is most effective., You don’t need to apply the cream during menstruation, as PMS symptoms tend to subside once your period starts.


Additionally, once you start your period, progesterone levels in the body tend to rise to normal levels. Therefore, you should stop applying the cream during this time to avoid having excess progesterone in the body.

, Apply between 1/8 and 1/4 of a teaspoon of the cream twice daily - once in the morning and once in the afternoon. This is enough to achieve normal levels of progesterone in the body. , You should apply the progesterone cream to a single area of skin, where blood vessels are close to the surface. Since progesterone cream is fat-soluble, it is easily absorbed through the skin and blood vessels.


Examples of appropriate areas include: breasts, chest, neck, palm of the hands, inner arm, and face.
You should apply the cream to these areas on a rotating basis to prevent the skin from becoming irritated following repeated application of the cream.

, Side effects caused by progesterone cream rarely occur. However, in rare cases, using the cream excessively can produce side effects such as headaches, drowsiness, nausea and breast pain.Remember that the goal of using progesterone cream is to balance the hormones, not to raise the amount of progesterone in the body to abnormally high levels. Therefore, to avoid negative side effects, you should only apply the recommended amount of cream.
Another side effect of this cream is skin irritation brought on by repetitive application on the same area of skin, however this symptom can be managed by applying the cream to a different area of skin each day.

, If symptoms persists or become worse, seek medical help. Symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, severe nausea, persistent breast pain, or persistent skin irritation should not be ignored, so seek medical help right away.

, PMS occurs due to a hormonal imbalance in the body which affects a woman's physical and mental health. PMS symptoms become most pronounced when progesterone levels decrease and estrogen levels increase after ovulation. PMS may present as a variety of symptoms:


You may feel depressed, anxious or aggressive when suffering from PMS. You may experience changes in your appetite and hunger levels. You may suffer from insomnia or difficulty sleeping, resulting in poor concentration levels at work or school.
In terms of physical symptoms, you may experience headaches, abdominal cramping, bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea. You may develop acne, itchy skin or eczema. You may also suffer from joint pain and weight gain due to fluid retention.

, Progesterone is needed for the synthesis of other hormones in the body, such as testosterone, cortisol, and aldosterone. When progesterone levels decrease, the production of these other hormones also decreases, leading to hormonal imbalances within the body. These hormonal imbalance

, Progesterone has a direct connection with the neurotransmitters in the brain. Therefore, progesterone cream is most effective for treating the mental symptoms of PMS.


Progesterone cream works on the central nervous system to improve cognitive function. It also works as mood stabilizer.
Progesterone cream also has capability to restrict the inflammation or swelling associated with PMS, as it decreases the accumulation of water or fluid in the extracellular space.
Progesterone also works as a pain reliever and muscle relaxant. It therefore helps to relieve stomach cramps, as it decreases the painful contractions of the uterus.

, Aside from PMS, there are a couple of other possible causes of low progesterone levels, which may result in PSM-like symptoms. These are:


Stress: Emotional and physical stress converts progesterone into cortisol, which causes a deficiency of the hormone and the appearance of PMS-like symptoms.
Hypothyroidism: This condition alters the synthesis of progesterone and its secretion into the blood, causing a deficiency.

Learn how to identify and deal with your triggers.,
Gather information.",How to Improve Your Mental and Emotional Health1," In addition to traditional intelligence, everyone has what is known as ""emotional intelligence"" or EQ. EQ refers to how well you understand your emotions and actions. Figuring out your EQ is a great place to start if you are looking to improve your mental and emotional well being.You can find online assessment tools to help you figure out your results.
A mental health specialist can also help you determine your EQ. This will help you figure out which areas need the most improvement.
For example, maybe you'll learn that you are not great at acknowledging your emotions. That could give you a starting point for improvement.;
, Take some time to look at the big picture. Are there areas of your life where you know you could make improvements? Devote some of your attention to figuring out which of these areas is most important to you.One of your priorities might be developing a more positive relationship with your sister.
Another priority might be figuring out how to maintain a healthy work-life balance, good physical health, fulfilling relationships, and a satisfying spiritual life.Figuring out what you most want to improve can help you figure out the most productive path.

, After you have completed your self-assessment, you can clearly identify the areas you would like to focus on improving. Take time to set some clear, attainable goals. These can be both long term and short term goals.For example, maybe you will set a goal of meditating for 10 minutes every day. That is a short term goal.
You might say, ""I would like to feel more confident in my conflict resolution strategies by the end of the year."" That's more of a long term goal.
Write down your goals. This will help you solidify them and make you more likely to commit.

However, it is important to process your emotions. Processing your emotions is a multi-step process. This process includes:Sensing. This is when you notice the way you are feeling. There might be a physical sensation associated with this emotion. For example, you might feel sad and notice a feeling of heaviness or tightness in your chest.

Naming. This is when you apply a name to the emotion. For example, you might decide that what you are feeling is sadness.

Attributing. This is when you try to find the source of the emotion that you are having. For example, you might attribute a feeling of sadness to a bad day at work or a falling out with a friend.

Evaluating. This is when you think about how having the emotion makes you feel. For example, you might note that you feel angry for feeling sad or uncomfortable for feeling sad. This may be a result of your background or culture.

Acting. This is when you decide what you are going to do to express or cope with the emotion. For example, if you are feeling sad, then you might decide to write about it, go for a walk, call someone, or just sit and do nothing for a while.

, Everyone has different triggers. Yours might be certain people, situations, or places.To cope with your triggers, take some time to figure out what they are and develop plans for how to deal with them.


For example, you might note that you get anxious whenever you are around your sister, so she might be a trigger for you. Therefore, you might develop a plan to cope when you are around her, such as keeping to light topics of conversation, setting a time limit for your visits, or bringing a friend along to act as a source of support.

, Avoid the stigma that mental health issues are somehow not ""real"" problems. Your mental and emotional health is just as important as your physical health. Take some time to learn about the importance of your mental health.Head to the library. Look for some books about the value of taking good care of your mental health.

Take care of business.,
Be honest.,
Talk about therapy itself.,
Examine your feelings.,
Ask questions.,
Keep your focus inside the room.,
Reflect on your experience.,
Challenge yourself.,
Complete any homework assignments.,
Respect the boundaries.,
Figure out why you want therapy.,
Take your time and choose carefully.,
Consider your finances.,
Have a conversation.,
Speak up if it isn't working.",How to Have an Effective Session with a Therapist," It's best to get financial and any other logistical concerns out of the way before the session begins. This way you'll have a clear head without worrying about when to pay or anything else business related.

, You may want to censor yourself because you want your therapist to like you, but it's best to allow yourself to say whatever is on your mind. This will aid your therapist in helping you, since he or she will have a better gauge of where you're at and what needs to be addressed., If you're struggling to open up or having other problems, include your therapist in the discussion. It might feel uncomfortable for you to share with your therapist your impressions of how your therapy sessions are going. Even though it might feel awkward, remember your therapy sessions are a partnership. If you have concerns, unanswered questions, or if you have needs to address, you need to be honest with your therapist.


Among other things, therapy is a relationship for helping you learn to have better relationships. Good communication and opening up to your therapist will help you with other relationships in life.If you're stuck, simply tell your therapist ""I feel stuck."" He or she will probably ask you to elaborate. Go from there, based on your experience in the moment. Having a dialogue about what you're feeling is a great way to get unstuck.

, If you don't know what to say or what direction the therapy should go in, take a deep breath and ask yourself what you're feeling. You may realize that you're feeling stressed, anxious, sad, hopeful, unsure, or something else. Share this valuable information with your therapist, which will build trust as well as give you both a starting point., If your therapist gives you a diagnosis or uses some psychology jargon, ask him or her what it means. If you want feedback about the therapeutic relationship, ask your therapist how he or she feels about working with you. If you don't know how to incorporate what happens in therapy into your life, ask your therapist if he or she has any helpful suggestions. There are a lot of questions you can ask, and it's important for effective therapy to be active in the relationship., It's easy to want to vent about your life and get caught up in things outside your immediate control. This can be useful at times, but it's also extremely valuable to work within the room and the therapy relationship itself.


If you do bring up outside issues, look for ways that you can use these problems to identify how the situation made you feel, what you did in response, and how you can respond better in the future. For example, you might have felt angry because your husband didn't take the garbage out last night, and you might have lost your temper and yelled at him in response. You might be able to use this situation to decide on a better response, such as by taking a minute to calm down and then reminding him to take out the garbage in a calm voice.
It is okay to focus on your relationships with other people, but instead of focusing on something small, try to focus on the bigger issue. For example, you might wish your husband would help out more with the chores in the house without you having to ask him or that he would listen to you when are talking. Understanding that this is what you really want may help you and your therapist to think of ways that you could express this desire.

, In order to get the most out of therapy, it's important to reflect on what happens in each session. Journaling is a great way to get your thoughts in order. You may even come up with questions or remarks for your therapist during your next session.Write about how you felt during the session, how you feel while you are journaling, things you would like to say to your therapist, and any interesting dreams that you have, as a few examples.

, Therapy can be of great help, but it's important to transfer the things you learn there into the rest of your life. If you have social anxiety, talk to your therapist about trying something that makes you slightly uncomfortable, like going on a date or hanging out with a friend. Your therapist can help you formulate a plan of action, and then you can try it out on your own. This is a good example of how you can make the most of therapy. Don't forget to talk about how it went in your next session!, Your therapist may give you worksheets to do, ask you to record your dreams, or encourage you to go outside of your comfort zone in-between sessions. In order for your actual therapy to be as effective as possible, it's important to engage with these requests to the best of your ability. If you have trouble with any assigned homework, discuss it with your therapist in the session., Therapy can feel like friendship at times, but your therapist likely has a lot of clients and only so much energy. Your therapist may establish some ""ground rules"" about contact outside of therapy or business hours, but if your therapist doesn't, assume that you probably shouldn't text or call your therapist at 8 on a Friday evening, unless it's an emergency.

, It's important to have a clear picture of your struggles and personal goals before you seek out a therapist, so that you can most effectively communicate what you want from therapy. This will ensure that you find a therapist who is the best fit for you and your unique set of concerns.Do you want to learn to love yourself better? Do you want to learn how to cope with stress or anxiety? Are you feeling hopeless about where you are in your life? These are a few reasons you might want to go to therapy.

, In order for therapy to be effective, you need to have a good relationship with your therapist. The ""therapeutic alliance"" between the two of you is actually one of the most important elements of good, effective therapy.Use a website like http://www.psychologytoday.com to search for therapists in your area. Many times this website and others will have a short statement from the therapist as well as information about how they practice therapy. You can use this information to make a more informed decision and find a therapist you connect with.
Try to find an expert in your area of struggle. If you're an adult with anxiety, see if you can find someone who specializes in adults with anxiety., Not all therapists take insurance, and therapy can be expensive. If you have insurance, contact the therapist to see if he or she is in your network (or ask your insurance company). You may only have a small copay if the therapist in network. If you don't have insurance, talk to your therapist about a sliding scale, which will allow you to pay based on your income., During the first session, before you commit, have a conversation with the therapist about your struggles and goals. Ask the therapist what sort of therapy he or she does and how that relates to your struggles. This process will allow you get to know your therapist a little better and decide if he or she is the right fit., You may want to preserve the feelings of your therapist or you may be scared of leaving, but if you feel like therapy isn't working for you, be honest about it. The two of you can talk it through, and your therapist might even refer you to someone who would work better with you."

Irrigate your eye using an over-the-counter tear solution.Particularly for allergic conjunctivitis, you may need eye drops which contain antihistamines.,
Tailor your approach based on your doctor's recommendation.,
Check for worsening with any home treatment.,
Use precautions to limit the spread of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis.,
Avoid getting pink eye.",How to Care for Pink Eye," Before beginning treatment for pink eye, you should ensure that you actually have pink eye. There are some symptoms that are common to all types of pinkeye. These common symptoms include:


Gritty, crusty buildup in or around the eyes
Pain in the eyes
Blurred vision
Itching in the eyes
Redness
Increased tearing;
, Though there are commonalities in symptoms, the types of pink eye also present some symptoms that differ. The following are symptoms unique to bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis:


Bacterial pink eye usually produces a thicker, yellow-green discharge and can cause the eyelids to swell. The infection often starts with only one eye, but can spread to the other eye after several days.Viral pink eye can cause a more watery discharge.Allergic pink eye affects both eyes at once and is characterized by excessive itchy and watery eyes. Both eyelids may swell as well., If you are not sure whether your problem is pink eye, if you think you may have a foreign body in your eye, if you wear contact lenses regularly, or you have a history of serious eye infections, go see your doctor.


Your doctor will talk to you to determine when the symptoms began and find out if you have a history of allergies. She may also examine your eyes and may take a sample of puss or fluid for testing.
Although some conjunctivitis can resolve on its own, a doctor may prescribe oral antihistamines or eye drops to help control symptoms.

, Viral and bacterial cases of pink eye are treated in different ways. Knowing which you have is therefore vital to ensuring proper care. Your doctor should be able to tell you which kind you have; do not attempt to self-diagnose.

, If you regularly wear contact lenses, you need to stop wearing them and switch to glasses until your eyes have completely healed.Discard disposable contact lenses that may have been exposed to the pink eye infection, and sterilize any lens storage equipment. Ask your eye doctor about disinfecting extended use or hard contact lenses.

, Carefully blot the area dry using a clean washcloth; do not rub your eye with your hands.You can use either cold or warm compresses.If you believe that an allergy is causing your pink eye, it may be best to use a cold compress. If the pink eye is caused by an infection, a warm compress may help reduce swelling and redness.Infections can spread from eye to eye, so use caution when you are using a compress. Use a separate compress for each eye and be sure to wash your hands between applications. Use new compresses each time you clean your eyes.
Start from the inside of the eye (closest to the nose) and wipe outward. Use a different part of the compress for each wipe to minimize cross-contamination., These can be found over the counter or they can be prescribed by your doctor. Antihistamines will reduce the swelling that is your body's natural reaction to the virus, bacteria, or allergen.Be sure to use artificial tears, not a solution such as Visine that has other additives in it.

, Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are treated differently. Here are the main differences:


If you have viral conjunctivitis, wait for the pink eye to clear up on its own. No medicines are usually used to treat viral conjunctivitis. If the patient is a child, the child can usually return to school after a period of 3 to 5 days, or after symptoms have improved.
If you have bacterial conjunctivitis, take your prescription antibiotics. Antibiotics usually kill the bacteria within a couple days. If the patient is a child, the child can usually return to school 24 hours after s/he has been treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics for pink eye are usually administered in the form of an eye drop or cream., If you are trying to treat pink eye at home but it seems to get worse, go back to the doctor. It is possible for the cornea to be affected by the infection.Look for the following signs that your pink has worsened:


Vision worsens (and blinking doesn't make it better)
Pain in the eye increases
Sensitivity to light increases
Infection develops
Symptoms worsen or become more frequent.

, You can easily spread viral or bacterial conjunctivitis to other people or to your other eye if only one eye is infected. You can also re-infect yourself after your pink eye has cleared. To avoid this, take the following preventative measures:


Do not share towels, washcloths, or pillowcases with anyone until one week after the symptoms are completely gone.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.
Keep your hands away from your eyes as much as possible. If you do touch near your infected eye, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water immediately.
Change your pillowcase, washcloth and towel daily. Wash the dirty laundry in hot water with detergent.
Do not use contact lenses until all symptoms of pink eye are gone. Discard disposable contacts or clean your contacts thoroughly following your doctor’s instructions before using them again to avoid re-infection.
Don't use eye makeup until the condition has cleared. Throw away any eye makeup that you used within a few days of the onset of pink eye symptoms, and purchase new makeup after the condition has cleared.

, Avoiding pink eye can be difficult if the virus or bacteria is spreading, but there are tangible steps that you can take to minimize the risk of contracting the infection:Do not share eye makeup
Do not share contact lenses, containers, or solutions
Do not share eye medicine
Do not share towels, pillows, linens, or handkerchiefs
Wash hands frequently, especially after body-to-body contact with other people
Wear protective eyewear in the cold, heat, or wind to protect against irritation

Be understanding.,
Understand that families may need to be focused on making important decisions about funerals, memorial services, benefits, and a host of details.,
Respect their privacy.,
Allow them the privacy and space they need to get through what are going to be difficult days.

,
Think beyond flowers and food.,
Send a card.,
Simply express your condolences.,
Show your support.,
Attend a memorial service.,
Offer skills or services to help the family.",How to Offer Support to Families of Lost Soldiers," The surviving families are in tremendous shock in the immediate days and weeks following the death of their loved one.;
, The family may not be able to respond to you right away or express their appreciation for your thoughtfulness.

, Grieving families who have experienced the traumatic death of a loved one may need their family and close friends around them.

,, Often bereaved families will be overwhelmed by gifts of food and flowers. Consider making a contribution to a charity or memorial fund in honor of their loved one. Often families will specify a charity or organization that their loved one was involved with or supported, and find this type of donation particularly touching.

, A card can express your sympathies and be an important reminder to a grieving family of your care and concern.

, If you talk with a family member, say you are sorry for their loss, or say you want to offer your condolences. That's enough. Avoid saying things like ""I understand exactly how you feel,"" or ""It was his (or her) time,"" or ""He (or she) wouldn't want for you to be sad.""

, In many communities, a procession is held when a fallen service member's remains are brought home. Consider standing near the processional route to show your support for the family. Bring an American flag, carry a sign that expresses your feelings, and stand in respect to honor the sacrifice their loved one has made for our nation.

, If a memorial or funeral service is open to the public, consider attending. Your presence can be a valuable support to the family, which appreciates knowing that their loved one is being remembered by many. Some families may need to observe their funeral ceremonies in private. If that is the case, please respect their wishes and be with them in your thoughts and prayers.

, If you are a business person who can offer an in-kind donation to help the family that will help during the funeral process, such as limousine services, public relations assistance, or event management aid, consider donating your time and services.

When you disconnect from people and activities, it can increase feelings of loneliness and make you feel worse. Connect with friends and family regularly, especially face-to-face. You don’t have to talk about your feelings, but it can be helpful to be around people who support you.If you don’t have friends or family near you, participate in local social activities, volunteer, and make some new friends.;
, Feeling anxious can lead to avoidant thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.Many people who experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also feel emotionally numb as part of their symptoms.Additionally, depression can lead to numbness and loss of joy and interest in activities.If you feel your emotional numbness is a result of one of these problems, see a therapist about getting a diagnosis and treatment.


A diagnosis can help shed light on any other problems that may be occurring. Treatment can give you hope and help you feel more connected to your emotions.

, Numbness can stem from feeling depressed, anxious, or upset. A therapist can help you work through your emotions at an appropriate pace and not overwhelm you or hurt you. They may also help you gain a better understanding and perspective on past and current situations that are contributing to your emotional numbness. You can learn to identify and label your emotions and make sense of them.A therapist may have you try psychotherapy as well as other practices like meditation, self-hypnosis, focusing, and centering. These practices can help you relax, soothe yourself, and allow emotions to flow in a manageable manner.
Find a therapist by calling your insurance company or a local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a friend, family member, or physician.

, If you’re currently taking medications and feel like your emotional numbness may be a result of the medications, have a discussion with your physician. They might change your dose or switch you to a different medication. Your physician might ask you to make dietary or lifestyle changes as well.Let your physician know how you feel and that you think it might be related to the medication. Be specific in describing how you feel. For example, you might say, “Since taking the medication, I feel emotionally disconnected and don’t feel like I can connect with myself or other people.”

, You may feel numb because you don’t know how to identify how you feel, or you feel obligated to be a certain way, like always in a good mood. If you’re unsure how to identify your emotions, take cues from your body. Focus on identifying emotions that arise. For example, if you’re going into a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable, you might get ‘butterflies in your stomach’ or tension in your shoulders. Notice subtle changes in your thoughts and behaviors that might impact the way you feel.If you feel lonely, acknowledge that you feel lonely. Notice what this feels like in your body and how it affects your mood, thoughts, and behaviors.
If you’re purposefully closing your emotions out to protect yourself, don’t rush the process. This can overwhelm you and lead to panic.

, Once you’ve identified your emotions, learn to express your feelings in a positive way. Many people talk about their feelings to gain clarity and express their feelings, but this doesn’t have to be the only way. You might write, dance, play or listen to music, paint, or meditate as a way to express your emotions. Creative expression can help improve your health and well-being. Find a meaningful outlet to express whatever emotions arise.Let your emotions out instead of bottling them up or pretending they don’t exist.
If talking about your feelings helps, confide in a good friend or see a therapist.

, If you feel detached or disconnected, try to feel grounded in the present moment. Sit in a chair and feel your feet on the ground and your body against the chair. Feel your body and use your senses to feel connected. Lengthen your breathing and start to notice things around you.For example, start noticing how many things are blue or yellow. Listen closely for sounds and noises. Connect with the present moment.

, If you’re not comfortable talking about your feelings, writing can be an easier way to work through them. Use a journal to process and express your emotions. A journal provides a safe, nonjudgmental, and private way to express your thoughts and feelings.If you don’t know where to start, begin with prompts that require some thoughtful reflection or emotional component.

, You might feel like a part of you has left and you cannot connect with your own emotions. This can lead to feeling numb from both good and bad emotions.Do things that previously brought you happiness. For example, start to paint, jog, or play with your dog.


Even if you don’t want to do activities at first, try them. You might feel more connected once you start.

, Perhaps you feel like you’re in a rut and don’t know how to change your thoughts to support yourself emotionally. If your thoughts tend to be negative or you’re not sure how to make them more positive, start to challenge them. For example, ask yourself “Is this thought true? Are there other ways I could look at this situation? Am I jumping to conclusions?”Focus on making your thoughts more positive. Because your thoughts influence your emotions, having more positive thoughts can help you connect emotionally.

, If you feel overwhelmed and stressed, this can tax your body and emotions to the point where they feel numb. If stress is taking all of your body’s resources, you may feel depleted and not be able to connect in an emotional way.if you’re dealing with stress and need a positive way to cope with it, try daily yoga and meditation. You can also do other relaxing activities such as journaling, listening to or playing music, or taking a walk.Don’t turn to mind-numbing activities like watching television or playing video games to deal with stress. Cope with your stress in a positive way that enhances your life.

, Make a list of all the things you feel are fun, or creative things you’d like to do. Put your favorite activity at number one. This list could be anything you enjoy and would like to incorporate in your daily life, such as taking classes in knitting or crocheting, painting or drawing, inspirational journaling or writing, or going fishing, attending a community event, etc. Hang this list in a place where you will see it daily and start checking it off as you go along.

These creative and fun hobbies will help you relax and cope during times when you are having a hard time with emotions. They help you to remain active and avoid isolation, and some of them, such as painting, drawing, or writing can be used as a form of self expression to release pent up emotions.
Doing artistic or creative activities tells your mind that you are taking care of yourself. It allows you to safely process emotions you may be experiencing or have been suppressing. Share your creativity with those friends or family members whom you feel closest and most comfortable with.

, Don’t ignore what your body needs, even when you feel numb. You might lose your appetite or feel withdrawn from people or the world at large. Even so, pay attention to what your body needs. Eat a healthy diet and schedule regular meals. Get good quality sleep, about 7-9 hours each night. If you’re suddenly over-sleeping or under-sleeping, you might want to speak with a medical professional.Taking care of your body can help you stay on a path to recovery and encourage your body to heal.

, Some people use substances to escape their emotions or numb them out. If you want to use substances or alcohol to run away from your feelings or to numb yourself further, recognize that substances and alcohol do not help you cope positively and may leave you feeling worse instead of better.If you struggle with substances or alcohol addiction, seek help. Find a treatment center or work with a therapist.

Ask questions.,
Listen calmly and non-judgmentally.,
Focus on healing, not on shaming.,
Suggest a visit to a trusted physician.,
Involve your teenager.,
Be patient and persistent.",How to Persuade a Teenager to Receive Psychiatric Help1," Your child may be exhibiting symptoms that hide a root cause. Ask her how she is feeling, how she feels about school, how she feels about her friends. If your child is exhibiting signs of self harm, ask about them. Show that you are always willing to talk about difficult things.


Use ""I""-statements.""You"" statements, like ""You need help,"" can sound judgmental and shut your teen down.Try focusing on how you are feeling and what you notice.
Try saying ""I notice you've seemed down lately. Have you been feeling bad?"" or ""Are you feeling down? Would you be willing to talk about it with me?""
If your teenager isn't ready to talk, tell her you are there to talk when she is ready.;
, It can be extremely difficult to see your child in pain, and it can be especially hard to confront a problem your child has that you cannot personally solve. When and if your child confides in you about painful feelings or self-destructive behaviors, stay calm. Do not offer solutions. Instead, hear your child out without interruptions.If you offer too much advice or reassurance, your child may shut down. Listen without talking.
You can reassure your teen that you are listening and do not blame them. Say ""I don't blame you for feeling that way."", Don't tell your teenager that there is something wrong with her. Do not say ""you are crazy,"" ""you need help"" or ""you need a therapist."" Instead, tell your teenager you love her and that a doctor can help her get through a hard time. Treat your teenager's mental health issues as health issues, which they are.De-stigmatize therapy. Explain that it is an ordinary way of working through problems, that many people do it at some point in their lives.
Explain that therapy is not perpetual. It can go on for a long time if your child wants, but it can also take a few weeks or months and be targeted at specific goals.
De-stigmatize medication. Treat medications for mental health like medicine, a substance the doctor prescribes that can help balance your system.
Mention that more than one in ten US citizens take antidepressants, and countless others take anti-anxiety medication or other mood stabilizers., You might be tempted to immediately make an appointment with a therapist, but making a first visit to your child's doctor or pediatrician to discuss mental health could be less threatening for your child. Ask your child if she is willing to discuss depression, anxiety, or problems in school with a familiar doctor. Your child's doctor may be able to recommend an appropriate therapist, as well as help your child begin to understand what might be happening to her.For instance, your teenager's doctor might notice that your child is suffering from mood swings, and might wonder if bipolar disorder is emerging. In that case, the doctor might recommend you visit a psychiatrist, who can prescribe medication should the need arise.

, Do not surprise a teenager with an unannounced visit to a therapist or doctor. Cultivate a trusting collaboration on mental health care. Buy books for both of you to read about any issues your teenager is facing. Listen to her feedback when picking a therapist or a course of treatment.If you are driving to the appointment, let her drive you both.

, If your teenager initially refuses to visit a psychiatrist or other doctor, continue to discuss it with her. Your teenager may feel she has other ways of dealing with her bad feelings. Let her know that you support her efforts to live well, but that she should pursue them in combination with medical care. Research her possible conditions and bring her information, or leave it lying around the house.


If your teenager is in a crisis, persuasion may not be enough. In cases of psychosis or threatened or attempted suicide, bring your teenager to the emergency room, or call 911."

, If you cannot persuade your friend to seek help, you may be put in a difficult position. If your friend is suicidal, losing touch with reality, or engaging in harmful activities such as cutting, drug or alcohol abuse, binge eating, self-starvation, or unsafe sex, get help immediately. Even if you promised not to, tell a responsible adult. Talk to your parents for advice, or go directly to your friend's parent or guardian.If your friend's parent or guardian are untrustworthy, talk to a counselor at your school or to a trusted teacher.

Now you have learned how to insert and remove your scleral lens the correct ways.",How to Insert and Remove a Scleral Lens," If you drop the lens while standing, it can shatter.;
, The plunger you will use to insert the lens has a small hole in it. This hole can be used to get a sense of how you’re lining up the lens with your eye. You cannot see the hole if it is dark.

, It can wind up inside the lens, causing blurred vision.

, Pour out solution from lens case. Never reuse contact solution! Reusing solution can cause the contact to become dirty, causing blurry vision. Eye infections can also occur if solution is reused.

, Fill the lens up to the top with sterile saline solution. If you do not fill the lens up all the way, bubbles will form after insertion.

, Make sure it is not resting at a tilt.

, Hold the plunger, which is holding the lens with your left hand. For your left eye, use your left hand to hold your eyelids open, and use your right hand to hold the plunger.

, If your face is not parallel to the floor, the saline solution will spill out of the lens before it is inserted.

, You should see and feel the excess saline solution begin to drip out once the lens hits your eye. This is ok. Keep pushing until the saline solution ceases to drip out from the hole located at the bottom of the plunger.

,, If there are bubbles you will need to remove and reinsert the lens. Removing the lens is done with a similar, albeit smaller plunger.

, Congratulations! Now lets move on to removing your scleral lens.

, If you drop the lens from standing height it can shatter.

, Your makeup will get messed up upon insertion.

, You will use the same solution for this as you would to fill up your lens. Wetting the plunger helps it suction to the lens better.

, Do not let go of your eyelid until the lens is completely out of your eye. The lens is made out of hard material, and if you blink when only half of the lens is suctioned off, the hard edge is forced into your eye. This causes severe pain.

, Make sure you do not suction the plunger to the middle of the lens where it bulges out. Apply the plunger to the bottom half of the scleral lens. Use a mirror to make sure you are placing the plunger to the correct part of the scleral lens. Remember: once you make suction to the lens, the lens being removed from the eye is the only way to get the plunger and lens out of your eye. This is why it is very important to make sure you make contact with the correct part of the lens.

, Pressing too hard can make the suction too strong which makes removal painful.

, It helps to use a flicking motion with your wrist.

, Use a twisting motion so the lens does not crack. Never pull the lens straight off.

, Cleaning the lens gets it ready to be inserted the next day!

, It is important to follow these instructions so you avoid injuries and avoid accidentally breaking your lens. You did it, congratulations!

Identify signs of violence.,
Acknowledge the violence to begin addressing it.,
Break the cycle of violence to escape from harm.,
Tell someone that violence is occurring, to gather support.,
Create a plan of action to structure your response to the abuse.,
Protect your location.,
Take legal action.",How to Overcome Family Violence1," Some forms of violence are subtle, and you may not even realize that you are a victim of abuse if you have been dealing with it for a long time. If you suspect you might be a victim of family violence, but are unsure, see if any of the following scenarios sound like your current situation at home:


Being called names that are meant to put you down and make you feel poorly about yourself.
Being discouraged from participating in daily activities such as social events, school, or even work.
Being blocked from seeing friends and family.
Having a partner that acts highly jealous, verbally and even physically expressing their controlling feelings.
Having a partner who tries to maintain high levels of control over your life.
Having a partner who gets very angry or physical when drinking or using drugs.
Being physically harmed.
Being forced to have sexual interaction against your will.
Being blamed for violent behavior, and told that you deserve it.
Being threatened in any way, especially with a weapon.;
, The first step to addressing family violence is accepting the fact that it exists, so that you can face it appropriately.


Violent abuse comes in many forms, so it's important to recognize the signs of abuse to stop them early on.
Because abuse gets progressively worse over time, it can be essential to stop it as soon as possible.
Although abuse may begin with something somewhat innocuous like name-calling, it can easily progress to a singular physical event, and then develop into full-blown violent abuse occurring on a regular basis.

, Breaking the cycle is the first step you can take towards dismantling an endless pattern of violence and trauma.


If you are currently suffering from family violence, you may recognize this cycle:

You abuser threatens you, saying that they'll be violent with you.
They physically become violent.
They apologize.
The cycle repeats itself.


The cycle will get worse and worse, until your life or children's lives may be at risk.
The longer you stay, the worse your emotional and psychological state will become.
You may end up feeling helpless and depressed, so it's important that you stay strong, breaking the cycle before it escalates.

, The first step to breaking the cycle is telling someone about the violence that's occurring, to rally other people around you and gain reinforcement.


Seek help from someone you trust: a friend, family member, or healthcare professional.
Although it can be challenging to speak about the violence and abuse, you will instantly feel a sense of relief.
You now have someone on your side, looking out for your best interests.
Building a support system is the best thing that you can do for you and your children.

, Once you decide to break the cycle, you will need a plan of action.


Make a call to a loved one when your abuser isn't around, so that you're safe.
You can either make a call from a pay phone or a friends house.
If you do not know where to go, call a shelter. They will provide you with the information and support you need.
You will need to pack a bag that has some extra clothes, a bit of money, your medications, and anything else that you and your children may need.
Keep this bag in a secure place or pack before you leave.
You will need to know exactly where you're going before you do, because the last thing you want to do is leave without a plan.
If you don't plan properly and make a definite exit, you may end up back where the violence occurs and find that it gets worse, since you took action without your abuser's knowledge.

, In order to make sure that you can leave safely and won't be tracked down by your abuser, protect your location and ensure that you travel undercover.


Use your home phone and mobile cautiously. Your abuser may look into your phone records to see who you have contacted. This may give clues about where you and your children are located.
You want to avoid that violent environment and avoid being kidnapped or forced to come home.
Be careful online. Be careful which sites you look up at your home before leaving. If your abuser sees that you're contacting shelters, violent behavior can turn deadly. Clear your viewing history if you need to look up information from home.
Make sure there are no GPS devices in your car or attached to your phone. You do not want the abuser to track down your location.
Don't tell too many people about your location. If your abuser reaches out to mutual friends, they may find out where you have gone.

, It can be frightening to press charges, because you might fear for your life, but it can be a surefire way to avoid future violence and make sure that your abuser faces justice.


If you call the police, they will help you move forward.
If you want to press charges, you need to stay strong.
Without your co-operation, there may be a lack of evidence.
Some abusers will plead guilty, but others will continue onto court.
In this case, you will more than likely be called as a witness.
With the proper support, you can and will be able to go through with this process.
Legal measures are generally a good idea when children are involved, because you should gain custody of your children to ensure that they do not live in a high-risk environment.

Seek out counseling and mental health therapy to begin recovering.,
Look into narrative therapy.,
Maintain mindfulness to stay present in your life.,
There are various ways to incorporate mindfulness into your life, including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based stress reductions.,
Try out group therapy to empathize with others.,
Move on from the past to lead a healthy and happy life.,
Keep a journal to reflect on your progress.,
Continue seeking support.,
Reward yourself.,
Set goals to motivate yourself.",How to Overcome Family Violence2," There are many services available to help both you and your children work through the abuse, allowing you to fully heal.


If the issues surrounding your abuse are not discussed and resolved, you could wind up in another abusive relationship.
Although your abuser may be gone, the violence in your life could stay with you if your mental condition is not addressed properly.
There are various options in terms of counseling options, some of which are listed below.

, Narrative therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on you being the expert within your own life, rather than being told what to do by a therapist.


This approach thinks of problems as separate from the person themselves.
Narrative therapists focus on the skills, values, beliefs, and abilities that you have, in order to make change in your life.
This can help you re-discover your abilities, and provide you with hope for the future.

, Mindfulness focuses on experiencing the present moment in time.

,


Meditation is often incorporated into mindfulness therapy, in which you focus purely on the present.
This can help you move away from fearful or anxious thoughts and emotions.

, Group therapy is a great option to provide additional support during your recovery.


In group therapy, survivors share their stories with others, transforming their feelings of fear, shame, and guilt.
Although this is an effective experience for many, some prefer one-on-one therapy sessions.

, Moving on after an abusive relationship can be challenging and may take some time, but you can and will return to a normal, healthy life.


Many people find that being on their own can be challenging at first, but it will get easier with time.
You may need to look after children, go back to work, and re-adjust to normal life.
At first, you might not feel confident, and may have a hard time coping with daily tasks.
You may feel isolated, or may feel guilty for leaving your abuser.
Each case is different, but no matter what you feel, you are always better off outside of an abusive relationship.

Tell someone if you’re being threatened or bullied.,
Stick with your true friends.,
Disengage from drama.,
Prioritize your time.,
Reconsider any romantic relationships that are constantly up and down.",How to Overcome Problems at School or Home1," This is a serious issue that you shouldn’t have to hide from anyone. You won't get in trouble for informing others about how you are getting mistreated. You can also choose to walk away, and protect yourself if the bully is physically harming you.Talk to a guidance counselor or discipline officer at your school. Tell them how you feel and what has been done/said to you or about you.
Stand up for yourself. Don't let others push you around. Nobody can tell you who you are; that’s for only you to decide.
This includes cyberbullying. If you are being bullied over social media or via texting, direct messaging, emails with things like threats, pictures, spreading rumors, or verbal attacks, it's important that you talk to someone.Cyberbullying can be especially harmful because it can be done at any time, from almost anywhere. It can sometimes be difficult to track who is behind the bullying and undo damage done by images or messages once they have begun circulating.;
, If you keep fighting with some friends, or other friends keep asking to copy your homework, decide if these are friends you want in your life. Choose to keep the friends that care about you and that you care about back. The people that use you or pretend to be your friends? Forget them.


It can be hard to let friends go, but prioritize your happiness. If people contribute to your unhappiness, let them go.

, Drama can be fun, but it can also be very damaging. Don’t ever spread rumors about somebody. Think about how you would feel if people were spreading rumors about you. Don’t get involved with drama, and don’t participate in other people’s drama. If someone spreads rumors about you, tell an adult and speak up for yourself. Nobody has the right to treat you disrespectfully.Remember that bullying and spreading rumors can have devastating consequences for the person being bullied and to those participating in the bullying.
If two of your friends are fighting, tell them that the fight is between them, and you refuse to choose sides.

, Make sure your social relationships don’t take over all of your time, and remember to devote some energy to school and learning. Especially if you have career or college goals, don’t lose sight of doing well in school. Devote some time for homework and classwork and have an attitude of success.


If friends hassle you for staying in to finish homework, don’t feel bad. Sometimes you have to work, and other times you can play. Promise to meet up with them for the weekend.

, Fights are normal in romantic relationships, but they shouldn’t happen more often than not. If you find your romantic relationship takes up all of your energy, or you are constantly trying to make things better with a partner while your partner expects you to always apologize without taking responsibility, reconsider this relationship. A partner should add to your life, not take away from it.


Don’t be with a romantic partner that is constantly jealous.
Run as fast as you can if your partner begins to talk down to you, say you are worthless, or criticize your looks or appearance.
Run even faster if your partner becomes violent with you by pushing, shoving, or violently threatening you. If your partner humiliates you, isolates you, or intimidates you, leave. This is abuse and cannot be tolerated."

Recognize signs of family problems.,
Talk to your parents.,
Learn ways to get along with siblings.,
Find ways to spend time outside of home.,
Take abuse seriously.",How to Overcome Problems at School or Home2," Some family problems can affect your life greatly and create a lot of distress, which can be hard when you are trying to balance your home and school life. You want a place where you feel safe, and home isn’t it. This can make you feel stressed, exhausted, confused, isolated, and negative. Some signs of family problems can include:Frequent arguing and disagreements.
Poor communication.
Angry outbursts.
Avoidance.
Physical conflict.

, Especially if your family has gone through a major transition, such as a move, birth of a sibling, or divorce, talk to your parents and let them know how you feel. It’s hard to say whether they will respond in a way that benefits you, but you may be surprised to find they listen and support you.Tell your parents that you’re having a hard time with all the changes. Tell them you feel stressed and don’t know what to do.

, Maybe the biggest trigger at home is trying to get along with your sibling(s). Find ways to enjoy your time with your siblings in ways that don’t lead to conflict. Try to avoid topics or situations that tend to lead to fights. Find ways to show you care about your sibling.


Try to resolve any ongoing feuds. For instance, if you fight for time in the bathroom in the mornings, create a schedule. You can also start taking showers at night.

, If you really struggle to get along while at home, or want to avoid the fights that happen at home between siblings or parents, find an outside activity. Try to spend less time at home and more time with school activities or with friends.


This isn’t a long-term option, but should be used to temporarily get you through a tough time. Hopefully you can repair relationships and begin to spend more time with your family soon.

, If you are experiencing abuse in your home, seek help immediately. This can include from a parent, step-parent, relative, or sibling. Abuse within the home can include:Hitting, shoving or physical force that endangers or injures you.
Someone belittling, humiliating, or criticizing you.
Someone controlling everything you do, controlling your finances and your daily activities.
Sexually approaching you (giving you unwanted kisses, unwanted touches or sexual contact, including oral sex or penetration, or forcing you to do the same).
Blaming you for the behavior.

It might feel like it’ll never end and you’ll be miserable forever. Luckily, that’s not the case. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and you won’t be bound by circumstances forever. Having a good attitude will help you get through many of life’s difficulties, and having a positive outlook is associated with lower rates of distress and having a longer lifespan.Do your best to see the positives around you and spend more time focusing on those things instead of the negative things.

, Maybe you feel unsupported by your family. Reach out to your friends for support. Find friends you can talk to and express how you feel. Spend time with friends outside of school. If you don’t enjoy being at your house, ask to go to your friend’s house after school. Do what you can to surround yourself with people that care about you. After all, having friends is an important part of emotional health and happiness., You can join clubs or activities at school such as theater, debate team, math team, and sports teams. Maybe you want to spend less time at school, so you can join a dance class or start rock climbing. Check out activities through a religious organization that you find interesting. Start volunteering at a nursing home or shelter for animals. Do what you can do get involved, meet people, and have fun.

, This can mean asking a guidance counselor or therapist for help. You may be able to see a guidance counselor at school. If you attend university, your university will have a student health center and a student mental health center, and will likely offer free counseling services.

Make a list of any eye problems you’re experiencing.,
Identify any recent health issues or family history of eye problems.,
Prepare a list of any questions you have.,
Determine the type of eye doctor you should see.,
Research doctors in your area.,
Call to make an appointment.,
Ask whether your pupils will be dilated during your exam.",How to Prepare for an Eye Exam1," The could include seeing flashes of light, seeing double, experiencing blurry vision, eye pain, frequent headaches, or having difficulty distinguishing between reds and greens., This can help you determine when it’s time to schedule an eye exam. For example, if you had a recent injury or operations which you suspect is affecting your vision, call a clinic immediately to schedule an appointment.


If anybody in your family, especially your parents, has had glaucoma, cataracts, or other eye conditions such as macular degeneration, you may be at higher risk of developing the same conditions. For example, family history of glaucoma can increase your risk of developing the condition by four to nine times.Even if you don’t experience any symptoms yourself, you should schedule a yearly eye exam.
You are also at greater risk of eye problems if you have diabetes or hypertension, wear contact lenses, have had eye surgery, take medication with side effects that affect the eye, or if your occupation is highly demanding visually or eye-hazardous., This list can be helpful so that you can clearly state the purpose of your visit. It can also be helpful to have this list handy during your visit so that you don’t forget to ask anything you may have been wondering about.


You could ask your doctor a variety of questions, ranging from whether your vision has changed significantly since your last visit to whether you can do anything differently to care for your eyes. You can also ask what you should look out for when it comes to your vision or what the difference between wearing glasses and contact lenses is.
Be ready to listen to any answers your doctor may give to your questions. If you do have a problem with your vision, it will probably be best to address this sooner rather than later, and your doctor is your best bet for recommending any necessary treatment.

, There are two main types of eye doctors, and seeing the right eye care professional can affect the sort of care you receive.An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who, having undergone three to eight years of training after college (depending on their specialty), specializes in eye care. Ophthalmologists can perform eye surgery and treat a variety of medical conditions of the eye.
An optometrist can treat medical conditions of the eye with non-surgical methods. They can prescribe medicine, eye drops, glasses, and contacts. Optometrists have received 4+ years of training after college but are not medical doctors.

, Eye doctors can specialize in a variety of areas, such as retina, cornea, glaucoma, neurology, and pediatric, among others. Some eye doctors will provide general, non-specified care. Determine the sort of care you need by reviewing your symptoms and ocular history.Look individual doctors up through your insurance company’s website. Eye doctors will frequently list their main areas of practice on their websites. This is also the best way to make sure that your doctor takes your insurance. Make a decision about the doctor you’ll see after thoroughly reviewing all options in your area.

, If your vision problems are urgent, stress the urgency of your problem and try to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. You’ll find that some doctors are booked up if you give short-term notice that you would like to schedule an appointment. Still, you can ask if you can be put on a waiting list in case any spots open up.


There are suggested guidelines for how frequently people should have an eye exam depending on their age and whether or not they are at risk for visual impairment.
During your call, ask whether the office accepts your insurance and is in-network. This can affect how much you are billed for your visit.

, If so, you should plan to bring sunglasses and ask a friend or family member to drive you to and from your appointment. Dilation causes sensitivity to light and will make it hard to focus on nearby objects for up to several hours, so it may be unsafe for you to drive."

Carry your insurance card and ID with you, if applicable.,
Bring a method of payment.,
Download and fill out any forms you may need to bring.,
Bring a list of any medications you take.,
Bring your current eyewear.",How to Prepare for an Eye Exam2," These are both documents that the clinic may have to photocopy if you are a new patient so that they can start a file under your name.


If you’re a minor, your parent or guardian may need to show their insurance card and ID.

, You may have a co-pay for your visit; the amount will depend on what insurance you have. If you anticipate needing to buy glasses, bring a credit card with you. Many clinics will sell glasses and contact lenses in-house, so you can take care of this purchase right after your eye exam.


If you don't have your own method of payment, ask a parent or guardian to accompany you on your visit so that you can get the necessary items you need.

, It can save you time the day of the visit to have filled out any necessary documents ahead of time. You can often download any required documents from the doctor’s website. You can also ask the clinic to fax you any necessary documents when you schedule your appointment.

, Include the dosages for each medication. Also write down any nutritional supplements you take along with the dosages for these.

, This can help your doctor determine whether your current prescription is right for you. Make sure to bring your regular glasses, sunglasses, reading glasses, and/or contact lenses.You will likely be asked to remove your glasses or contact lenses during your exam, especially if your doctor does a test using dye, which could stain your eyewear."

Arrive 10 minutes early.,
Expect a pre-test.,
Expect a thorough exam.,
Be fitted for glasses, if applicable.,
Expect to update your prescription, if applicable.,
Schedule a follow-up visit.",How to Prepare for an Eye Exam3," If you are new to the clinic, this will give you ample time to fill out any paperwork the office may need in order to perform your exam.

, This can include being asked about your medical history, your history of ocular problems, and your family history. Your pre-test may consist of any of the following:An initial eye test to measure your eye pressure and visual acuity. This may be conducted by a clinical assistant. The main way this test is done is by looking into an instrument that blows a small puff of air into your eye. This can feel startling but lasts only a fraction of a second. The test can also be done by placing an instrument that looks like a pen on the surface of the eyeball. This is not painful — it feel like putting a contact lens in your eye.Pretests done by a clinical assistant may also involve placing your chin on the a chin rest of an instrument and looking at an image of a hot air balloon that goes in and out of focus. This test estimates your distance prescription. Another test may involve looking at a monitor and clicking a button whenever you see a flashing light., The exam will be conducted by your doctor in any of the following ways:


A cover test. This is a simple way to check your your eye alignment. A doctor or clinical assistant will cover one of your eyes and ask you to focus on an object across the room, then an object nearby.A retinoscopy. This test is much simpler than it sounds — the lights in the room are dimmed, you look at a chart with differently-sized letters, and your doctor flips lenses in a machine that’s in front of your eyes until you see the largest letter clearly. Slit lamp exam. For this test, you will rest your chin and forehead on a large instrument that will allow your doctor to examine the back of your eye. You will be asked to look in specific directions as the lamp shines a high-intensity light into your eyes. Sometimes the doctor will also use a hand-held lens to look at the back of your eye.Subjective refraction. The doctor may also show you a series of lens choices and ask you which of the two lenses looks clearer: choice one or choice two? You will pick one of the two options, then the doctor will fine tune and provide you with further options. The process is repeated until you reach the prescription that best matches your needs.

, This will involve taking into consideration your budget, face shape, prescription, and style. Vision insurance plans will often cover a portion of your glasses expenses, but the costs can still run high depending on the type of glasses you get, so set a maximum amount you’re willing to spend on your new glasses and try not to go beyond it.


The strength of your prescription may limit the style of glasses you get. Stronger prescriptions mean thicker lenses. Thick plastic frames can help conceal the lenses, and you may also consider buying high-index lenses, which are thinner and lighter. Take this into consideration when setting a budget, as high-index lenses tend to be more expensive.When setting your budget, also consider whether you will want anti-reflective coating, which will add to the price tag but can reduce your eyestrain and improve your vision by reducing glare.Many anti-glare coatings also have scratch resistance and easy to clean properties also., If you can’t see well with your current prescription, your doctor may recommend making adjustments. This will entail getting new lenses or glasses.


Consider how well you’re taking care of your glasses or your contact lenses. Change your habits, if need be, to prolong the life of your eyewear. If you wear glasses, it is recommended that you clean them with dish soap and a microfiber cloth.If you wear contacts, it is recommended that you take them out every night and rinse them thoroughly.

, Ask your doctor whether you should schedule an annual checkup or whether your visits should be more frequent. The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that all adults who require a prescription and any adults who are age 61 or older see their doctor yearly.If you don’t need vision correction and are between ages 18 and 60, the AOA recommends you have an eye exam every two years.
Those who are at risk for visual impairment must follow a different schedule. People between the ages of six and 18 years should have their eyes examined every year. If the eye doctor recommends a different schedule, follow your doctor's recommendation."

Perform the Visual Acuity Test.,
Measure the curve of your cornea with a keratometer.,
Use refraction to measure astigmatism.,
Understand your astigmatism prescription.",How to Measure Astigmatism1," At your eye doctor’s office, stand where your doctor tells you and look at a chart of numbers and letters on the wall. Cover one eye and read the lines of text to the smallest line you can clearly read, then repeat this with your other eye covered. This tests for myopia (near-sightedness) and hyperopia (far-sightedness), as well as astigmatism.Astigmatism accompanies myopia or hyperopia 50% of the time. Blurry vision could be caused by astigmatism or one of these other common conditions.
The results will be listed as a fraction, such as 20/20. 20/20 is normal visual acuity. The first number is the distance between you and the chart. The second number is the size of the letters on the last line you can read compared to normal visual acuity. For instance, someone with 20/40 vision has to be 20 feet from something that can be read at 40 feet (12.2 m) by someone with normal vision.;
, A keratometer is the instrument your eye doctor can use to measure the curve of your anterior cornea (the front surface of the cornea).Sit with your chin on the chin rest and look straight ahead into the instrument with one eye then the other, when prompted by your doctor. The keratometer shines a circle of light onto your cornea and measures how it reflects over your cornea’s surface.


This is an especially important test for getting contact lenses that fit correctly.
Though this method has its limitations, it’s still the standard way of measuring astigmatism., Sit up straight and look forward while your doctor places a retinoscope in front of your eyes. The retinoscope is a small, handheld instrument that measures light refraction on the eye. Your doctor will move a large machine with lenses (a phoropter) in front of your eyes that either clarify or obscure your vision, which measures how your eyes focus light. You will have to tell your doctor whether each lens makes your vision better or worse.The refraction test helps to establish the location of the irregular shape of the cornea. This will be called the ""axis"" in a corrective lens prescription.
Be honest with your doctor during these tests – even though technology is improving, your feedback still helps determine the outcomes of your eye exam.

, After your eye exam, your doctor will give you a prescription for glasses or contact lenses to help fix your astigmatism. The prescription will usually have three numbers – the first one relates to if you’re near-sighted or far-sighted, and the last two relate to your astigmatism.The second number is for “cylinder,” which is a measure of how flat or irregular your cornea is. This is measured in diopters. Most people with astigmatism have between 0.5-0.75 diopters; you probably need prescription lenses for a diopter measurement of 1.5 or higher.
The third number is for “axis” and goes from 0 to 180, which is a degree measurement of where on your cornea the astigmatism is located.

Use a corneal topographer for more precise measurements.,
Try a Placido disc for irregular astigmatism.The Placido disc is an old-fashioned, hand-held device that is shaped like a giant lollipop.,
Use a Scheimpflug device to measure the posterior cornea.The shape of your posterior cornea (the back surface of the cornea) can influence the severity of your astigmatism.Keratometry can only measure the front of your cornea, but Scheimpflug imaging uses tomography to get more accurate readings of how thick your cornea is and what the back of it looks like.This method can be helpful in predicting how successful surgery may be in correcting your astigmatism.",How to Measure Astigmatism2," A topographer is a newer version of the keratometer.Your doctor will have you sit at a table and look into a bowl. This bowl's inner surface is covered in a pattern of concentric rings. A digital camera sits at the base of the bowl and charts the cornea's surface by measuring the reflected pattern in the eye. This basically creates a contour map of your eye, and it’s an excellent technique for measuring irregular astigmatism.Most corneal topography tests measure 8,000 to 10,000 points on the cornea, making it the most accurate keratometry test.
Other advanced ways of measuring astigmatism include autorefractors that measure refraction, and the IOLMaster that makes extensive measurements of the interior and exterior of the eye. The IOLMaster is usually used before cataract surgery., The disc has several sets of concentric circles painted on one side, and is used to measure the regularity of your cornea’s surface. Your doctor holds the disc up to their own eye with the rings pointed towards you, and they look into your eye. Sit still and look straight ahead. The image of your cornea reflects back, and where there is irregular shape it makes the concentric rings look distorted to your doctor.This old-fashioned method can help to diagnose keratoconus, a disorder that causes irregular astigmatism due to thinning and protruding of the cornea.

Grab a plain white printer paper, a ruler, a tape measure, a black marker, and invisible tape.,
Using the ruler and the marker, starting from either top corner of the page, begin to measure and mark points in 2.0mm segments straight down the same side of the page until you have at least 10 of them.,
Now go ahead and draw your horizontal lines by appropriately placing your ruler and connecting corresponding points on each side.,
Place and stick the page vertically on a wall in a way that the middle part of the back and white area is approximately at your eye level and centered between your eyes; you also need to make sure that the sides of your paper are parallel to the sides of the wall and the room is well lit with a good light source.

,
Put everything down, grab the ruler, stand in the position you were when you placed the page on the wall, cover your left eye, and slowly start walking straight back while keeping your right eye on the center of the page.,
Grab the tape measure and measure the metric distance straight from the bottom of the wall to where the front of your feet were.,
Now comes the fun calculation part which is simply 138/d and will give you the number that you need to put in the denominator of the standard 20/xx model of visual acuity for your right eye.,
Repeat the last 3 steps this time covering the right eye to measure the acuity of your left eye.,
Now that you have calculated your visual acuity, look at the logic behind it.",How to Measure Your Vision at Home,";
, Repeat the procedure for the other side of the page starting from the other top corner this time. This step is done so that you can draw perfectly parallel horizontal lines from one side to the other.

, Then using the marker, start at the top and fill in the space between the 1st and 2nd lines, making the area between them completely black; repeat this for the space between the 3rd and 4th lines, 5th and 6th lines, and in the same order until you reach the last line. Now you should have a page with 2.0mm thick black horizontal lines separated by 2.0mm from each other.

,, As you keep walking back you will notice that it gradually becomes harder to distinguish between the black segments and white segments of the page till you get to a point that the whole page seems like plain grey with no lines. At this point stop and slightly move forward till you can just distinguish the dark and light areas. Mark your position by placing the ruler on the floor just in front of your feet and parallel to the wall.

, Note that to be as accurate as possible, the tape measure must be perpendicular both to the wall and to the ruler when you perform your measurement. This article will use the symbol ""d"" for this measured distance in the calculations step.

, For instance if you measured 3.45m for ""d"" and insert it in the formula you will get 40 and thus an acuity of 20/40 for that eye. Furthermore the smaller your ""d"" the larger the denominator and the worse the acuity would be and vice versa. Note that 20/20 is achieved at a distance of 6.9m!

, You can also repeat them a 3rd time with both eyes open to measure your binocular visual acuity.

, What the visual acuity actually measures is the smallest angular distance between 2 points in space that the eye can resolve (ie. see both points rather than one). This so called ""Minimum Angle of Resolution"" or MAR is standardized to be 1.0 minutes of arc (ie. 1/60th degree) for a normal eye. Thus if a person with 1.0arcmin acuity mark 2 points on a wall with 2.0mm separation between them, he can't be farther than {(2/2)/}=6900mm=6.9m away from the wall to resolve the separation! if the MAR is 2.0arcmin (acuity of 20/40), either the separation between the 2 points must be doubled or the distance of 6.9m must be divided in half for the person to be able to see, and this is how you just calculated your acuity!

Become informed.",How to Reduce The Effects of Macular Degeneration," An ophthalmologist will determine which stage of AMD you have based on the amount of drusen found in your eyes. Drusen are white or yellow deposits found in the retina.Early stage: Medium-sized drusen equivalent to width of a hair strand and no vision loss.
Intermediate stage: Large drusen and/or pigment changes; typically no vision loss.
Late stage: This consists of two types:

Geographical atrophy/dry macular degeneration: The photoreceptors in the macula are damaged. The eyes cannot use light to convey vision to the brain. You may suffer a gradual onset of the condition. You will experience vision loss.Neovascular macular degeneration/wet macular degeneration: This is caused by abnormal vessel growth, in which the vessels can eventually swell and break. Fluid builds up in and underneath the macula and causes visual changes. The onset is much faster than dry macular degeneration.;
, Dry macular degeneration is due to a degeneration of the cells in the retina. The degeneration or dying of these cells and the lack of excess fluid gives it its ""dry"" name. These cells are also known as photoreceptors, or cells that use light entering the retina to help our brain understand the images via the visual cortex. Basically these light sensitive areas help us to understand what we are seeing.


The degeneration occurs because fatty lipids called drusen build up in the macula as we age. This build-up is seen during an eye exam as yellow spots on the macula.AMD does not lead to total blindness, but it can drastically inhibit the central fields of vision.
The “dry” form of macular degeneration is more common compared to its “wet” form. The following are the signs and symptoms of dry macular degeneration:Blurring of printed words.
More light needed when reading.
Difficulty seeing in the dark.
Difficulty in recognizing faces.
Greatly diminished central vision.
Noticeable blind spot in the field of vision.
Gradual vision loss.
Geometric shapes or inanimate objects mistakenly identified as people.



, This kind of AMD happens when blood vessels grow abnormally underneath the macula. Because of the macula’s growing size, the blood vessels may begin to leak or ooze fluid and blood into the retina and macula or, rarely, they may fully rupture. Though wet macular degeneration is less common than dry macula, it is a more aggressive visual disease that can lead to blindness. The cause for macular degeneration is unknown, but several studies have stated that there are risk factors that can lead anyone to develop the condition later on in life. Its signs and symptoms include:Straight lines that look wavy.
Visual blind spot.
Loss of central vision.
Rapid vision loss.
No pain.
Scarring of the blood vessels, which may lead to irreversible loss of vision if not addressed promptly.

, Macular degeneration is a common age-related condition. As you get older, the risk of developing AMD increases. At least one-third of adults over the age of 75 have some level of AMD., If one or both of your parents developed macular degeneration, then chances are you might develop the same condition when you hit the 60-year-old mark. However, remember that genes aren't everything and how you take care of yourself matters, too.


In general, women and caucasians are more at risk of developing macular degeneration., Smokers are at high risk of developing this eye condition. There have been several studies that have linked smoking to the deterioration of the macula.Cigarette smoke is linked with damage to the retina.If you're a smoker (especially if you're female or caucasian), macular degeneration is something you need to be conscious of, even if the symptoms aren't present., Knowing your overall health can be a major factor for developing AMD. Those afflicted with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are at risk. Even non-diabetics whose diet is comprised of carbohydrates high on the glycemic index tend to develop macular degeneration later on in life. Remember that one sign of wet macular degeneration is leaking of blood from the retinal vessels. This will worsen when you have clogged arteries due to plaque deposits.

, How frequently are you exposed to fluorescent lighting? There is concern that the UV radiation from fluorescent lighting may increase your risk of eye disease.In addition, if you live in an area in which your eyes are often exposed to sunlight, this may also increase your risk., Diagnosis is done during a routine eye exam where the ophthalmologist will use eye drops in order to dilate or enlarge your pupils. In case you are suffering from dry macular degeneration, the ophthalmologist can easily detect the presence of drusen upon inspection.

, You will also be asked to look at the Amsler grid, which looks like graph paper. It is possible that you have macular degeneration when you see that some of the lines are wavy. To check if you have symptoms, print the Amsler grid test from the Prevent Blindness website and follow these instructions:


Place the reversed chart 24 inches away at eye level.
Put your reading glasses on and cover one eye completely with your hand.
Focus on the center dot for one minute and repeat steps with the other eye.
If any of the lines on the grid appear to be wavy, contact your eye care professional immediately.

, This method will involve inserting dye into a vein in your arm. The dye is then photographed as it travels to the veins of the retina. It can detect leakages, which can indicate wet macular degeneration. ,The dye should be seen in the optic nerve about eight to 12 seconds after injection.
The dye should be seen in the retinal area about 11 to 18 seconds after injection.

, This exam will look at the multiple layers of your retina using light waves. The test can assess the thickness of your retina, the anatomy of the retinal layers, and if there is anything abnormal in the retina like fluid, blood or new blood vessels.The doctor may first dilate your eyes, though OCT can also be performed through an non-dilated pupil.
Then you will place your chin on the chin rest to stabilize your head, and refrain from moving.
A light beam will be aimed at the eye.
Using light waves, the exam can painlessly detect live tissue in a matter of seconds.

, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main chemical that causes the abnormal growth of blood vessels. When this chemical is suppressed through anti-VEGF agents or antiangiogenics, the growth of the blood vessels can be inhibited. Your doctor will know if this is a suitable option for you.


One good example of antiangiogenics is Bevacizumab. The usual dose is an injection of 1.25 to 2.5 milligrams of the drug into the vitreous cavity of the eye. This drug is usually given every four weeks over a period of four to six weeks. The antiangiogenics Ranibizumab is given at 0.5 mg, and Aflibercept is given at 2 mgThe procedure will be done with the use of a very fine needle together with local anesthesia to prevent pain. In general, the whole procedure is painless with only slight discomfort.
Some side effects include increased intraocular pressure infection, bleeding, and damage to the lens. You should obtain better visual acuity within one year. This can begin as early as two weeks and usually peaks by three months after the third injection.

, This procedure uses a drug and light therapy to help stop blood vessel growth. It can be an effective treatment for wet macular degeneration only.


This is a two-step procedure done in one visit. A drug known as verteporfin or Visudyne, will be administered intravenously. It works by stopping additional blood vessel growth, which occurs in wet macular degeneration, and is done 15 minutes before the photodynamic therapy.
Then, light with a correct wavelength will be applied on the eyes, particularly to the abnormal blood vessels. The light will activate the verteporfin, which was administered earlier to seal off the leaky blood vessels.Since the light is tuned to the correct wavelength, it eliminates the threat of visually impairing scar tissue. Ask your doctor if this therapy is safe for you. Anti-VEGF is currently the standard of care first line agent, and PDT is sometimes used in conjunction with anti-VEGF therapy., If you experience any sudden headaches, vision changes or any other unexplained pain while undergoing treatment for macular degeneration, visit the nearest emergency facility and immediately contact your eye doctor.

, When it comes to macular degeneration, the most affected area is the central vision, with the peripheral vision still partially intact. For this reason, people with macular degeneration can still use their peripheral vision to compensate. A magnifying glass can help make object seem larger so that they are easier to see. Magnifying glasses vary from 1.5 to 20 times magnification. They are easy to travel with. Many can fold up to pocket size.
Try a stand magnifying glass. This type varies from two to 20 times magnification. It can be mounted so that your hands are free. It is helpful for patients who may also suffer from unstable or shaky hands. Some types have an additional light feature to aid in dim lighting situations., This type of device varies from 2.5 to 10 times magnification. It can be useful to help see distances., With the same variations of magnification as telescopes, binoculars are useful because you can use both eyes to view items., This type of magnifier is mounted on the patient's glasses and is useful for distance vision. It allows the patient to transfer between distance viewing and telescopic vision. There are also spectacle lenses for normal viewing.


These work similar to bifocals.
These are approved and prescribed by Low Vision Specialists., This stand-mounted video camera magnifies reading or writing material onto a video screen. You can use this type of magnifier to aid in a variety of tasks, such as reading, writing, crafts and viewing photos. Some can also underline and highlight information. This type of device can also be used with a computer., This machine will read typewritten text out loud.


Use Ocular Recognition (OCR) software to turn your personal computer into a reading machine. ,, These types of lenses work by absorbing the light transmitted through the eye. They reduce glare and harmful ultraviolet rays. These lenses can transition between light and dark areas.
They can be worn over prescribed glasses , Macular degeneration cannot be prevented since it is related to aging. However, getting regular examination can lead to early detection and prompt management. When your macular degeneration is detected early enough, you can exponentially delay the loss of vision.


Starting at the age of 40, regular eye examination should be done at least every six months or according to your ophthalmologist's advice.

, You should expect the eye doctor to do a few different types of eye exams to look for drusen, vessel damage, pigment changes in the retina or visual disturbances. Some examples of exams to detect visual disturbances are as follows:


Visual acuity test: This tests your vision at a distance using a chart.Amsler grid: This checks for central vision disturbances by allowing the patient to dictate whether they are viewing straight lines on the grid, or if they appear wavy. Wavy lines indicate macular degeneration.Dilated eye exam: In this exam, pupils are dilated so allow the doctor to see the optic nerve and retina to evaluate for damage. The doctor will also check the retina for pigment changes. Pigments in the retina indicate poor light reception. Fluorescein angiogram: This test will evaluate the arteries in the eye in order to detect leaky vessels. The doctor will inject a dye into the arm a patient’s arm.Optical coherence tomography: This exam is done after first dilating the eyes. Then an infrared light is used to image the retina, therefore allowing the examiner to determine damaged areas. , Aside from the many destructive effects of smoking on the entire body, it can also lead to macular degeneration. Smoking contains tar that can stimulate the formation of drusen (waste deposits on the eye). In addition to this, smoking contains caffeine which is a known stimulant that can increase blood pressure. The blood vessels beneath the retina and macula can easily burst when blood pressure is high.


Smoking can double your chances of having macular degenerative disease, compared to those who don’t smoke.It's bad for you, your eyes, your organs, and even those around you.
Even if you stop smoking, it may take a few years before the effects will wear off. Consider that an invitation to start the journey of quitting sooner rather than later.

, Take your medication, attend your scheduled exams and make lifestyle changes to adapt to this.


If you are suffering from hypertension and are diagnosed with wet macular degeneration, for example, the already damaged vessels in your eye have trouble compensating with an elevated blood pressure. This can lead to an increased potential for bursting vessels, thereby causing more leakage., Exercise has a multitude of health benefits, and that includes benefits for your eyes. Drusen formation is related to high levels of cholesterol and fat. Exercise can burn fat and eliminate bad cholesterol, preventing this waste buildup.It is advisable to exercise at least three times a week. Make sure you concentrate on aerobics exercises that can make you sweat and burn fat., The eyes are constantly exposed to harsh ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun and pollutants from smog. The continuous exposure of the eyes to these elements can lead to oxidative damage. The oxidation of the cells in the eyes can lead to macular degeneration and other eye diseases. As a way to counteract this process, you need to eat foods rich in antioxidants. The most common antioxidants that can help you are Vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, lutein, and copper.Vitamin C: The recommended daily dose of vitamin C is 500 milligrams. Some good sources of vitamin C are: broccoli, cantaloupe, cauliflower, guava, bell peppers, grapes, oranges, berries, lychees, and squash.
Vitamin E: The recommended daily dose of vitamin E is 400 milligrams. Some good sources of vitamin E are: almonds, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, spinach, peanut butter, collard greens, avocados, mango, hazelnuts, and Swiss chard.
Zinc: The recommended daily dose of zinc is 25 milligrams. Some good sources of zinc are: lean beef, skinless chicken, lean lamb, pumpkin seeds, yogurt, soybeans, peanuts, starchy beans, sunflower butter, pecans, lutein, kale, spinach, beet greens, lettuce, asparagus, okra, artichokes, watercress, persimmons, and green peas.
Copper, lutein and zeaxanthin: Both lutein and zeaxanthin are naturally found in the retina and lens. They work as natural antioxidants, aiding in absorption of harsh light and UV rays. Both can be found in leafy green vegetables.

Get two milligrams of copper daily.
Get 10 milligrams of lutein daily.
Get two milligrams of zeaxanthin daily. , According to research, beta carotene can increase the risk of lung cancer, especially if the patient is concurrently smoking. Research also shows that beta carotene has no effect on reducing the stage advancement of AMD. Now, doctors typically recommend a list of supplements that omits beta carotene., Over-exposure to UV light from the sun can damage the eyes and may contribute to the development of macular degeneration. Use sunglasses certified with blue light and UV protection for best results.

, Some activities that may seem like everyday tasks should now be approached with care. Depending on the severity of your vision, some tasks may require the help of a caregiver, friend or family member. It is better to ask for help in these situations, rather than deal with potentially harmful consequences. Be careful when engaging in these activities:


Driving Riding a bike
Operating heavy machinery

, As an AMD patient, it may seem as though your life is suddenly out of your control. However, as a patient, there are several things that you can do along with the care of your eye care professional to help regulate your situation. Getting informed is the best way to fully understand the disease as well as adhere to the treatment regimen. Start by learning about AMD, treatment options, and new technology aimed to help rehabilitation."

Grab a ruler with millimeter units.,
Stand in front of a mirror.,
Close your right eye to center your left pupil.,
Read and measure the distance to your right pupil.",How to Measure Your Interpupillary Distance1," In order to measure your PD at home, you will need a ruler that has millimeter units.If you do not have a ruler at home, you can print out a PD measurement ruler online from many vision center and eyeglass retail websites. Just be sure that when you print the page you set your printer so that it does not scale the image.Some online eyeglass retailers use programs that allow you to photograph yourself holding a credit card up to your face for scale, but most require you to manually measure the distance.;
, If you're measuring your own PD, you'll need to use a mirror. Make sure that you're in a well-lit area so that you can line up the ruler and see the ruler markings. In order to get a good reading, you'll need to stand approximately eight inches (20 centimeters) from the mirror.Hold the ruler right above your eyes, straight across your eyebrows.
Keep your head straight and upright to ensure a proper measurement.

, It's easiest to measure one eye at a time by closing the other eye. Start by closing your right eye and holding the zero millimeter mark right above the exact center of your left pupil. Try to get an exact alignment with the zero mark, as this could alter the reading for your whole measurement., Without moving your head or the ruler at all, open your right eye and find the exact millimeter mark that falls on your right pupil. Make sure you're looking straight ahead at the mirror to ensure an accurate reading. The number (in millimeters) that lines up with the center of your pupil, or as close to center as you can measure, is your PD.It's best to try remeasuring your PD three or four times to make sure that your reading is consistently accurate."

Close your eyes.,
Rub your eyes while they are closed.,
Use your palms to apply heat to your eyes.,
Try relaxation eye exercises.",How to Relax Your Eyes1," Do this sitting up to prevent yourself from falling asleep. Close them as tightly as you can to help your eyes relax.


Hold this position for a few seconds, and then quickly open your eyes. Repeat it three to five times to help your eyes relax.After doing it quickly a few times, close your eyes very tightly and hold the pose for about a minute. Focus on your breathing to help you relax even further.;
, Rub your eyes very gently with your fingertips, as if almost tickling them. Then, cover your eyes completely with the palms of your hand to block out any light. Make sure your hands are clean before doing this, and wash them if necessary, to prevent picking up an infection.


Rubbing your eyes can help to relax them, and following this with total darkness can have a very soothing effect.

, Your eyes are very sensitive so not much heat is required to have a noticeable impact. Simply rub the palms of your hands together to create friction, and then gently place your warm hands over your eyes while they are closed. The heat can have a very soothing effect.


Note to always wash your hands first to prevent the spread of infection (as touching your hands to your eyes without washing them first is one of the fastest ways to catch a cold).

, There are a number of exercises you can try to help your eyes relax. Not all of these work for everyone, but by trial and error you can see which ones work for you.


Try blinking. Particularly when looking at a computer screen, which can be straining on the eyes, practice blinking every four seconds. See if this helps to relax your eyes.
Roll your eyes. Close your eyes, and then roll your eyes in all directions. This can provide a very relaxing sensation, almost like a massage, and also can ease the tension in your eye muscles.
Try ""visual scanning."" Especially if you have been focusing on close-up objects like a computer screen for a long time, spend some time focusing on far away objects. Look to the corners of the room and take note of the visual detail of your surroundings (this is called ""scanning"").

Stand close to your friend and face one another.,
Look above your friend's head.,
Have your friend take your measurements.",How to Measure Your Interpupillary Distance2," You should stand approximately 8 inches (20 centimeters) away from your friend, just as you would stand if you were measuring your own PD in the mirror.Do not stand too close or too far away to ensure an accurate reading.

, Unlike measuring your own PD in the mirror (where you can't avoid looking at your own reflection), having a friend measure your PD requires you to look past that individual. Try having your friend crouch or sit in front of you while you stand so that she is outside your field of vision, and stare at something in the distance about 10 to 20 feet away., You'll need to keep your eyes perfectly still while your friend measures your PD. He should line the ruler up just as you would on yourself in the mirror. Your friend should align the zero millimeter mark with the center of one pupil and measure across where the center of your other pupil falls."
"
Schedule an appointment with your eye doctor.,
Have your pupil size measured.,
Leave with a prescription and your PD.",How to Measure Your Interpupillary Distance3," Having your PD measured by an eye doctor will typically require an appointment. While you're there, your eye doctor will most likely want to test your vision to make sure that your optical prescription is up to date. This may include testing your eye muscles, visual acuity, visual field, as well as a refraction and retinal exam.If you do not yet have an eye doctor, you can find one in your area by searching online or checking your local phone book.
If you've had your vision tested within the last year, you shouldn't need a new vision exam. The eye doctor who performed your vision test may also have your PD in your chart from the previous exam.

, Depending on the tests you have done, your doctor may decide to check the size of your pupils using a digital pupillometer.Your eye doctor may also choose to use an ocular measurement device.Both of these handheld devices can measure the size of your pupil and the distance between your pupils.


A pupillometer looks like a large pair of binoculars, and all you need to do is look through the lenses while your doctor takes your measurements.An ocular measurement device may look like a digital camera, depending on the make and model used by your doctor.

, The advantage of having an eye doctor measure your PD is that you will leave with both an accurate measurement and a valid prescription for your next pair of eyeglasses. Many online retailers require your PD and a prescription in order to sell you glasses, so having an up-to-date eye exam will simplify the process and ensure that you have the right prescription for your eyes.

Take a break.Especially if you do large amounts of computer work during your day, it can take a toll on your eyes.,
Limit screen time.Since the main culprit for eye strain is today's culture is time spent in front of a computer, a TV, a cell phone, or another device with a screen, finding alternatives such as reading a paper book rather than reading on your iPad can be a huge help.,
Wash your eyes with cold water frequently.,
See a doctor.",How to Relax Your Eyes2," It is exhausting for your eyes to focus on the screen for long periods of time, but unfortunately, it can be hard to escape in today's day and age. Stand up and take a walk around during lunch break to give your eyes a chance to look around and focus on other things without having a screen right in front of them. This will make it much more manageable to get through your day with less strain on your eyes.


Give your eyes a break by following the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

,


Also, to reduce the harmful effects of screen time that cannot be avoided (such as on your computer at work), try positioning the screen lower and using an anti-glare screen to diminish the strain on your eyes.

, Try this once in the morning, once in the evening, and any time during the day that you feel your eyes are particularly sore or strained. Cold water has a soothing effect that can help your eyes to relax.


Another option is to apply cold cucumber slices over each eye, and to leave them on for 5-10 minutes. The coolness, as well as the chance to relax your eyes by keeping them shut, can make a noticeable difference.

, If you are having continued eye strain that is bothering you in your day-to-day life, consult your physician. It is possible that you have a vision problem, or another eye condition, that may be contributing to the discomfort and/or tension you feel. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry, and to see a doctor to ensure that nothing more serious is going on (as well as to obtain appropriate medical treatment if needed).

Rest and avoid pain-inducing activities.,
Apply ice to your knee.,
Use a knee brace or patellar immobilizer.,
Take anti-inflammatories or painkillers.,
Stretch your quadriceps.,
Get a leg massage.,
Try acupuncture.,
Consider shoe orthotics.,
Try therapeutic ultrasound treatments.,
Seek out some physiotherapy.,
See a medical specialist.",How to Reduce the Pain of Osgood Schlatters Disease," Probably the most important action you can take to help alleviate the pain from OSD is to stop playing the sport or doing the activity that is contributing most to the problem.Sports that involve a lot of jumping, such as basketball and volleyball, are particularly bad for OSD.


The amount of rest needed varies widely and depends on the person, but expect anywhere from a few weeks to a few months before a significant reduction in pain and swelling is noticed.
Pain with OSD can be sporadic or nearly constant; it usually occurs in just one knee, but sometimes develops in both.;
, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries, including OSD.Cold therapy should be applied to the inflamed bump (tibial tuberosity) just below your kneecap for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.
If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of peas from your freezer.

, While resting and applying ice to your knee, consider also using a special knee brace or kneecap immobilizer while having to walk in order to take the stress off your patellar tendon.Knee braces can be found at stores that sell rehabilitation and medical supplies — ask a physical therapist, physician, or chiropractor for more info.
Alternatively, you can try a patellar tendon strap, which fits around your leg just below your kneecap. It can support your kneecap's tendon during physical activity and distribute some of the force away from the tibial tuberosity.Complete inactivity is not necessary with OSD, but consider switching to other fun activities that don't involve jumping or running, such as swimming, rowing or golf.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with the pain and inflammation of OSD.Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics (painkillers) such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). These medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. Check with your doctor before taking any medications.


Keep in mind that NSAIDs do not shorten the course of OSD.Steroids such as cortisone have powerful anti-inflammatory properties, but injections should not be given to adolescents with OSD due to the risk factors — mainly, potential tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and reduced immune system function.

, Once the acute knee pain has settled down, start doing some quadriceps stretching. One of the causes of OSD is repetitive quadriceps contractions (from too much jumping, for example) and also overly tight quadricep tendons. As such, learning how to stretch this muscle group may help reduce the tension and inflammation in the area where the kneecap's tendon attaches to the upper shinbone (tibia).To stretch your quadriceps while standing, bend your leg behind you so your knee is bent, your heel about at the level of your butt. Grab your ankle and pull your foot toward your body until you feel a nice stretch in your lower thigh and knee. Hold for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily until you notice reduced symptoms.
Stretches for the hamstrings, which are also commonly tight, may also be performed. Bending over at the waist and trying to touch your toes is a good basic hamstring stretch.

, A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle tension, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your thigh muscles and kneecap area. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


The therapist may use a focal cross-friction technique on your kneecap area if they think there's a build-up of scar tissue.
Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking thin needles into specific points on the body to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture is not commonly recommended for OSD, but it's virtually risk-free and certainly worth a try, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


Acupuncture points that may provide relief to your knee pain are not all located near where the pain is — some can be in distant areas of your body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).

, A risk factor for OSD is poor biomechanics while running and jumping, and sometimes that's caused by flat feet and knock-kneed posture.Orthotics are customized shoe inserts that support the arch of your foot, align your legs and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking, running and jumping.Health professionals who make custom orthotics include podiatrists and some osteopaths and chiropractors.
Some health insurance plans cover the cost of customized orthotics, but if yours doesn't, then consider a pair of off-the-shelf insoles — they're considerably less expensive and may provide quick relief.

, Therapeutic ultrasound is a treatment used by some physicians, chiropractors and physical therapists in order to reduce inflammation and stimulate healing for a variety of injuries, including OSD.. Like its name infers, it emits sound frequencies through crystals (you can't hear it) that positively impact cells and tissues of the body.


Although a single ultrasound treatment can sometimes completely relieve your pain and inflammation, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.
Therapeutic ultrasound treatments are painless and usually last 10 – 20 minutes.

, If your OSD is not responding to home care or alternative therapies, then consider getting some physiotherapy for your knee. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your quadriceps and knee.Physiotherapy is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic musculoskeletal problems.
A physical therapist can also treat your knee with therapeutic ultrasound, maybe even tape your patella and possibly also make you a pair of custom orthotics.

, You may need to see a medical specialist such as an orthopedist or rheumatologist in order to rule out more serious causes of knee pain that can mimic OSD — conditions like a patellar or tibial stress fracture, bone infection, inflammatory arthritis, bone tumor, osteochondritis dissecans or Perthes disease.X-rays, bone scans, diagnostic ultrasound, MRI and CT scans are tools that specialists may use to help diagnose your knee pain.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a bone infection.

Assess the injury when it happens.,
Put heat or cold onto your toe.,
Take medication.",How to Relieve a Sore Damaged Toe1," Check to see if there is an open wound in case you need urgent help. A broken toe is serious and cannot be fixed at home in case it is broken or fractured. You may need a cast, splint or medication. If your toe is cold, numb, tingling, blue or grey, also go to the nearest emergency room. Basically, if anything looks unusual or scares you, it's time to go to the doctor..


Be sure to rest your foot. Don’t walk on it! You may want to elevate your foot above your heart by propping it on a table or stool while you treat it or let it relax. No one wants to wear out an already painful body part.If your injury is from walking, consider getting new shoes or a gel cushion insert. It can be a result of uncomfortable, ill-fitting, or damaged shoes, or exercise. Think about how you might have incurred the injury. Sometimes if this is a chronic condition, a doctor could recommend exercises or surgery.If you just have a small cut, clean it, put antibiotic ointment on it and put on a bandage.
Some pain might just be normal pain from walking in an uncomfortable shoe. If this is the case, just don't wear those shoes again while exercising.;
, Hot and cold temperatures can help alleviate all sorts of pain.You may also consider rubbing your toe since some say a massage helps tired feet. You can use lotion and rub the parts of the toe that hurt to relax and soothe tense muscles.Heat helps soothe muscles and cold is anti-inflammatory and numbing. This will help your toe feel better temporarily and offer you some relief.For these reasons, cold is better to use on a direct injury or discomfort (like if you stubbed your toe), while heat should be used for general discomfort without an obvious cause (i.e. a chronic ache in your toe).
Heat and cold are remedies for many different types of injuries and pain. Remember this for the future!

, This might include over-the-counter fixes like topical creams or ointments or taking an anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).While it won't fix the actual problem, medicines from a regular pharmacy or store can help alleviate some of the pain. Remember, if there is a physical problem that looks really bad, seek help outside of your home.


Always read the labels and warnings for medicines.
If in doubt, ask a local pharmacist what type of medicine is best.
Talk to a doctor before giving aspirin to a child or teenager under 19. Aspirin can put your child at risk for a rare but serious condition called Reye's Syndrome.
Some anit-inflammatory drugs have blood-thinning properties, which is not always appropriate for everyone (such as people already taking blood thinners), or should be avoided if you are bleeding. If you take blood thinners, talk to your doctor about which over-the-counter products are acceptable for you to use

Then think of the hurt flying out. It's like magic. You might want to try pretending to blow the pain away, instead. Remember, you can use this trick with other bodily pain, too.


Never underestimate the power of the mind.
Picturing the pain leaving your body might just make pain leave your mind.

, Studies show that getting your mind onto food, a positive thought, helps you avoid the pain. Instead of focusing on the pain, you will become immersed in memories or fantasies of the taste. It's a bit of a distraction. Besides, thinking of pizza is way better than thinking of a bad toe!


One study showed that chocolate is the most popular food fantasy., When you get your mind off your toe, you can lessen the mental pain. Distraction takes your mind away from the bad feelings. You may have already done this on your own by watching TV or playing with your phone to distract yourself from your feelings. You can also find a good book or music, or focus on your breathing in and out.Studies show clearing your mind can act almost as an anestheticLooking at old photos can also lessen pain. They also say meditating or fantasizing can take your mind off the pain., Imagining things in your mind other than what is actually going on can help your mind take you to different places. Instead of focusing on the pain at hand, you will relax and go someplace else.


Start out by closing your eyes and breathing slowly.

Don’t just rely on your friends for medical advice. Ask doctors, nurses and other specialists.
Some people have lost toes from untreated injuries, so it's better to be on the safe side.
It’s a good idea to always know the nearest route to the emergency room.

, If any medicine you took is not working in about an hour, you may need to get more help. You might have a more severe problem that requires medical attention. Remember, not all toe injuries can be treated at home.


Keep track of what medicines or methods you have tried on your toe so that if you go to the emergency room later on you know what to report to the doctors.
Always tell someone you trust if you are having strange symptoms from medicine.

, After you've tried distracting yourself or using physical methods like medicine or hot/cold to lessen the pain, check again to see you have an infection. See again if the toe is bleeding, draining, cold, numb, tingling, blue or grey. Remember that some injuries can get worse over time. It's not ok to just ""fix"" the problem and completely forget about it.


If you go to the urgent care or emergency room, be sure to bring a friend or family member.
Bring your insurance card, identification and wallet to the emergency room or urgent care center. If you are going alone, plan ahead how you will get back if you are unable to drive due to your sore toe.
Be sure to tell anyone at the doctor's office or emergency room if you have a bone sticking out or any unusual coloration.

When elevating your feet, try not to cross your ankles or legs because that can put too much pressure on veins and restrict blood flow.

, If your diet is high in salt, it can contribute to swollen feet.When you have too much salt, your body holds on to it, and in the process, also holds on to extra water, which can contribute to swelling.In addition to the feet and ankles, your face and hands can also be puffy when eating a high-salt diet.
Most processed foods (such as canned foods, frozen dinners, and salad dressings) are high in salt (sodium), so buy more fresh produce and meats from the grocery store and prepare them at home.Store-bought products especially high in sodium include canned tomato and pasta sauces, soups, salsas, crackers, pickled veggies, lunch meat, and even cheeses. Check the label for the sodium content, and look for words like ""low-sodium.""Even some fresh meats may be injected with salt and water.Compare brands. Some brands will have less salt than others.Your dietary sodium intake should be between 1,500 mg and 2,300 mg per day, depending on your gender and size., Because weight can contribute to swelling, losing weight can help with swelling in your legs.Try changing up your diet so you're eating more fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains, while slowing down on empty sugar calories. Incorporating a diet change with an increase in exercise can speed up the process.

, When you have tight clothing around your thighs, it can limit circulation. Therefore, try to skip garters and other types of clothing that may restrict circulation., Wearing compression stockings can help decrease the fluid in your legs. Basically, it wraps around your leg, giving it the support it needs to keep fluid from pooling there.You can find compression stockings online, at medical supply stores, and sometimes at your pharmacy.

, If you're having trouble with swollen feet, you probably need a new pair of shoes to help with your treatment. Change to shoes that grip your heel, provide enough room to wiggle your toes, and have good arch support. The best time to try on shoes is in the afternoon, as your feet will be the most swollen then; that way, you can get shoes that fit you all the time, even when your feet swell more.If your shoes are too tight, they can cut down on blood flow, as well as cause other problems with your feet, such as light sprains.

, Work on you legs by rubbing up from your feet towards the top of you body; you just need to work on your ankles and calves. Don't rub so hard that you cause yourself pain, but do it firmly. This type of massage can help reduce fluid near your ankles and feet., If home remedies and natural treatments aren't as effective at reducing the swelling in your legs as you'd hoped, then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your feet and legs and see if the swelling is caused by anything more serious., Certain medications can contribute to swollen feet. For instance, antidepressants, medications for high blood pressure, and hormone-based pills (such as birth control) can all have this side effect. Steroids can also cause this problem., In many cases, edema is caused by a minor problem. However, sometimes it can indicate a more serious health condition. Discuss the possibilities with your doctor.For instance, for milder forms, pregnancy or PMS (premenstrual syndrome) might be the cause. Also, you may not be moving enough, or you may be eating too much salty food.More serious causes include cirrhosis, kidney disease, kidney damage, congestive heart failure, chronic venous insufficiency, or a damaged lymphatic system.,, Your doctor will talk with you about the problems you've been having with your legs. She may also ask about any other symptoms you may be having. In addition, she may run some diagnostic tests to better understand the underlying condition.For instance, she may run blood tests or urinalysis, take X-rays, do an Doppler ultrasound exam of your legs, or run an ECG., Generally, your treatment will help with the underlying problem, not a drug specifically targeted at the swollen feet. However, sometimes diuretics can help bring the fluid down in your feet., Acupuncture is an ancient healing technique that originated primarily in China. It involves placing fine needles into specific energy points within the skin and muscle in an effort to reduce pain and swelling and stimulate healing.Acupuncture for swelling in the feet is not a commonly recommended treatment by mainstream medical professionals. However, if you've tried other treatments without success, then it's worth trying due to its relative safety and well-documented success with many other diseases and conditions.Acupuncture is now practiced by many more mainstream health professionals; whoever you pick should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine; people with this certification have passed an exam., Though not enough research has been done on this phenomenon, many pregnant have had good luck with water walking. It's likely that the pressure of the pool water on your feet helps reduce fluid in your legs, lowering swelling., A large vein, called the inferior vena cava, runs from the bottom part of your body up to your heart. By sleeping on your left side, your not applying as much pressure to it, and so it can properly circulate fluid., Sometimes cold compresses can help with swollen ankles while you're pregnant. Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel or even just a washcloth dipped in cold water. Don't leave it on for more than 20 minutes., That is, you can use compression stockings while you're pregnant to help control the swelling. Additionally, don't stand up too long; sitting with your feet above your chest is a better option while pregnant.Don't forget to include light exercising in your routine while your pregnant. You can try a daily walk to get your blood flowing."

One way to make this easier on yourself is to stock up on anything you might need during your recovery. Some things to stock up on include:food and beverages
toiletries
books
movies
over-the counter medicines, such as a gentle laxative and prescription or over-the-counter pain medicine;
, You will need to stay off of your feet as much as possible when you get home from surgery, so it is a good idea to get yourself set up ahead of time. Gather any items that you think you will want and place them near where you expect to spend most of your time as you recover at home, such as your bed or recliner.Think about what items you will want to have nearby when you return home from surgery. For example, you might want to have a stack of books by your side, or the remote control to the TV, or a backscratcher.

, Fewer obstacles will also make getting around your house much easier, so you might also want to rearrange some of your furniture before you head to the hospital.For example, you might consider moving a coffee table to the side of the room so that you do not have to walk around it. Or, you might consider moving your bed to the ground floor so that you don’t have to go up and down the stairs all of the time.

, When you are able to drive again, you will still want to stay off your feet as much as you can, so a handicap placard can be helpful. Apply for a handicap placard at your local DMV prior to your surgery. The placard will only be temporary, but it will ensure that you can park closer to entrances whenever you have to go somewhere., Even if you are well set up at home, you will still need to have some support from your friends and family while you recover. For example, you might need someone to pick up your mail, fill a prescription for you, or take you to a doctor’s appointment.Make sure that you let your family members and friends know that you are having surgery and ask if one or more of them would be able to help you out now and then during your recovery.

, Depending on the kind of foot surgery you underwent, your restrictions may be extreme or they may be relatively mild.


Your doctor has a vested interest in seeing you get better, so adhere to the limitations he or she sets.
The doctor may assign you specific tasks to aid in the healing of the surgery such as icing, elevating, or specific ways to clean the surgery site.
Call your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about the instructions he or she provided.

, The doctor will prescribe you medication to help you manage the pain you’ll experience after your foot surgery.Non-Opioid/non-narcotic pain relievers are often prescribed for small to medium levels of pain and are the safest form of prescription pain management.Common examples are ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen.
Opioid pain relievers are prescribed for medium to severe pain. Follow the doctor’s instructions specifically when taking opioids as they can be extremely addictive. Examples of opioid painkillers include oxycodone and hydrocodone., It’s normal for the surgery site or even your entire foot to swell in the days following your surgery, but there are things that you can do to reduce the swelling.


Use an ice pack or bag of ice to reduce inflammation. Be sure to place a towel between your foot and the ice and to check the skin under the ice regularly. Do not leave the ice in place for longer than ten minutes at a time.Do not place ice directly on top of the wound until it is completely healed.
Elevate your foot to combat swelling. Try to keep it about six inches higher than your heart., It’s important that you keep the area around the surgical incision clean, dry and protected.


Do not remove the bandages until the doctor has given you permission to do so.
Keep the bandages dry. You may want to wrap your foot in plastic to shower or take a bath with your foot out of the water. Ask your surgeon or podiatrist when it will be okay for you to wash the surgical site.
Do not put any creams, lotions or anything else on the wound unless as directed to do so by the doctor., It is not uncommon for patients to deal with constipation or other issues using the rest room for a few days after surgery.Make sure to stay hydrated to help your body stay regular.
Eat high fiber foods to combat the constipation effect opioid pain killers have.
Discuss the issue with your doctor if it continues for more than two days., Your doctor will want to see you regularly in the months after your surgery to ensure you are healing correctly.Don’t skip your post-surgical appointments as they are important to ensure your foot is healing as planned.
Bring up any questions or concerns you have regarding the progress of your foot to your doctor.

, After your surgery, you may be on crutches, in a cast, or specialized footwear. Depending on your surgery, your mobility may be significantly limited.


Your doctor will tell you if you are ready for any amount of weight bearing.Be patient, rushing to place weight on your foot after surgery could re-injure you.

, There are a number of possible complications that may result from foot surgery. If you notice symptoms of these issues arise, contact your doctor immediately.


Infection can be a risk early in your recovery. If you notice redness and warm swelling around the surgery site or are experiencing a fever you may have an infection.
Nerve damage is often not permanent, but you may experience numbness or tingling in the region surrounding the surgical incision. While it usually passes, you should discuss it with your doctor

, Your foot will need plenty of time to recover, be patient and follow the guidance of your doctor.


If you experience pain doing something the doctor has authorized, you may want to contact him or her to make sure you are not hindering the healing process.
Rest when you’re tired. Healing requires a significant amount of rest, so if you find yourself exhausted, it’s in your best interest to take it easy for a while.

, Your doctor may prescribe you physical therapy to help get you back on your feet.Physical therapy can help you recover sooner and with more success.
Physical therapists are trained to understand the limitations caused by your injury and devise exercises to help you regain your mobility.Physical therapy can also help manage pain resulting from the surgery.

, You may have trouble getting back behind the wheel again after your surgery. You should discuss any limitations you may have with your doctor.Do not drive while taking opioid pain killers as they can hinder your ability to drive in a similar way to alcohol.
Be careful using the foot you had surgery on when pressing pedals. Your doctor will be able to tell you if your foot can support the weight of pressing a clutch or gas pedal., When you can return to work will be determined by the nature of your surgery and what you do for a living. Regardless of timeframe however, be careful not to hinder the healing process.


Consider whether or not you will need to be on your feet for a significant portion of your day and whether your foot is healed sufficiently for that.Discuss your return to work with your doctor and your boss to ensure you’re all on the same page.
See if your work can provide you with temporary accommodations for the limits you experience while recovering."

Identify what the nature of your problem is.,
Plan what you're going to say.,
Make an appointment.,
Prepare any material you might need for the meeting.,
Explain your problem as clearly and honestly as possible.,
Listen to your counselor's advice.,
Be prepared for complex solutions.,
Thank your counselor after each session.,
Check if the nature of your problem is academic.,
Consider whether you need help with a school or college application process.,
Ask yourself whether your problem is of a more personal nature.,
Seek external help if needed.",How to Talk to a School Counselor," To help a school counselor advise you on a problem, first you need to make sure you are clear about what is the cause of the problem you're facing. Although a counselor's job comprises a broad range of aspects in a student's life, their main areas of advise are academic, career-related and social/personal problems. You should first determine which category your own issue belongs to.


Keep in mind that sometimes problems can affect more than one area of your life. For example, you might have trouble getting your homework done in time. Ask yourself whether this is due to poor organization skills, difficulty in understanding what is being asked of you, or some personal reasons that get in the way of your study, like family-related issues or lack of confidence.;
, Having a few questions prepared will make it much easier for a counselor to address your problem more accurately and help you develop strategies to cope with it.You can make a list of the problems and turn them into questions that you can ask your counselor. For instance, if you listed ""teachers don't get me"" as one of your problems, rephrase it into a question like ""How can I improve my communication with teachers?"", or ""How can I better explain teachers my problems with schoolwork?""

, School counseling is often offered as either one-to-one sessions or group sessions. Think of which one would work best for your problem and book an appointment as soon as possible, or check whether your school allows you to just stop by the counselor's office without an appointment. It's always better to start with a one-to-one meeting to get acquainted with your counselor and help him/her get to know you better. The counselor will determine whether what you need is individual or group counseling after meeting you in person.If you don't know who your counselor is or how to contact them, ask your teacher or an adult you trust at school. They will direct you to the right person. You don't have to get into the details of your problem, if you don't feel like it, but if you do, make sure they'll keep it confidential., If you go to the meeting without being prepared, it might give the impression that you're uninterested or make it much more difficult for a counselor to target your problem and find a solution for it.If you're seeing the counselor to discuss college admissions, it could be helpful for them to see your prospective college's application guidelines or highlight specific steps in the application process you haven't understood.

, Don't hold out on information that could help your counselor. The counselor will listen and offer either individual counseling or group counseling, or a combination of the two. If you don't know what the source of your problem is (school-related, family-related, personal), give your counselor a bigger picture of your life and they will help you figure out what it might be linked to.If you're unsure whether a piece of information could be useful or related to your problem, it's always best to say it. The more your counselor is told, the easier it will be for him/her to help you find a solution.
Don't feel guilty if you don't open up on everything on the first appointment. However, remember that the objective is to establish a relationship with your counselor based on mutual trust. A counselor will speak to you frankly and expect you to be just as upfront in expressing all of your concerns.

, Depending on what your questions are about, it may be helpful for you to carry something to take notes on. For example, college application can be a very elaborate process and you want to make sure you don't miss or forget any point and step you need to take.If you disagree with your counselor over something, don't hold it back. Tell your counselor you don't think their suggestion could work and explain why. Feel free to suggest other courses of action and discuss them. Saying yes to your counselor just to please him/her and then disregarding their advice won't be of any help!

, Counselors are not magicians who can solve any problem with the touch of a wand. Their job is to listen to you carefully, help you cope with a problem and find a solution, not give you ready-made solutions. This won't always be easy and will first of all demand your cooperation and active involvement.


For example, if someone bullies you, your counselor won't make this person magically disappear from your life. They will discuss the problem with you and suggest some strategies on how to deal with this person. Or, they might approach the bully themselves, a teacher or even your parents if you think that would help., Although helping you is the counselor's job, it's polite to show appreciation for their time and advice. Expressing your gratitude will build a stronger bond between you and your counselor.Being nice to your counselor can also help you in your long-term goals. For example, a counselor will play a large role in your college application process: having a relationship of trust and respect with him/her will make it much smoother., Counselors are trained to help you cope with any problem related to your school performance and provide guidance on study methods. Academic problems include:


improving your study skills
having troubles with some subjects
not knowing how to deal with a demanding teacher
being unable to keep up with your homework
having difficulties in reconciling schoolwork and leisure

, Counselors' original job was to advise students on how to best deal with admission procedures and increase their chances of success. Although their area of expertise is now much broader, this is still one of their main roles. Prepare clear questions like:


What classes do I have to take to enter college?
Do I have to take admission tests, and how can I prepare for them?
Are there any college handbooks that I can browse to help me make a decision?
Can I get in touch with former students who are now attending my prospective college?
What else can I do to prepare for college? , Remember that school-related or career-related problems, like not succeeding or having no idea what to do at college, could also be linked to personal problems and can better be solved if you address them at the source. Social or personal problems that your counselor can advise you on include:


being bullied by a schoolmate
having trouble making friends in a new school
lack of confidence
family issues affecting your school life (for example your parents' divorce)

, School counselors will do their best to help you on a wide range of issues. However, sometimes it's best to consult someone outside school, like a therapist, doctor or social worker, if your problem is not related to school or could be better solved by someone else. You can still make an appointment with your counselor and ask them whether he/she thinks you should seek external help. They will advise you on what is best to do.
Sometimes professional help can be combined: if you're going through a difficult time because of your parents' divorce and have trouble concentrating at school because of this, you can regularly see your counselor and a therapist at the same time. The counselor will help you not let this affect your academic performance, while the other will focus on your well-being and advise you on coping with your feelings about the situation.

Expect your body to start looking different.,
Understand that you will sound different.,
Prepare yourself for a different range of emotions.,
Expect changes in your social life.",How to Transition Into Becoming an Adult Male1," As you transition into a man, your body will react to having more male hormones. You can expect to grow facial and body hair. You might also notice that you develop more muscle in your arms, legs, and chest.As your body changes, you may feel self-conscious or begin comparing yourself to other adult males. Keep in mind that this is normal, but it is important work on building your confidence to help get you through this time.;
, As you transition into an adult male, your voice will likely deepen. On average, men’s voices are deeper than women’s voices. A change in hormones is responsible for this change as well., As you transition into an adult male, you will have a host of changes to your emotional range. You will be dealing with a lot of changes in your relationships, how society views you, and your hormones. All of these changes will play into your emotions and how you handle them.The increase in testosterone might increase your sex drive or cause you to become more aggressive.
Work on developing more emotional control to help get your through this time. You can use deep breathing, counting down from five, or taking a break from the situation to think and reflect on things before reacting.

, This happens because your relationships as an adult male will be different than your current relationships. There will also be different expectations from society. For example, society often expects men not to cry in public, although it is often acceptable for a boy or woman to cry. However, keep in mind that it is perfectly okay for a man to cry as well. You have the right to express your emotions no matter who you are or what stage you are at in your life.


Transitioning from adolescence to adulthood can be one of the most difficult transitions of your life because you may be searching for your identity.
Look for ways to be more independent, such as by taking on more responsibilities at home or finding a part-time job.
Be aware that you will be more prone to risky behaviors during this time. Work on developing your self-control to help counter these urges.

Examine other people’s motivations.,
Keep your cool.,
Convince your family you’re not a child.,
Take on new responsibilities.,
Treat others with respect.,
React with maturity.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Consider volunteering your time.",How to Stop Being Called a Child1," When somebody calls you a child, think about why they said it. Is it your physical appearance? Did you do something that would cause them to say it? Knowing why people perceive you as a child can help you work on looking and acting more mature. If you can't identify a reason, ask the person politely why they called you a child.


Don't get angry with them. Tell them that you are trying to act more grown up, and ask for advice. Say something like, “I know I’m younger than you are, but I’m trying to be more responsible and mature. Can you tell me why you still consider me a child?”
If you think you do know why someone called you a child, ask them to verify this. You may have assumed the wrong thing. Say something like, “Do you still consider me a child because of my age/appearance/way of talking?”
The person who thinks of you as a child may not be willing or able to offer you an explanation. Don’t let this bother you. Keep acting mature, and eventually, these people will see that you aren’t a child.The motivation for calling you a child may not have anything to do with you personally. They could be jealous, insecure, or want to hurt your feelings for other reasons.;
, Don't yell, cry, or otherwise react emotionally to someone calling you a child. This will make you look even more like a child to them. If you are mad, walk away, or if you think you can do so calmly, explain to them what bothered you. Think about whether it is worth potentially having an argument. In most cases, the best way to prove the person who considers you a child wrong is to not let their behavior bother you.Tears cannot always be helped. If you feel them coming on, excuse yourself. Step outside or to a quiet place to compose yourself. If you cannot walk away because you are at work or school, take some deep breaths. Try to change the subject. If you're still upset later, you can revisit the issue with the other person when you are feeling calmer.

, Possibly the most difficult people to prove your maturity to are those who see you on a daily basis. Your parents, siblings, and other family members may have known you your entire life, and it’s often just as difficult for them to start considering you as an adult as it is for you to accept them treating you like a child. That’s no reason to give up on acting more mature. Eventually, even your closest family members will see you as an adult.


Your parents may be the most difficult to convince you’re growing up. To them, you’ll always be their child, but your parents likely want you to be happy and more mature. Let them know how you feel about being called a child. Say something like, “I want to start acting more like an adult. It hurts my feelings when you call me a child. What can I do to make you think of me as an adult?”
Older brothers or sisters may also see you as still being just a child, and it can be difficult to get away from them since you’ll likely see them every day. This makes it even more important for you to remain calm. The best way to convince older brothers and sisters you’re not a child is to ignore them when they call you one. Don’t argue with your siblings about being a grown up. Just keep acting like one. They’ll come around.You can give evidence of why you think you are no longer a child. This can help convince your family to change their view of you. For example, you might say, ""I have a job and pay all of my own bills and rent. I think that means I should be considered an adult now.""

, Start by making sure you’re being responsible with all of your current activities. Don't forget to do your homework. If you're in a play, don't forget your script. Remember your clothes for dance lessons after class. If you’re already keeping up with all of your current responsibilities, consider taking on some additional responsibilities to show people you’re not just a child. This can include volunteering for a leadership position in a club or organization you belong to, doing more to help around the house, or getting a part-time job.


Don’t over extend yourself. Take on one new responsibility at a time, and once you’re sure you have it under control, you can consider other new responsibilities.
Choose new responsibilities that you care about. It will make the added work easier. For instance, if you enjoy theatre, volunteer to work as a stage manager. You may want to select responsibilities that contribute towards long-term goals. For instance, volunteer or find an internship in your field or industry.
Do whatever you can to not only complete your new responsibilities, but to go above and beyond to show you are committed. For example, if you need an event plan for a club you’re in charge of in place by next Friday, get it done this Friday., Even if you feel disrespected, treat other people with kindness and understanding. It may not always be easy when people are treating you like a child, but showing others respect, even when it’s unearned, is an important part of being an adult. Treating others with respect can be as simple as remembering not to demand or expect things from other people. Instead, ask for them, and say thank you.


Start small. Say please and thank you. These are two of the easiest ways to show your respect for others. Say things like, “Please pass the salt,” instead of, “pass the salt.” By adding please, you are asking instead of demanding. Always say thank you, if someone responds to your request.
Recognize other people are busy by saying something like, “I know you have a lot going on right now, but I would like to see a movie this weekend and could use a ride.” To express your gratitude, you can offer to do something in return.
Say, “I’m sorry,” if you upset someone. Don’t get defensive and argue. Instead, say, “I’m sorry I upset you. I didn’t mean to.”, For example, when you get a present you hate, don't make it obvious. Say thank you and put it aside. Keep it simple. If you get an ugly sweater for your birthday, say, ""Oh thank you, it looks really warm."" That's all. Don’t go on about how you can’t wait to wear it, as this may come back to haunt you when you have to wear the sweater every time you see the gift giver. If you receive a grade you’re not happy with, don’t storm straight up to your teacher’s desk and demand a better grade. Instead, take at least 24 hours, review any notes your teacher made, and calmly ask your teacher, “I was really surprised by my grade. Can we talk about it, so I can do better next time?”, One thing that many adults do that young people don’t is consider where they will be in a year, five years, ten years, etc. Consider long term goals and set achievable tasks that help you get there. This will show people in your life that you are serious about being more mature and making more adult decisions. Start small and build your way up to more advanced or long term life goals. Make a list of things you can accomplish in a day, a week, a month, etc., and keep track of your progress.


If you always procrastinate your assignments in class until the last minute, set a goal to finish your task a week early. Create calendar reminders or ask a friend or family member to hold you accountable.
If you want to attend a specific college, start finding out as much as you can about the college right away. Look up their application requirements, talk to a guidance counselor, and set up interviews at the school.Share your progress and accomplishments with family and friends along the way. This can help boost your confidence and motivation. It can also help others respect you more, which may help them see you as an adult. When sharing these accomplishments, try not to brag.

, Sometimes, working with others to achieve a goal or improve your community will help you better understand what you need to do to improve as an individual. This may seem strange, but getting outside of your own head and seeing the big picture is a great way to think and act more like an adult.If you are unable to volunteer for a charity or institution, you can make a difference by offering to help someone in your life. Try to give advice regarding things you have expertise, experience, or wisdom in.

There may be certain things that you have a natural aptitude for, or talents or skills you've spent years developing. Considering your strengths can help connect you to your passions and allow you to set personal goals.Is there anything that always came easily to you? Look back to your early childhood. Maybe you never had any interest in playing sports with the other kids, but would sit for hours drawing pictures during recess. Maybe you always aced math quizzes without much effort.
Consider things you seem to have a knack for, or that others have complimented you on. You may, for example, love taking pictures with your smart phone and uploading them on Instagram. You may get a lot of compliments on your pictures. You may benefit from pursuing photography more seriously. You could look into taking a photography class in school or at an art center.;
, Do not limit yourself as a teenager. Have fun and make the most of this time by exploring a variety of pursuits. Join many different extracurricular clubs. Look into taking classes in a variety of fields. On your own time, read about subjects that intrigue you, like art, history, science, and culture. You'll end up making great memories that will make your teenage years a valuable time of your life.It's okay if you try something and dislike it. Don't waste time doing something you hate. Stick to the pursuits that make you feel happy and inspired.
You'll also make friends while exploring your interests. Having a solid friend group will help you form lasting memories for your teenage years.

, Passions should make you feel excited and invigorated. Considering what inspires you in your day-to-day life can help you identify passions. Maybe you love reading about artists in class, and find going to art museums personally invigorating. This may mean you have a passion for art or art history. Spend your time pouring your energies into your personal passions.Conversely, think about things that rub you the wrong way. Oftentimes, feelings of jealousy or frustration with another person are rooted in your own insecurities. If you feel miffed that your cousin's piano recitals and plays get so much attention from your family, maybe you wish you were more creative yourself. You may want to consider pursuing theater or music to see if you like it.

, After you've spent some time considering your passions, set goals for yourself. It's important to have goals as a teen, as these can help shape the trajectory of your adult life. Writing down a variety of goals for a given year, semester, or summer can help you upgrade your life.

Start by writing down the abstract. Just jot down some ideas on where in life you want to improve. For example, you may write something like, ""I want to be a better writer.""
Try to narrow down your goals into concrete terms. How might you go about achieving some of your abstract goals? What small goals can you set along the way? For example, ""I want to write 20 pages by the end of the summer.""

, Specific and realistic goals work best. Passions and interests are often abstract, so when writing goals you should work on specifying how you want to pursue these things. For example, maybe you're interested in animal welfare. A goal like, ""I will avoid using products tested on animals,"" is a more specific goal than, ""I will do my part to end animal cruelty.""Set a series of specific and concrete goals that move towards a larger purpose. If you want to be a writer, you can set goals for how many books you will read each semester, and decide to write for a set number of hours each night.

, You want to share your teenage years with worthwhile people. Having a solid group of friends can help you learn and grow. Work on developing quality friendships that will raise your self-esteem. This way, you'll have a friends group you can share memories and experiences with as a teen.Your friends should be supportive of you. They should not tease or belittle you, and should encourage you to make good decisions. In turn, you should also be supportive of your friends' pursuits and interests.
The best way to find a friends group is to get involved. Join clubs relevant to your interests. Be social and make an effort to reach out to others. Having likeminded friends is important to upgrading your life as a teen.

, Not all relationships are positive. A friend should be supportive and caring. If someone in your life makes you feel bad about yourself, that person is probably not worth your time. You do not want your teenage years to be tainted with memories of bad friends and troublesome relationships.Watch for signs of abuse in a relationship. Abuse can be physical. You should not stay with friends who hit you, kick you, or otherwise physically harm you. However, abuse can also be emotional. It can come in the form of teasing, bullying, threats, or intimidation.
End relationships that are detrimental. Sever off contact with someone who is hurting you, physically or emotionally, and seek support from other friends or family members. Open up about what is going on so others can provide you comfort and advice.

, It's great to be open to trying new things as a teen, and important to making the most of your teenage years. However, you should not do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. True friends will not try to pressure you into doing something you don't want to do. Peer pressure comes in a variety of forms, and can create unnecessary stress and tension in your life. Know how to identify and avoid peer pressure.

You may be pressured to drink, smoke, or use drugs. Anyone who forces you into a situation that is unhealthy or dangerous is not a friend. You should look for friends who support you and understand your comfort zone.
Your friends may also pressure you to do things you're not interested in doing. It's good, to an extent, to have friends encourage you to try new things and overcome fears and insecurities. However, if you're truly uninterested in a given activity, your friends should respect your decision.
Peer pressure can also come in the form of excluding others. There may be a certain person in your friend's group who's being ostracized or left out. Do not participate in these kinds of tactics. Remember, you would feel bad if you were left out. You do not want to do the same to another person.

, During your teenage years, you may find yourself dating for the first time. Romantic relationships can be a great way to live life to the fullest and make your teenage years matter. You can learn a lot about yourself through dating. If you want to pursue romance, make sure your relationship is fun, healthy, and beneficial.You and your romantic partner should be able to share things. Find someone you can talk to and learn from. You should find a partner who makes you laugh and you genuinely look forward to seeing.
Romantic relationships do get physical. Many people experiment with sexual activity for the first time in their teenage years. It's normal to want a physical relationship. However, you should not engage in sexual activity until you feel ready and should always use birth control and condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs. If your partner pressures you, this is not a solid romantic relationship and you should get out.
Like friendships, romantic relationships can be abusive. Your partner should be supportive and loving. Anyone who harms you physically or emotionally is not worth your time.

, Grades are important to your success as a teen, and you'll actually find fulfillment if you pursue your intellectual curiosities. Work on maintaining a high GPA if you want to upgrade your life. Good grades can help you professionally and also help you learn about yourself and your passions.


Practice good study habits. Make sure you make a schedule for yourself in regards to your homework and studying for exams. Try to do your homework shortly after school. Work and study in a well-lit area free of outside distractions. Keep your laptop and cell phone powered down while you work.
If you're struggling with a specific subject, talk to your parents about hiring a tutor. You can also talk to your teacher and ask him or her how you can go about improving your grades in that subject.

, Experience is important for finding a job and getting into a good college. It's also important to making your teen years memorable and fun. Finding extracurriculars will help you live life to the fullest, in addition to upgrading your life via professional success.


Remember your goals and passions as you choose activities. If you're fascinated by journalism, join the student paper. If you want to work in science, join an after school science club. If you're working in areas you love, you're far more likely to have a great time during your teenage years.
Teenage years can help prep you for success down the road, so try to take on leadership positions when possible. Being the Editor-in-Chief of your school's newspaper is far more impressive than just being a writer.

, Volunteering can be a great way to bolster your resume, and you'll also build lasting memories. It can also help you pursue your passions and interests, allowing you to develop your character as a teenager. Volunteer for organizations you're passionate about. Look for local non-profits that accept volunteers. Volunteer to help out with events for your school. If you go to church with your parents, volunteer there. Work for a local political party.

, As you're pursuing jobs and internships, you'll end up getting a variety of interviews. Work on fostering good interview skills as a teen. This will increase your chances of landing a job or internship.

Make sure you dress the part. You want to wear something that looks professional. You should avoid jeans and a t-shirt, baggy pants, or gaudy jewelry. Strive for dress pants and a nice button down top instead. Make sure you wear appropriate dress shoes as well.
Research the company ahead of time. The more you know, the more invested you'll look in the job. Spend some time browsing a company's website prior to the interview.
Use your body language. Sit up straight and smile and nod to show the interviewer you are listening. Ask questions at the end of the interview. Choose open ended questions that show you're interested in the company. For example, ""What do you like about working here?"" or ""What's the company culture like?""

, A part-time job can be a great way to get some experience in when you're a teen, and many people bond with co-workers. Even a job like pizza delivery or working in a grocery store can provide fun and lasting memories. You'll end up meeting people your own age and developing a friend's group from work. Having some work experience can also help you down the road, as you prepare for college and later the work force.You can look on job boards online to find job leads. You can also ask around at local businesses. Look for help wanted signs in coffee shops and restaurants.
Talk to your parents, relatives, and siblings. They may know someone in your community who is looking for employees.
Try to find a job you feel like you would enjoy. You may not land a highly professional job as a teen, but look for work that you feel will be fun. If you love riding your bike, for example, consider a job as a bike delivery person.

, If you want to pursue success, you should write a resume. A resume is an overview of your professional experience, which you can use to apply for jobs and internships. Gaining some work experience in your teenage years can set you up for success later in life.Resumes are usually formatted using headers and bullet points to list work and educational experience. Formatting should be consistent throughout and you should use a font that's legible, like Arial or Times New Roman. It can be difficult to write a resume for the first time, so ask your school's guidance counselor for advice.
You may not have a lot of work experience as a teenager. That's okay. Many people hiring teens for jobs and internships understand a teen's experience is limited. List things like volunteer work you've done. If you've been part of a club or organization, list that as well. Academic success may reflect well on you if you're applying for an internship, so mention your GPA and whether you've been on the honor roll.

, Internships are a great way to bolster your resume. They can also provide you with lasting memories of your teenage years. A lot of internships are targeted at college students, but some businesses may offer internships specifically for teenagers.Internships provide hands-on experience working in an organization. As an intern, you'll start to learn the professional aspect of a certain industry. You'll be supervised by a team of professionals who will help you gain professional experience.
Ask adults you know, like teachers, parents, and school counselors, about where to find internships in your area. You can also browse job sites for internships. You can possibly create your own internship with a family member or friend's company.

, You should also work on preparing for college as a teen. Things like internships, jobs, volunteer work, and extracurriculars will set you up for future success career-wise. However, you should also work on researching colleges.


Look at colleges in and out of your state. Research a college's reputation, faculty, and culture. You want to find a university with a solid reputation where you feel you'll fit in.
Pay attention to requirements for college. Start thinking about how to get great standardized test scores so you can attend a top university.
Ask your parents if they'll take you to tour colleges. Seeing a college campus can help you decide if a given college is a good fit for you.

, You'll be surprised to find how much of your mood you can control. When you're a teen, you experience a range of powerful emotions. It's normal to feel sad and frustrated, and important to experience negative feelings, but you can also work on ways to feel happy and positive. This will allow you to better enjoy the experiences you have in your teenage years.Have a ritual you can engage in when you're feeling down. Maybe there's a TV show that makes you laugh. Maybe there's a song you like to listen to. When you're having a bad day, make a point of taking 15 minutes to yourself to cheer up.
Find ways to interrupt a bad mood. If you can't stop feeling down, do something to distract yourself. Play a video game. Read a book.
If you're feeling stressed in the moment, focus on your breath. Take a series of deep breaths, paying attention to the air going in and out of your nose and mouth. Focusing on the breath can keep you grounded in the present, preventing your stress from spiraling out of control.

, Exercising has a lot of benefits. Not only is it good for you physically, a regular exercise regimen can help elevate your mood. Regular exercise can help put you in a better mental state, allowing you to enjoy your teenage years.Pick a physical activity you genuinely enjoy. You're unlikely to stick to an exercise routine you hate. If you love your riding your bike, try to go for a two mile bike ride every day after school.

, Your teenage years are often a time of insecurity. You may be bombarded with a variety of negative thoughts throughout the day about yourself and your abilities. It's okay to feel bad sometimes, but you do not want negative thoughts to prevent you from pursuing certain activities and goals that allow you to thrive as a teen. Work on editing negative thoughts as they occur.Identify negative thoughts. Notice when you're feeling bad about yourself throughout the day. When you slip into a negative thinking pattern, make an active effort to resist and reframe your thoughts.
For example, you may see someone doing better than you at hockey practice. You may start to think something like, ""She's so much better than me. I'll never be as skilled. I should just quit."" Stop these thought patterns as they occur. Try to replace them with motivational thought. For example, ""She's a very skilled and inspiring player. I'm lucky to have her on my team. I'm sure she can teach something about hockey.""

, Everyone is good at different things. You may not have a natural aptitude for writing, but you may excel at science courses. You may not have a great brain for chemistry, but you may be a brilliant writer. Focus on what you're good at, and what you enjoy. You cannot succeed in everything, and that's okay. Pursuing what you're good at, and what you genuinely care about, will allow you to make the most of your teen years. You want to spend this time doing the things you genuinely want to do., Setbacks do not mean failure. The better attitude you have about setbacks, the more likely you'll be to bounce back and get on the road to enjoying your teenage years. If you slip up, accept that it's part of a larger learning process. Take rejection and set backs as an opportunity to learn and grow. If you didn't get a great grade on your chemistry quiz, take this as a chance to identify your weak spots for the exam. If you didn't get that summer internship, you can work on building your experience so you'll have better luck next time."

Become self driven.,
Set and achieve goals.,
Budget your money.,
Take responsibility for your actions.",How to Transition Into Becoming an Adult Male3," Adults, by nature, have to be more self driven than children. There isn’t always going to be someone there to guide you through the daily motions of life. You must find ways to challenge and motivate yourself in order to achieve your goals.For example, if you have a goal to eat healthier and exercise five times a week to lose ten pounds, you must find the motivation to do this yourself. Waking up forty-five minutes early to pack your lunch and take a jog shows that you are self driven.

, As you transition into adulthood you must learn to set short term and long term goals. These goals will help you stay motivated and self driven. Once you have set a goal, create a plan to achieve that goal.An example of a long term goal is getting a job as an accountant. Whereas a short term goal is enrolling in an accounting class.

, Managing your money is an important part of an adult male’s life. By creating a budget you can be sure that all of your bills are paid, maintain a good credit score, and hopefully even save money. A budget can be simple and does not need to be created by an expert.Create a list of all of your expenses. Keep in mind that bills are not your only expense. You also need money for food, transportation, clothing, etc.
In a separate list, record all of your income.
Be sure not to allow your expenses to exceed your income. If you have an excess at the end of each pay period, consider putting it into savings or investments.

, Everyone makes mistakes. Part of becoming a mature adult is taking responsibility for the mistakes that you make. By doing this, you will begin to win over the trust and respect of other adults. Own up to your mistakes and then do what you can to correct it.For example, you should admit to backing into your neighbor’s mailbox, even if nobody witnessed it. Inform your neighbor of your mistake and repair or replace their mailbox for them. This will show that you are taking responsibility and holding yourself accountable for your actions.

Develop a more advanced vocabulary.,
Write properly.,
Read about current events.,
Dress for success.,
Change your hair.,
Redo your room.",How to Stop Being Called a Child2," Avoid using a lot of slang terms or talking about things that may be considered childish. A great way to appear more mature is to expand your vocabulary. You can try things like getting a word of the day calendar, or simply challenging yourself to learn and use a new word everyday. However, the best way to improve your vocabulary may be reading more good books., When communicating in writing, use real words and full sentences instead of slang or IM and SMS shorthand. This looks much better to those who might read your work. If you’re sending a text message to one of your friends, you can probably still use shorthand, but if you’re texting or emailing a teacher or other adult, take the time to write out complete sentences and punctuate appropriately. If you’re writing a paper or other assignment for class, always use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.


Read through any writing before sending or submitting your written communication.
Ask a friend who makes good grades in English or who likes to read or write to review papers, assignments, or even emails that you want to sound mature.
Work on your spelling, grammar, and punctuation. If you are really struggling in these areas, ask your parents about seeking a tutor to help you write properly., This will help you vary your knowledge, so you can talk to others about a number of interesting topics. Many young people only talk about themselves, and this leads others to assume they are childish. However, if you can speak intelligently about what’s happening in your community or around the world, other people will begin to consider you as being more mature., Wearing clothes that are brightly colored, mismatched, or too casual can make you look like a kid. Choose a simpler look. Try a plain button up shirt and jeans or slacks instead of a t-shirt with a slogan on it. Wear clothes that are appropriate to your surroundings. For guys, wear a shirt and tie and nice pants, if you’re going to an event where you want to look your best. For gals, a nice skirt, dress, or pair of slacks and blouse will make you look more mature. Something as simple as tucking in your shirt can dramatically improve your overall appearance making you look neat and put together.You do not need to spend a lot of money to dress well. What matters is that your clothes fit you well and that they convey pride in your appearance.

, For guys, a shorter hairstyle can make you look more mature. Consider cutting your hair, using different styling products, or otherwise creating a more adult hairstyle. For gals, ditch the pigtails, brightly colored hair clips, and other youthful styles. Instead, wear your hair down or held back in a simple ponytail or bun. Whatever change you make, choose something that makes you feel comfortable.


Try to style your hair like your favorite celebrity or an adult in your life whom you respect.
Next time you go get a haircut, ask your stylist to help you choose something more grown up. You can also ask them for styling tips you can use at home., Make it clean and organized. Also if you have posters of Barney or High School Musical up, take them down or put them inside a closet or somewhere less obvious. If you have children’s furniture, ask about getting new things or save up your money to buy new furnishings. Sometimes, simply changing your bedding can make your room look more adult. Instead of having cartoon themed or brightly colored sheets and blankets, switch to a solid color.Declutter your home as much as possible. Donate books, clothing, and other items that you no longer use or need. The less you own, the easier it will be to keep your room tidy.

Address concerns with family.,
Talk to your coworkers or peers.,
Make unselfish decisions.",How to Stop Being Called a Child3," For many adults, issues of being treated like a kid start in the home. It's not easy to remind your parents, siblings, and other family members that you are no longer a child. If your family makes you feel like you're still a kid, ask to talk to them about your concerns. Discuss the issue in private, and ask your family members to take the problem seriously.


Say something like, ""I'm 30 years old. I have a steady job, and I maintain my own home. It really hurts my feelings when you treat me like I'm a child.""
If you've talked to your family in the past and they repeat their belittling behavior, remind them respectfully by saying something like, ""That is one of the hurtful comments I mentioned last time I was here.""
In some cases, convincing your family to treat you like an adult may be a losing battle, at any age. Continue to act like an adult, and hopefully, they'll come around.Often, it will take a series of repeated gentle conversations to get the point across. Try to redirect the conversation when it happens. Do not expect the issue to be fixed overnight.

, If you're being treated like a child in the workplace, you need to address the issue right away. This lack of respect may not seem like a problem at first, but you're much more likely to be overlooked when it comes time for promotions, leading a big project, or other responsibilities if coworkers see you as just a child. This is especially true if you allow them to treat you this way.


If a coworker is calling you a child or treating you like a child, ask to talk to them. Say something like, ""I've worked really hard to get where I am, and I don't appreciate it when you call me a child. What can I do to improve your view of me?
If a supervisor or boss is treating you like a child. Start by requesting a meeting. Ask your boss, ""Why do you call me a child? Is there something I can do to change your view of me?""
It's important for your supervisors to treat you like an adult, so if they are unable or unwilling to work with you, you may need to reach out to human resources or your boss' boss., As an adult, one of the easiest ways to show others your maturity is to consider the big picture when making choices. As an example, if you want to change jobs, take the time to consider the long term ramifications of your actions. Don't just quit your current job and hope a new one works out. Additionally, think through how your choice to change jobs will effect your family, your coworkers, and your business."

Become aware of what is passing through your mind.,
Be alerted when you find yourself dwelling on any one area.,
Consciously make a decision to 'still the noise' when you find yourself getting upset or agitated.,
Determine the relative 'temperature' of your thoughts.,
Ask yourself: Why I am repeating these negative thoughts?,
Consider how much time your thoughts are based in memory or future events.,
Monitor the events leading up to your current mental activity.

,
Remember that thoughts come and go; do not place unnecessary importance on them.

,
Focus your attention on what matters to you.

",How to Take Stock of Emotional Inventory," This is called 'mindfulness'. By finding mindfulness, you should be able to evaluate what you're thinking about in a nonjudgmental way. No thought you have is 'good' or 'bad', but it simply is. This mindset can cause you to see your thoughts aside from other's opinions on them. Your opinion on someone or something is your opinion, regardless of how they'd feel knowing you have it. Be conscious of the thoughts going through your head. When you feel a certain way, think about it and take a bit of time to evaluate what the thought is exactly. Don't let any thought pass by, but simply take time to comprehend it and move on.;
, As important as mindfulness is, you must be careful not to cope on one specific thing. It's important to move on and register other thoughts, as dwelling on a specific thought means you could invite negative emotions. Focusing on a specific thought often leads to criticizing it, which leads to criticizing yourself.

, Let your brain have a rest, and move yourself to an isolated area until you can begin to process the emotions you felt. Understand the root of what got you upset without judging those who were involved, the situation involved, or your actions. You are not evaluating the situation to place blame, but rather to find out why you're upset and reverse it. Isolating yourself from these thoughts and resting your mind through doing other things or a form of meditation is a healthy way to calm yourself down so you can revisit the event later.

, Think of your thoughts as a thermometer. If the thoughts are uplifting and help you feel hope or happiness in some way, leave them in your mind and focus on them. If they are 'cooler' and do not help you, ignore them and try not to focus on them. If this is not an option, simply isolate the thought as a 'just-is', and something that you cannot blame others or yourself for. Not everything needs or deserves a form of blame.

, Isolate them further, and understand whether or not your negative thoughts are repeating. Figure out whether there is a way that these thoughts are being triggered, and end it. negative thoughts only hurt you and upset your happiness. If the thought is a recurring thought about the future or something about your appearance or personality, find a way to be reminded of these things less and become more accepting of yourself and future. You are your own person with the power to change things, but you must first learn to love yourself. Simply loving yourself can destroy lots of negative thoughts.

, Try to focus your thoughts towards what is currently happening within a limited time span. Looking towards your future often causes you to see the faults in your future, and the same thought process goes with your past. It is better to think about what is going to happen soon, as you can therefore focus on your current happiness and the things you can change at that exact moment.

Spend a quiet moment alone.,
Do not compare answers.,
Visit a good friend.,
Avoid ruminating about your performance.,
Reward yourself for your hard work.,
For parents:

Avoid discussing the results: Discussions about the marks you expect your child to score can increase your worries, stress and anxiety levels.,
For students:

Engage in conversation while waiting for the results: Post-exam discussions and thinking about how you answered the questions can dent your confidence and cause you to worry.,
Exercise.,
Consider getting a massage.,
Eat a healthy, balanced meal.,
Recognize stress symptoms.,
Remind yourself of your positive qualities.,
Receive your results.,
Prepare for future exams.",How to Stop Stressing over Exam Results," After you finish taking the test, do not immediately talk to your friends about the test. Instead, take a quiet walk--outside if possible. Calm down and breathe deeply. Remember that you did the best you could in the present circumstances.


For example, say to yourself: I prepared as well as I could with the time and resources I had. I demonstrated the knowledge I hold in the present moment. I am proud of my work.;
, After you finish taking the test, do not ask your friends what their answers were. They could be wrong or right so comparison is not helpful. Additionally, you might stress over not matching their answers but be right all along.Instead, congratulate yourself for the things you did well and learn from the areas where you think you could have done better., After an exam, it is nice to meet with a friend, preferably not one who has taken the exam. Your friend can help support you and reduce your stress. You also can do a fun activity together that can take your mind off the test.When meeting your friend, agree to only discuss the exam for five minutes or not at all. It is important for you to release your stress rather than dwelling on the exam., Rumination means that you keep replaying or obsessing about negative situations.Unfortunately, rumination can lead to depression and anxiety.If you are ruminating about your performance, try the following steps:


Identify your fear. What scares you? Are you afraid of failing the test? Are you afraid your performance will impact your college entrance possibilities? Journalling can help you pinpoint your fear.
Ponder the worst-case scenario. Can you handle failing? Usually the answer is yes. Realizing you could handle the worst-case scenario removes the power from your initial worry.
Realize what you cannot control. You cannot control your results. Stop trying.
Turn mistakes into learning moments. Maybe you did not write your essay well. What can you do to improve? If you're in university, visit the writing center. Additionally, you could check out books on how to write essays. You also could ask your teacher for feedback.
Practice mindfulness. Try to keep your mind in the present. Look around you while you walk (versus at your smartphone). Breathe in the scents.
Try therapy. If you find yourself ruminating without stop, see a counselor. Counselors can help you learn additional strategies to stop rumination., After the exam, do something you enjoy. This will help take your mind off the exam. Visit a favorite cafe or shop. Alternatively, you could take a relaxing walk or buy yourself a treat. You also take a soothing bath or read a non-academic book., It can also make your child feel that you will love and value him only if he meets your expectations.
Don’t have unrealistic expectations and don’t be over-excited: Although your child may be good in studies, the fact is, not every child can be a topper. So, don’t get over-excited by expecting your child to be among the toppers. It is okay if your child secures good marks, as academics is one of the many facets of life.
Stop worrying about social norms and expectations: Your child’s exam results do not define your social status or standing in the society. So, don’t fret and worry about what your friends and relatives will say if your child doesn’t score well.
Don’t indulge in comparison: Don’t compare your child with his peers, or his own achievements of the current year with previous performances to come to a conclusion about the marks he may obtain.

, In such a situation, instead of keeping your fears to yourself, try to speak with family members or friends about how you are feeling. Don’t be embarrassed to tell them the causes of your distress. In case you don’t feel comfortable revealing your feelings to others, you can seek help from numerous online resources.
The day prior to the announcement of the results: Stress levels are highest on the day before, and the few hours prior to the announcement of results. During this period, avoid taking stimulants like coffee or energy drinks, which can increase the stress level. Also, try to stay away from social media and other sites where there is a lot of excited discussion about results, as reading what others say may sometimes perturb you. Read your favourite book, watch a movie, go for a walk or engage in some physical activity to take your mind off the results and relax.
If things don’t go as planned: ‘DO NOT PANIC’. Scoring low marks is not the end of the world. You can appear in exams again the next year and achieve a better result. Speak to your parents and teachers, or those you confide in, and find out what you should do next. There are many famous achievers who didn’t succeed in their first attempt, but that did not dishearten them. They kept trying until they succeeded. So, motivate yourself and pull up your socks for a better result the next time.

, Take a brisk walk or jog. Consider swimming. Exercising is not only helpful for your physical health; it also can reduce stress. Doing some form of low to moderate intensity exercise can reduce fatigue, improve alertness and concentration, and enhance overall cognitive function. This is very helpful after an exam when stress has depleted your energy. As few as five minutes of aerobic exercise can stimulate anti-anxiety effects.When stress affects the brain, with its plentiful nerve connections, the rest of your body feels the impact. If your body feels better, your mind will as well. Physical activity produces endorphins, chemicals in your brain that act as natural painkillers. Exercise also helps you sleep., After an exam, it is very possible that your back and neck will be sore from studying so much. Getting a massage can relax your muscles, calm your mind, and also produce endorphins. You can visit a massage therapist or ask a friend to give you a back rub. Acupuncture is another option for relieving stress and producing endorphins., After a stressful exam, you might be tempted to celebrate with pizza or ice cream. Unfortunately, high-fat foods will make you feel tired and less able to cope with stress. Plus, because stress can increase your blood pressure and raise cholesterol levels, high-fat foods will make your body feel worse. To prevent stress, your body needs a balanced, healthy meal. Low-fat meals with high fiber, rich carbohydrates, and many fruits and vegetables are best. They will calm you and supply nutrients to strengthen your immune system.Good food choices would be:


High-fiber, carbohydrate-rich foods. Carbohydrates cause your brain to produce more serotonin, a hormone that relaxes you. Consider baked sweet potatoes, minestrone soup, or sautéed vegetables over rice.Sushi also is a fun, healthy option.
Fruits and vegetables. High stress can weaken your immune system. Have you ever noticed that you get sick around exam time? Stress could be a factor. By increasing your consumption of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, you can boost your immune system. Healthy choices are acorn squash and carrots or citrus fruits., Sometimes, despite trying your hardest to stay relaxed, you might still feel stressed about your results. If this is the case, talk to a trusted adult or counselor about your feelings. Ask about ways to reduce your negative feelings and stress. Symptoms of stress include:


Sleeplessness
Fatigue
Forgetfulness
Unexplained aches and pains
Poor appetite
Loss of interest in activities
Increased anxiety and irritability
Increased heart rate
Migraines or headaches
Blurred vision
Dizziness, Our brain has a negative bias. This means it tends to have greater activity when we are thinking about negative things. Depressing thoughts can impact our mood more than positive thoughts.To prevent negative thinking, make a list of all the things you like about yourself. What do you do well? What do you enjoy? How are you a nice person? By considering the positive things about you, you will begin to feel better.

, When you receive your results, take deep breaths. If you did as well as you wanted, celebrate. If you feel you could have done better, there are many ways to improve. Remember, your test results do not define who you are or how valuable you are as a person. They are a marker of one day’s performance in your life.


Stay calm. Remember that while your exam results are important, you always have additional options. You might be able to retake the exam. If the exam is part of a class, there might be other tests or papers that contribute to your grade. Putting your test in perspective can help you relax.

, If you performed well, repeat the same study techniques for your next exam. If you did not score as well as you hoped, be proactive for the next exam. First, think about how you prepared for this exam and what you could do differently. Consider the following alternatives:


Talk with your instructor. Ask him or her what you could do better next time. Your teacher will have insight into your strengths and weaknesses.
Hire a tutor. If you need to take this or a similar exam again, consider getting professional help. Having personalized attention can improve your confidence and and help you learn more quickly.
Start a study group. If there are other people taking this exam again, consider studying together. Pool your study books and flashcards. Quiz one another. Having peer support can make you feel less overwhelmed.
Ask a parent or friend to help you study. If you need a study partner to quiz you, ask a parent or friend to help. They can do flashcards with you or ask you to explain essay answers.

Create an image for yourself.,
Do your chores.,
Respect your parents.,
Find a person who is like you.,
Find a selection of music that describes you.,
Be yourself.,
Realize nothing is perfect.,
Have a circle of close-knit friends.,
This is best for people who feel as though life has nothing to offer them and that it sucks, and for people who have chronic depression and who are going through a so-called ""phase"".",How to Survive the Rough Patch As a Teenager," This doesn't mean that sappy stuff that adults talk about like your self image, respecting your elders and being presentable. It means take a look at your perspective on things and make a statement. Look at where you stand in your opinions. In a way, think more closely about the things you do every day, and analyze what you do. You should soon discover that you, as well as everyone else is very hypocritical.;
, No one earns respect by being lazy. Although this is not just talking about doing the dishes, and cleaning your room, it means chores outside of your living accommodations. If your friend needs a favor and you are able to help them, then you probably shouldn't say, sorry, I can't help you right now. Even though it may seem like a good decision at that moment, being a person who only takes and never gives back isn't a very good image.

, Even if they have done some cruddy things in the past, hating them isn't going to change one thing. And its also possible to hate and still respect at the same time, and most of the time, little things that children say to their parents goes a long way. Many time words can be more hurtful than actually hits. But you can show your love to your parents by thanking them when they do nice things, helping them out sometimes and even just giving hugs or compliments. Actions go a long way.

, Someone who has many things in common with you, someone who understands what your going through and who understands how you live. It is much easier in this world with a little support from someone other than your parents or family members. No matter what race, gender or color they are, all that should matter is their personality and how they are as a person. Even if your parents hate you for dating ""outside your race"", you should always live for you and you alone. Because in the end, its your life, not your parents and not your family's. Yours and you live it the way you want.

, Its sometimes a good idea to have lots of different genres, that way you can have music for every mood. You don't have to listen to rock just because your friends listen to rock. Listen to what you want to listen to, because no one is inside your head except for you. Live for you.

, Don't be a push over, don't think you better than anyone else, because were all equal. Try not to judge because you probably wouldn't want to be judged and you don't know what is going on in that person's life. And most importantly don't let anyone crush your spirit or soul, be strong and stand up for yourself. But that doesn't mean fighting, you can resolve conflicts the ""mature and adult way"". Talking it out.

, Nothing in this world is perfect, neither are you. When something defeats you, don't cry and whine, don't give up and quit. Try again and give it your all, because at the end of the day, you have to live with your actions.

, One where everyone is close with everyone, there are many secrets and everyone in that circle knows them. The circle is made up of people whom you can trust and people that have your back no matter what. You would do anything for them and vice versa.

, Just know that the grass is greener on the other side. Keep hope and don't give up, because everything happens for a reason. Suicide is never the ideal way to go.

It means taking care of yourself and respecting that you are a precious being like everyone else. Look for things you like about yourself. Whether you are looking in the mirror or just thinking about your personality, focus on the positive.
Be kind to yourself. Do something you enjoy or eat a special meal once in awhile.
Be proud of your personality and preferences. From nerd to jock, from athletic to bookworm, you are unique and it's important to honor the expression that fits you rather than squeezing yourself into someone else's expectations.;
, Your main responsibility as a teen is probably schoolwork. While there are many social and emotional distractions, remember that your education is meant to help you in the future.


Develop good study habits. Long hours of study don't necessarily show results unless you're studying wisely. Study in a place where you will be most productive and with minimal distractions. Use flashcards, memory games, or review sheets to reinforce new information. Remember to take breaks and stay positive!, Keep your mind and body active by eating healthy foods every day. Your body is still growing, and you need to nourish it along the way. A balanced diet includes a large number of vegetables, fruits, proteins, and grains. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and sweets. Remember to eat your three meals per day, especially breakfast. Do not overeat. Overeating, especially eating junk foods, can cause health problems in the future. If you have a problem with overeating or weight gain, seek help from a doctor or nutritionist.
Do not starve yourself. Skipping multiple meals to lose weight is a sign of anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is a serious eating disorder that poses many health risks. If you or someone you know struggles with anorexia, seek counseling immediately.Bulimia nervosa is another common eating disorder, especially among teenaged girls. Bulimia is characterized by overeating and then rushing to a bathroom to vomit all that was consumed. This, too, is a psychological disorder that requires serious attention. , Teenagers should for about one hour per day. You may have to participate in a physical education class at school, but there is more fun to be had! Adding a physical activity after school can nicely balance out your day. Search for an activity that suits your interests. Consider joining a sports team or taking a dance class. Any type of body movement will decrease your chance of suffering from ailments in the future. Exercise also releases a chemical in your brain called endorphins. Endorphins will keep you in a positive mood!

, Between school, homework, extracurriculars, and socializing, it can be a challenge to get enough rest. A healthy amount of sleep helps with performance at school, social interactions, and the ability to handle stress. Make an effort to sleep for at least eight to ten hours each night. Develop regular sleep patterns. Research shows that teens often develop irregular sleep patterns like staying up late during the week and sleeping in on weekends. This irregularity can cause poor sleep quality in the long run., There are a number of steps you can take when you're feeling overwhelmed by emotion. Here are some suggestions for how to cope with a feeling that makes you upset:

Name the emotion. Think about your emotions and try to name them. Say, ""I'm feeling jealous right now,"" or ""I feel sad, but I'm not sure why.""
Write about the emotion. In your diary or even in a note on your cell phone, write down the emotion, how you're feeling, and what's going on in your life.
Understand the circumstances behind a feeling. What caused you to feel this way? Was it unexplained, or did something happen in your life to cause this emotion?
Calm yourself down. Whether you want to take a walk, call a friend, do some deep breathing, or watch a funny cat video, find a way that helps you become less distraught and overwhelmed.

, Find some activities that you enjoy. This will give you something to look forward to during the day. Your school or community may offer fun evening classes. Try joining a chess club or taking a cooking class. , Make the most of your teen years. Enjoy life while you are young and have fewer responsibilities. Teenage years might be rough to handle, but it's quite possible that you will miss this carefree and youthful time once you're older.

, Your peers have hopes, worries, and fears, just as you do. They have an urge to do something useful in the world, just as you do. Some are nice, caring, and supportive, and will understand you. Those who aren't very friendly may have reasons for that. They may feel shy, scared, or annoyed at the world. It's important to realize that people can be mean because of insecurities or a desire to keep pain at bay. Don't assume the worst in others.


Put yourself in your peers' shoes. This may help you understand others better. For example, if you notice that someone never seems to do well on tests and is always in a bad mood in class, try to imagine how you would feel in that situation. You may also feel frustrated in an environment in which you do not succeed.

, Making friends can be challenging, especially at a new school. Be open to talking to new people. Ask questions about them and share interesting things about yourself. It takes time to make close friends, but the more time you spend together, the closer you will become. Join a club or activity. Go with a new friend or show up by yourself. Either way, you are bound to spend time with people and build friendships.

, Friendship and socializing are an important part of being a teen. Maintain friendships that make you feel supported and comfortable in your own skin. Supportive friends will encourage you to be the best version of yourself. Avoid friends who pressure you to do things that don’t feel right for you.


Good friends spend time together, they help each other, and they can trust each other. For example, a good friend will enjoy going to your house or seeing a movie on the weekend. He or she will be glad to help you with your homework if you are struggling. A good friend will listen to your problems and won’t talk about sensitive issues behind your back.
Maintain friendships by making an effort to see each other. Sit together at lunch or join the same club. If you don’t go to the same school, call each other on the weekends. Send updates via email or text during the week to show that you want to stay in touch.

, Peer pressure is when you are influenced to do something because your friends are doing it or because your friends ask you to participate. This can have both a positive and negative effect. Before making a move, think about if it is right for you. What are the possible outcomes? What is the best or worst thing that could happen?Don't do something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Use some non-confrontational phrases if you are pressured to do something that you know feels wrong. Try saying, “Hey, I don’t think I want to get into this. It’s just not for me.”

, Getting along with parents can be challenging as a teen. Try doing an activity together that you both enjoy. Play a sport or watch a movie together. Help out around the house or offer to drive your siblings somewhere. Parents will appreciate it when you make an effort to help them. Helping out also shows maturity and can help build trust between you.


Avoid ugly fights. Parents also struggle with adolescent years. They may try to restrict your actions or shorten the time spent with your friends. Try to reason with them logically instead of yelling to get what you want. Compromising with your parents is valuable skill to develop.

, People often start dating in their teens. There can be a lot of pressure to have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Families differ on what is appropriate as far as dating. If you are interested in someone, try getting to know them to test the waters. See if going on a date is appropriate and mutually desired.


Engage in safe sex. Not all teens are ready for sex. Avoid people who pressure you into having sex if you wish to abstain. If you do feel ready to have sex, be aware of the physical and emotional consequences. Sex can be fulfilling, but it can also be an emotional burden at a young age. Additionally, sex can result in the passing of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that compromise your health. Sex can also result in pregnancy. Always use condoms correctly when engaging in oral, vaginal, or anal sex.
Make sure that you and your partner are respectful and loving to one another. Your partner should never be physically or emotionally abusive, and you should never feel that your partner has any control or power over you. Read this article to see if your relationship could be categorized as abusive.

, Social life is challenging at any age. Develop a healthy sense of self to get through difficult situations. Remember to focus on the positive aspects of who you are and avoid criticizing yourself. Brush off awkward mistakes. Mistakes are lifelong occurrences. If you feel you’ve embarrassed yourself, don't freak out or overreact. Just be calm. Most people are thinking about themselves anyway. There are many ways to deal with embarrassment.

For example, if you fall in the cafeteria or make a bad joke, try laughing it off. You might say, “Oh, that was weird” and keep moving. You also might be overestimating how much people are actually looking at your or paying attention to you. It's possible that no one even noticed that you fell in the cafeteria, and your bad joke will probably be forgotten by the end of the day.

, Teens are often exposed to drugs and alcohol at some point. There is a lot of peer pressure to participate in drinking and drug use. Unfortunately, these tend to have very negative consequences, especially when used at a young age. Avoid drugs and alcohol. Recreational drug use is illegal, and it is illegal for teens to drink alcohol. Do not over-consume. If you are going to drink alcohol, be careful not to binge drink. This is when you drink a large amount of alcohol (about three to four drinks) in about an hour. This will raise your blood alcohol level and can be very dangerous, resulting in hospitalization and even death. Learn your facts. If you do use drugs, know the effects, side-effects, likelihood of addiction, and risks involved. Many drugs are illegal because they can be highly addictive and result in deadly overdose. , It happens that some people thrive on it. It's usually a waste of time and tends to feed off negative emotions. Conflicts are a normal part of life. Drama, however, arises when people make a big scene about their emotions instead of handling the situation in a calm and private setting. Avoid getting caught up in the he-said-she-said fights and turning everything into a huge deal.


Don't gossip about others. Gossip can lead to drama as well. Gossiping or talking about someone behind their back leads to a lot of rumors and hurt feelings. If you have an issue with someone, it is best to speak with that person directly. If you are not involved in the situation, avoid the temptation of spreading erroneous information.

, The internet brings a slew of positive and negative things. Be careful with the information you share with people online or via text.


Remember that anything you send to someone can be saved and re-sent to a third party. Don’t share anything you wouldn’t want your friends, family, and teachers to see.
Do not give out personal information online. Remember that people with bad intentions are looking for chances to take advantage of you via the web.
Never meet someone in person that you first encountered on the internet. This is quite dangerous because many people pretend to be someone they are not. Reserve your in-person interactions for people you actually know from daily life.

, If you are dealing with serious problems like depression, abuse, or any sort of health risks, find a therapist or talk to school counselor. Even if your problem seems small, a school counselor should be available to have a talk with you.

Identify what you are rebelling against and why.,
Understand that you are most likely embarrassing your children.,
Realize that you no longer have to “fight the man” because most likely you actually are ""the man”.,
Embrace this new era in your life where you can be confident about who you are and celebrate the accomplishments you’ve achieved.,
Consider other productive ways you could be using this rebellious energy.",How to Stop Being Rebellious in Your 40s," In some cases you may be passively aggressively rebelling against a dead end job or a lifeless marriage. Before you can really stop being a “Rebel without a Cause” you need to know what are you fighting for?


Political issues. Feel an affinity with the Occupy movement and are ready to stand outside the biggest bank in town and have a fit? Before you pitch that tent and stock up on bottled water, decide if this is the best strategy for you and your family in order to let the government know how you feel. Now that you are in your 40’s you most likely have connections and insight into how politics works in order to be more effective in getting your voice heard. Sometimes the pen (or email in accordance to today’s standards) may work a little better.
Family members. Still wanting to shock mom with outrageous clothing or crazy behavior? At this point mom is no longer shocked, she’s embarrassed and most likely considering professional help for you. You are an adult now, act like one.
Your lifestyle choice. If you found that marriage and raising a family is hard and don’t want to be the picture of “June Cleaver” you have to realize that how you “look” isn’t nearly important as the influence you have on your children and the support you provide to your spouse. Who cares if you live in the suburbs and no longer dwell in an artist’s studio downtown? Your role is far more important today than it was 20 years ago when you were a hipster.
Your boss. Career suicide is no way to rebel--ask Mel Gibson how that’s working out for him. In fact, if you start rebelling at work (like a young 20 something Peter in Office Space) you may indeed end up in that prison he ultimately avoided (thanks to a fire). Instead of having a tantrum at work, consider empowering yourself to change jobs or careers. Rebelling at work in middle age will only give you a one-way ticket to the unemployment line. Trying to match the same salary and position at your age may not be as easy as it was when you were in your 20’s.;
, Although it was probably pretty darn cool to be a rebellious, passionate young person, a rebellious middle aged person is not very sexy. Although you may feel as though you don’t care what people think, you should be extremely aware of how your behavior is impacting your kids. Courtney Love’s estranged child Frances Bean now refers to her mother as her “birth mother” and has begged her to get help numerous times.


They may be teased at school. Think you are being the “cool” parent? Instead you may be coming off as the embarrassing parent because you act differently and rebelliously. Kids pick up on parental behaviors and sometimes may find ways to single each other out and use that difference as leverage for teasing and even bullying.
Your family’s credibility with teachers and administrators may be diminished. If your child’s teacher or school principal doesn’t believe that you are serious parent you may be missing out on opportunities for your child.
They may be dealing with their own feelings of rebellion and possibly feel as though they cannot fully express themselves because of your actions. You can’t have an entire family of rebels so your children may have to take more of the parental role as you act out.

, By the time you hit middle age, you may have made headway in your career or chipped away at a few goals. Back in when you were in your 20’s you had to claw and fight your way to the top in order to prove yourself. Now you just may be there.


Don't be ashamed that you’ve “gone establishment.” Part of young rage against the establishment is due to jealousy that upper management or the boss seems to have all the controls. You know by now what you had to do to achieve your goals. Don’t be embarrassed, but instead embrace your accomplishments.
Avoid being the “cool” boss in order to gain acceptance with the younger set. Being approachable and acting as a mentor to younger staff members is great, however don’t sacrifice any accomplishments in order to be accepted on the same level as your younger cohorts.

,


Understand that attitudes about life change as people age. It doesn’t mean that you’ve become “weak” or “soft” but that instead you’ve gained wisdom and insight into how to best expend your energies. Tap into this inner power and use it to fight smarter not harder.
Know that some battles are not worth fighting. Life lessons will most likely teach you that some fights are worth putting in the effort, whereas others are better left alone. During your 20’s you may have been outraged and pushed back against just about everything ranging from disdain against eating meat to foreign affairs, however now that you are in your 40’s some of those vocally fought battles may not worth your time and effort.

, Perhaps your passion is saving animals or politics--by the time you reach your 40’s you may now have the voice and the power to actually stop rebelling and actually do something with your passion.


Understand that some rebellious behavior can be self-destructive. Know that your behavior most likely does not only negatively impact your life but your immediate family, including children.
Evaluate if your efforts are producing results. If you are rebelling just for the sake of rebelling, it must be quite tiring. Instead of banging your head against the wall, change your approach and try another way to follow your passion.

Doing this helps you motivate yourself because you can feel successful every day., Use a calendar or planner to mark your due dates. Make sure these deadlines are realistic and update them as necessary if you discover they will take more time.Each time you succeed at a small goal, your brain releases dopamine, the “feel-good” chemical in the brain, making you want to achieve more!Mark these victories as you achieve them on your schedule.
Don’t forget to schedule free time too! You can’t work constantly and stay focused, so add a short break every day for doing something fun or relaxing.

, The best way to reach your dreams is to get guidance from someone who has accomplished something similar.

Rewrite your goal every day.,
Do something towards your goal every day.,
Create an organized workspace.,
Clear out distractions.,
Take regular breaks.,
Reward yourself for each success, no matter how small!",How to Stay Focused on Your Dreams (for Teens)2," Writing stuff down is actually part of the mental process for committing to a goal, so write your dream down every morning. Doing this will remind you why you are going to try your best each day to keep up with your deadlines.
Keep a dry erase or chalkboard next to your vision board to rewrite your goal every day. You don’t have to keep it since the process is what is important.
Get different colors and take a few minutes to write it nicely, and differently from the day before, so that it catches your attention when you pass by it.

, Look at the nearest deadline you made on your calendar and decide on 1-3 things you can do today to work towards accomplishing it.Don’t overwhelm yourself with more than a few daily goals. One is ideal; three is the maximum.
Don’t take even one day off from working on your goal. Do something to keep it at the top of your list so you don’t lose momentum.If you are on vacation, etc., and just can't actually work on your goal, at least take a few minutes to think about it and plan for when you return home.

, You can’t stay on task if you can’t find needed supplies. Set aside a place just for working on your dream and gather what you will need to achieve daily goals. This may be a desk, a space to practice, or any other area specific to your long-term goal.If your dream is to be a professional athlete, find a quiet and appropriate place to practice.
If your chosen sport is a team sport, find a gym or arena you like to practice in and figure out the best times to go.
If you are heading towards a career in writing or research, set up a study area in your house with a desk, a comfortable chair, a bookshelf, and a computer, if needed.
If your dream is to be an artist, set aside a space to create art. Gather the supplies you will use most: paints, pencils, paper and/or canvas, any tools you like to use when making art.

, Play background music only if it is conducive to you working. Turn off the television, or better yet, don’t include a TV in your workspace at all.Ask family and friends not to interrupt you, and put your phone on silent.


If your dream requires writing or reading, or other skills that require steady concentration, you should be able to work smoothly through any background noise without being distracted by it by lyrics or dissident tones.
Try classical music, or jazz, or make up a playlist with songs that you know well and aren’t easily drawn into singing.
If your dream requires practicing physical efforts everyday, choose music that motivates you to work harder. You might listen to dance or pop music with lyrics about achieving goals and working hard to get what you want, for example.

, You need a 15 minute break every 45 minutes to stay sharp and focused on the task at hand.Use your break to get up and move around, if your work requires you to sit, or to sit and relax, if your work is primarily physical.



Start a meditation practice.This is not only a great way to change tasks and refresh your mind, but also keeps your brain more focused throughout the entire day.
Athletes might use break time to rest and rehydrate with some water while watching video of professional performances.
If you practice inside, go outside for your break to get a change of scenery, and vice versa.
If you are working inside while sitting for long periods, you might get up and take a dance break or complete a short chore.
If you have a pet, play with them for 15 minutes for stress relief and fun. Take your dog for a short walk or grab a piece of yarn to play with your cat.

, Set up rewards for each task or part of your plan that you complete and/or for meeting timed goals.Sometimes your best might be doing your work for the day even though you don't want to. Reward yourself for overcoming the urge to procrastinate!
Rewards can be monetary, free time to spend how you like, or anything else that makes you happy. It’s up to you!
Make sure you aren’t spending out of your means, or scheduling too much free time to be able to meet your next deadline on time!
Be careful about using food and drinks as rewards. A piece of expensive chocolate is a great reward, but rewarding yourself every day with a kind-size candy bar is not good for your health.

Learn to work through boredom.,
Visualize working on your goal for motivation.,
Resist the urge to multitask.,
Don’t procrastinate.,
Surround yourself with like-minded people.",How to Stay Focused on Your Dreams (for Teens)3," Find a way to love the process of working on tedious tasks that must be done daily in order to reach your overall goals.There are always tasks like these, whether it is practicing the same moves over and over again, researching topics for your writing, or doing the same math problems multiple times until you get them just right.
Find something within these tasks that you enjoy doing or that makes you feel good, and focus on that aspect instead of the boredom of repetition.

, Visions boards are great tools because they keep you reminded of what you really want and why you should keep working hard to get it. But if you aren’t standing in front of it, use your imagination to find the motivation to get through your daily task.


Be specific with your visualizations, though. Instead of daydreaming about a far off future, in which you have your dream career, visualize yourself actually doing the nitty-gritty work.Picture yourself doing what you need to get done today, and how you will feel after it’s done, and then you will likely be ready to get to work.
If this doesn’t get you moving, remind yourself of your reasons for wanting your dream. Look at your notecards or vision board for all the specific reasons why your dream is important to you.

, Multitasking is not really a great way to get things done and do them well. You will complete each task much more proficiently and completely if you focus on one at a time. Dividing your attention with too many tasks is as distracting as TV or loud music can be.If you are writing a story or report, break the task up into sections and complete one at a time.
Athletes should concentrate on learning one skill or move at a time.
Artists usually work with one medium at a time. Complete your under-drawing before you start opening paint
Trying to do them all at once can get confusing and switching back and forth between tasks makes them all more difficult

, This is the work thing you can do when trying to work towards a large goal. Plan out projects and tasks way in advance of your deadlines for completing them, and plan a work schedule if necessary, to determine how much time it will really take to do these tasks well.Figure out your personal procrastination style to find out how best to avoid your triggers.For example, some people procrastinate by watching TV or another leisurely activity, while others put off important work to do chores that can really wait until another day.
Set up time in your schedule for goofing off or surfing the internet if you know these are big time wasters for you.
Giving yourself permission to do the things you enjoy while limiting the amount of time you can spend doing them is often far more productive than trying to avoid these time spenders completely.
Find tips to stop procrastinating online, but actually use them to see benefits, and limit the amount of time you spend looking for them.

, Whether they share the same or similar goals, or encourage you to reach yours, identify those people in your life that make you want to be better at what you do and spend as much time with them as possible.You don’t need to stop hanging out with friends who don’t want to do the same thing you do after high school, but make sure your friends have goals of their own and support you in yours.The people you spend the most time with should make you want to be a better version of yourself, not make you wish you were someone else.
Look for positive supportiveness and sincerity rather than non-constructive criticisms in your chosen peers.

This means making sure your body and face are clean, your teeth have been brushed and flossed, and you are wearing deodorant so you smell fresh. You should always shower once a day and take time in the morning to look presentable before you step out into the world.


You should also take some time to do your hair by ensuring it is brushed and looks clean. Use styling gel and styling tools to tame your hair so it compliments your overall look. Being mature about your appearance will show others that you care about how you look and want to be taken seriously.;
, If you turn up to work in a crumpled t-shirt, ripped jeans, and flip flops, you may appear immature or inappropriate to your co-workers and your clients. Present a business professional look by dressing appropriately for your workplace to give off an air of maturity.


For men, this may mean a full, tailored suit with a clean pressed dress shirt, tie, and leather shoes. If you work in a less formal environment, you should still show up to work in a clean shirt, clean pants, and comfortable, clean shoes.
For women, this may mean a clean, pressed blouse with a pencil skirt or dress pants, and low leather heels. If you work in a less formal environment, you should still present yourself professionally, with clean clothing and clean, comfortable shoes.

, While you may want to rock booty shorts, tube tops, or tight flashy pants for club nights out, this may come across as immature if you are no longer of a younger age. Dressing your age for a night out will demonstrate that you can present yourself in a mature manner and likely draw in individuals who are also mature and age appropriate. Even if you are younger in age, you may want to show less skin and adopt a mature look to appear put together but also sexy.


Men should wear clean, pressed pants or jeans, and a clean collared shirt. Put on cologne and nice jewelry like a watch or a chain to add a touch of class to your look.
Women should wear a form fitting dress or clean, pressed top and dress pants with heels or comfortable dressy shoes. Apply some perfume and make up as well as tasteful jewelry to demonstrate your mature, put together look.

, Let your co-workers and clients know you value their time by showing up five to ten minutes early for all meetings and important events at work. This will demonstrate your maturity as an adult in the workplace, as you are willing to put other people’s time above your own. Being late for a meeting or barging in during a client call is the definition of being unprofessional and immature.

You should also try to show up early for all classes and school related meetings, as this will demonstrate to your peers that you can be responsible for yourself and for arriving early or on time. Try to be early or on time for even seemingly casual or unimportant meetings with peers, as your peers will take it as a sign of your maturity and tact.

, Show up to work or to class ready to go, with all the necessary supplies and notes. For class, this may mean having a notebook, pen, textbook, and highlighter ready. For work, this may mean being prepared with pen, paper, client related notes or information, and your work phone.

Coming to class and work prepared will show your teachers and superiors that you take your role very seriously and are willing to do the hard work necessary to succeed. This will also project an air of confidence and self-respect as you are able to be accountable to the expectations of your role as a student and an employee.

, Demonstrate maturity in your interactions with others by having good manners and a respectful nature. This could be as simple as holding open the door for others, helping someone with a heavy package or a heavy load, or acknowledging everyone with a “good morning” or “hello”. Be considerate of the feelings and needs of others, with an awareness of how to be helpful and useful to your friends, peers, and co-workers.

You should also always knock on doors before you enter a room, meeting space, or office, and say “excuse me” if you are interrupting a client call or a meeting. This will demonstrate that you can be respectful of other people’s needs and time.

, Let others around you know how much you appreciate their hard work and dedication, as this will show you can take a mature approach to the workplace and the classroom. If you see a co-worker doing a great job on an account, pull them aside and say, “Great job on that, I really appreciate your hard work.” If you notice a peer helping a student struggling with a math problem, let them know you think it was cool of them to offer some guidance and mentoring.

You can also take on the role of a mentor or guide to others as a way to demonstrate maturity to others. Look for any peers who are struggling with their work or co-workers who may need a hand on a project and offer any guidance or assistance. This will allow you to be a role model for others and show how mature you can be.

, One of the most challenging parts of being mature is being willing to accept criticism and feedback. An immature response to criticism would be anger, resentment, or denial. A more mature response would be to say thank you to the person who is offering criticism and consider what the person has to say. This will show that you have enough confidence and maturity to respect the opinions of others and to listen to their feedback., Show others you can be mature by being active when you have conversations or discussions. Active listening means viewing every conversation as a way to get to know someone better or learn something new. When you are actively listening, the speaker can tell you are engaged in what they are saying and able to respond with energy and sincerity.

You can practice active listening with a sympathetic friend. Have the friend talk to you about her day and maintain your focus fully on her. Listen to her without interruption, while nodding and making eye contact to show you are engaged. Once she is finished speaking, repeat what she said to you in your own words. You can begin with, “What I hear you saying is…” or “I think you mean…”
If she agrees that you have understood what she said, you can respond to her and offer advice or a comment. This will show that you can have mature conversations and practice active listening.

, A big part of being mature is sympathizing with the needs of others and showing concern for others. Be open about your support and concern for friends, family, partners, and even strangers. This will show that you can think beyond your needs and be aware of what others around you might need.


Ask friends how they are feeling or how they are doing and show them you support them by participating in things that are important to them. This could be showing up for a friend’s rec game or a friend’s play, or participating in a charity drive organized by family and friends.

, Being polite towards others will show that you can be mature and carry yourself with respect. Open doors for others, say “please”, “thank you”, and “you’re welcome”, and say “excuse me” as you pass someone.


Good manners also means helping someone if it is obvious they need a hand, such as an elderly person trying to cross the street, or stopping to talk to someone in need, like a homeless person on the street. Having good manners and showing them to others will be a good indicator that you are mature enough to consider others and care about the well-being of those around you.

, If you are struggling with maturity in your relationships with a boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner, you should think about how you can demonstrate commitment and accountability to your partner. This could be making sure you arrive on time for every date and that you make an effort to remember all important dates or milestones in your relationship. Acting responsibly in your relationship will show your partner that you take the relationship seriously and are trying to be a mature adult.


You should also make sure you follow through on any commitments made to your partner, such as following through on a planned trip or date or following through on a promise to give up a bad habit like drinking or smoking. This will demonstrate you are willing to be accountable to your promises and act maturely in your interactions with your partner.

, While it may seem like being a mature individual can be a pretty tall order, with a commitment to being supportive, responsible, and a good listener to everyone around you, you can also adjust your maturity level based on the situation you are in. If you are around your family, for example, you may demonstrate a different maturity level than if you are around your close friends.


Try to adjust your maturity level so it suits the situation and the company you are in at that time. This will allow you to show the necessary level of maturity and still have a good time or have fun around others.

Understand the risks.",How to Run From an Abusive Home As a Teenager1," If you are experiencing or witnessing any type of abuse in your home, let someone know. You do not have to suffer in silence. Let a neighbor, teacher, school counselor, or another adult family member know what is happening in your home. There are people who want to help you.Your abuser may have threatened you or told you not to tell; do not listen to them.
If the first person you tell does not believe you, find another adult and tell them.
The adult you tell may call the police or call Child Protective Services.;
, Running away from home is a big decision. You want to get out of an abusive situation, but you are not sure how you can make it on your own. Also, living on the streets can be very dangerous. Ask yourself some questions before you run away:Do you have somewhere to stay?
How will you continue to go to school and get an education?
Who will you depend on if you leave home?
What will you do about food, money, and transportation?
Have you reached out to anyone about your situation at home?
Is there anything you can do to make things better at home?
Have you considered other options to make your home a safer place?

, If you decide that you want to run away, you need to make a plan to ensure that you stay safe and have the things that you need. You may have to stay at home a little longer until you get your affairs in order.Make a list of the things you will need to survive. Your list may include:


Food
Shelter
Transportation
Clothing
Money

, Having money will allow you to have food, transportation, and pay for shelter if you need to. Begin to save as much money as you can. If you have a job, begin saving the money you make in a safe place. If you do not have a job, find a way to make some extra money.


Good ways to make quick money include doing odd jobs around your neighborhood, babysitting, taking care of other people's pets, running your own business (e.g. sell candy, give manicures, sell any extra items) and house-sitting for friends and neighbors. If you get lunch money everyday, try to eat light or skip lunch and save the money instead.
If you are 18, you can open a bank account on your own to keep your money. If you are still a minor, you will not be able to open an account without your parent or legal guardian., A safe place to stay is the number one thing you need. Find a supportive family member, friend, or youth shelter in your area. It is best to know where you are going before you leave the house. If you do not know of anywhere to stay, call some of the numbers below:In the United States call Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453 or the National Runaway Safeline at 1-800-786-2929.

, Pack a bag with all of your essentials. Only take the things that you need because you do not want to have carry something that is too heavy. Take items such as clothes, medications, food, some form of ID, phone, and your social security card.


If you take a mobile phone, be careful. Your parent will be able to track you through your phone. If you can afford to, get a cheap phone that your parents don't know about.
Keep a list of contacts with you at all times such as police, emergency personnel, or anyone else who can help you in an emergency.

, Staying in an abusive home is bad, but you may also face some serious problems after you run away from home if you are not prepared. It is important that you think about what your life will really be like after you run away and have a good plan in place so that you can stay safe. If you run away:You are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, poor health, low self-esteem, poor nutrition, and have suicidal thoughts. Try to stay in touch with supportive friends, adults, or family members who can keep your spirits up.
You will have more difficulty attending school and completing your education. You will need to have a proof of residence and your immunization records to stay in school.
You may struggle to support yourself financially and get a job. Save some money or get a job so you do not have to do illegal or unsafe things (e.g. sell drugs or use your body).
If you have a safe place to sleep, save money before you leave, and a way to stay in school, you should be able to avoid most of these.

Consider the potential legal consequences.,
Stop if you encounter a police officer.,
Get a new legal guardian.,
Emancipate yourself.",How to Run From an Abusive Home As a Teenager3," In most states, running away from home is not considered a crime. If you run away repeatedly, you may become under the supervision of juvenile court or family court. The legal system can provide services to your family or can punish (e.g. fines, drug testing, curfews, suspended driving privileges) you and your family.You also may have to go live with a family member or in a foster home.


It is illegal to run away in Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming if you are under the age of 18.

Say something if you feel suicidal.",How to Seek Therapy if You Are a Teen," Often, the hardest part about opening up to your parents is starting the conversation. Take some time and decide what you want to say. You might even want to write down your thoughts so that you can communicate them clearly. When you’re ready to talk, make sure you and parent or guardian have time to talk without rushing off to something else. Keep distractions minimal so that you all can focus on the discussion.


When you’re ready to talk, open with something like, “I need to tell you about what’s going on with me because I want to keep you clued in. I’m struggling, and I think a therapist could help me.”;
, Let your parents know what’s going on with you. If you feel depressed, say so. If you’re struggling with anxiety, be brave enough to admit it. Maybe you think you have ADHD or are struggling academically. If your parents are getting a divorce or you’re being bullied at school, this can impact you greatly and it’s hard to cope on your own. Being open with your parents can clue them in as to how you’re doing and open the lines of communication.For example, say, “School has been really hard because I’m being bullied. I wish it didn’t affect me so much, but it does, and I think I’m depressed.”

, Tell your parents what you need, both in general and from them. If you’re asking them to see a therapist, say so. If you’re asking for ideas, say that, too. For example, if you want to see a therapist and you need your parent’s insurance to cover it, make a request. Be reasonable and realize that your request is valid and important to you.For example, you can say, “I want to talk to a therapist, and I know that means I need to ask you to use insurance to pay for it.”

, Ask your parents to support you both in the struggles you’re going through and in seeing a therapist. Some parents might view seeing a therapist as giving up or not being strong enough on your own. If your parents respond this way, don’t give up hope. Share why you want help and recognize that asking for help is a sign of strength, not defeat.


If your parents are skeptical or uneasy, say, “I know this is strange, but please give it a chance. I want help and I want your support.”

, If you’re ready to find a therapist, start the search for someone near you. The internet provides several ways to find a therapist near you who is qualified and can help you. You can also ask your friends or family for a recommendation. For example, a friend may see a therapist and say nice things about them.Look for someone who specializes in working with teens.


Decide whether a therapist’s gender matters to you. You might want to see a man or a woman, depending on your preferences and the issues you want to discuss.
Look for someone who is covered by your family's insurance plan or accepts patients on a ""sliding scale."" This means that they offer their sessions based on what you can afford.

, When you’ve found one therapist (or maybe a few therapists) you’re interested in, call them. Ask to speak to them directly and take note of how you feel talking to them. Once the conversation is over, notice if you felt comfortable talking to them and want to build a therapeutic relationship with them.Ask any questions you might have. For example, if you’re depressed, ask them if they work with teen depression.

, For your first appointment, you'll want to assess the professional to see whether you seem to be a good fit. Ask any questions you have about the therapeutic process. Find out whether this person feels right to you and whether you want to go back and see them again. Most first appointments serve as an intake, and the therapist will gather information about you and create a plan with you to reach your therapeutic goals.If you do feel comfortable and think they can help, schedule a second appointment.

, Ideally, it's good to see a mental health professional weekly, or more frequently if you have very serious problems. You may only need a few sessions to learn some useful coping strategies, or if you find that therapy is having a positive impact in your life you may want to continue long-term.


If you’re having money problems, consider seeing an intern. They often have reduced rates, yet still offer quality services.

, You might not feel comfortable talking to your parents or guardians or you might want to talk to someone else first. You might confide in a teacher, coach, spiritual mentor, or relative. Find someone you trust and let them know what’s going on. You might even want the support of another adult to back you up if you do talk to your parents.Opening up to someone is a good first step. They can help you talk to your parents, find a therapist, or help you take steps to move forward.

, Most middle and high schools have school counselors who are available to talk to. They can help you talk through your problems and help you navigate what to do next. The nice thing about going to see a school counselor is that you can talk to them during school hours. You might need to make an appointment or you may be able to walk in.Going to a school counselor is a great place to start. If you need more help, they can refer you to a therapist or someone else to talk to outside of school.

, If you are enrolled in a university or college, many campuses offer free or low-cost therapy sessions that are confidential. These are regular therapy sessions with trained therapists. They can help you with multiple mental health and emotional health issues such as breakups, family problems, academic problems, and mental health diagnoses.One benefit of going to a university counseling center is your privacy, because you don’t have to share your counseling experience with your friends or family.

, Often, people self-harm as a way to cope with emotional pain, and it can be anything that purposefully hurts your body. This might be cutting (using a razor blade against your skin), pinching yourself, burning yourself (with cigarettes, lighters, or flames), pulling out your hair, breaking your bones or bruising yourself. Therapy can be helpful in working through these difficult emotions and experiences.Say, “I’m having a hard time getting through, and I’ve been hurting myself. I need help because I can’t do this on my own without hurting myself.”

, If you feel suicidal, tell someone. Whether you tell a guidance counselor, parent, friend, or teacher, it’s important that you let someone know what you’re thinking and feeling. You don’t have to suffer alone.If you’re seriously considering ending your life call call emergency services. You can also call a suicide hotline. In the USA, call (800-273-8255). In the UK, call +44 (0) 8457 90 90 90, and in Australia call 08 93 88 2500.

Before reaching out to another person, it may be helpful to think about why you need and want to change your behavior.People have different motivations for quitting. You may be motivated by a desire to manage your pain better. You may be fearful of the behavior getting worse, or getting sent to the hospital. You may also worry about how your cutting affects friends and loved ones.
Whatever your reasons, identify why you want to quit. Starting a journal to write down how you are feeling when you want to cut can help understand how to stop or find other coping methods. It can even help to write down a list of reasons that you do not want to cut anymore. You can refer back to this list in moments when you feel tempted.;
, It is very hard to stop cutting on your own. It can be helpful to open up to someone when you begin the quitting process. This person can provide you with support along the way.Choose someone you know you can trust. You do not want to pick a friend who's notorious for gossip or someone who is judgmental. It may be a good idea to tell a parent, as your mom or dad can help you find professional help.
It can be scary to admit to someone you have been cutting. You may be afraid of an adverse reaction. Keep in mind, however, you will probably feel relieved once you tell someone. It's very hard to keep things bottled up, and you will feel better once you've reached out and asked for support.
Consider speaking with your pediatrician or family doctor as a first step. They can be a very helpful resource. It may be easier to tell your parents, too, if you have already talked about it with your doctor and you, your parents, and your doctor can discuss it together.

, Your comfort is very important. Telling someone you have been cutting is not easy, and it's important you open up in a way that makes you feel safe.You do not have to have a face-to-face conversation right away. If the idea of telling someone directly is scary, try writing a letter or email. Allow the person to process, and then talk face-to-face later on.
You don't have to share everything. If you're not ready to open up about some information, give yourself time. Make it clear to the person you may not answer all the questions they have. You do not have to show your injuries or explain any details you're not ready to share.
Focus on your feelings when you talk to the other person. Do not talk primarily about the self-harm behavior. Talk about the feelings, situations, or emotions that led to the behavior. For example, ""I've been so stressed about school. I think I'm having trouble managing my emotions about my senior year.""

, It can be shocking to hear a loved one is cutting. The person you open up to may need time to process the information. Have some patience.You may dislike someone's initial reaction. Remember, reactions are usually temporary. Just because someone responds with shock, fear, or anger does not mean they will feel this way forever. These reactions usually come out of concern for you.
It can help to print out some pamphlets about cutting that you find online. Many people do not understand self-harm. Having some reading material can help them process.
If you have already reached out for help from a health professional, such as your family doctor or a counselor at school, it may be helpful for you and your parents to meet with them so they can support you as you tell your parents.

, It's great to have someone to support you as you quit. However, a friend, family member, or loved one may not be able to help you during a crisis. In some situations, psychiatric or medical help is necessary.If you ever feel suicidal, call 9-1-1. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at (800) 273-8255.
If you find yourself in crisis without anyone to talk to, call (800) 366-8288. This is the number for the S.A.F.E Alternatives program, which offers support for those who engage in self-harm.

, Have a range of distractions in the back of your mind at all times. In the moment when you feel the urge to self-harm, you should have an alternative behavior ready. Sometimes, the best way to avoid engaging in self-harm is to find a distraction from your feelings.Think about things you enjoy doing. You can go for a walk or run, play with a pet, call a friend to talk about something completely different, or watch television. Make sure to change the channel if you see something distressing.
It may help to have a list of distractions written down somewhere. If you feel the urge to cut, refer to your list.

, Cutting often comes in response to stress and anxiety. If you're feeling anxious, find something soothing to calm you down.A warm bath or a shower can be soothing to some people. Just make sure there are no razors in the shower.
Try a deep breathing exercise. You can find many different guided routines online. You can also try doing something like yoga. Ask your parents about enrolling in a yoga course. When you're feeling stressed, you'll know a few moves to calm you down.
Try listening to soothing music. This can potentially calm your mood.

, Many people cut because they are feeling pain. You do not need to express your pain physically. There are healthier ways to address your emotions.Drawing or doodling can help you figure out your emotions. Many people find red pen or paint very expressive.
Keep a journal and write out your anger and frustration. You can also try writing fiction or poetry about how you're feeling.

, Cutting can sometimes soothe physical tension associated with stress; however, there are much healthier means to get rid of tension than cutting. Get some exercise instead of cutting when you feel tense.Go for a walk or a run.
Take a bike ride.
Dance in your bedroom.
Try any other form of exercise you enjoy, like playing a sport.

, Talk to your parents about therapy if you've been cutting. Cutting can be a sign of an underlying mental illness, so it's important to seek professional help. Your parents should be able to find a therapist through their insurance provider or by asking your regular doctor for a referral.If your family can't afford therapy, try talking to your school guidance counselor or checking to see if there are any free or discount mental health clinics in your area.

, Just sitting down and talking to someone who won't judge you can be a huge relief. Psychodynamic therapy can get to the bottom of the real reason you're cutting. It may help bring up underlying things you never even knew were bothering you.You may be asked to focus on past experiences. A bad experience at some point in your life may be affecting your ability to regulate your emotions in a healthy fashion.
In this type of therapy, you will converse with a therapist. They will guide the discussion to try to find the root cause of your behavior. You may also work on figuring any potential triggers that can cause you to cut.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be very effective in treating self-harm. With CBT, you are shown ways to become aware of negative patterns and alter your behavior.Usually, you have a session once a week with a therapist. Sessions are generally 30 to 60 minutes.
Your therapist will help you break down your thoughts, physical feelings, and actions. You will work to figure out what kind of thoughts and behaviors are not helpful, and find more positive ways to cope.
Your therapist will recommend you do certain exercises at home to help you better regulate your emotions. At the next session, you and your therapist will talk about the effectiveness of these activities.

, There are no specific medications prescribed for cutting; however, underlying mental health issues like depression and anxiety can contribute to cutting. These are often treated with medication. If you believe medication would help, ask your therapist about possible medications.Antidepressants and other medications may be effective in stopping your cutting.
A psychiatrist will determine if medication is right for you. This will be based on your medical history, mental health diagnosis, and other factors.

Ask your doctor about platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy.",How to Treat Tendonitis," Inflamed tendons can be caused by a sudden injury, but they're usually triggered by small, repetitive movements over the course of many days, weeks or months.Repetitive motions put stress on the tendons, which creates micro-tears and localized inflammation. Identify what action is creating the problem and either take a break from it (at least a few days) or modify the movement somehow. If the tendonitis is work related, then talk to your employer about temporarily switching to a different activity. If your problem is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with improper form — consult with a personal trainer.


Playing too much tennis and golf are common causes of elbow joint tendinitis, thus the terms ""tennis elbow"" and ""golfer's elbow.""
Acute tendonitis will usually heal itself if you give your body a chance to rest, but if you don't, it can become a chronic (ongoing) problem that's much more difficult to treat.;
, The pain from tendonitis is primarily due to inflammation, which is an attempt by the body to heal and protect the injured tissue. However, the body's inflammatory response is usually too much and actually contributes to the problem, so controlling it is key to reducing the symptoms. As such, apply an icepack, frozen gel pack or bag or even a bag of frozen veggies to your inflamed tendon in order to reduce inflammation and dull the pain.Apply cold therapy every few hours until the pain and inflammation subside.


If the inflammation is in smaller, more exposed tendons/muscles (such as the wrist or elbow), then apply the ice for about 10 minutes. If it's a larger or deeper tendon/muscle (such as the shoulder or hip), then leave the ice on for closer to 20 minutes.
While you're icing the inflamed tendon, elevate the area and compress it by tying a Tensor or Ace bandage around the area — both techniques more efficiently combat inflammation.
Don't forget to wrap ice up in a thin cloth before your apply it, as it will prevent negative reactions such as ice burn or frostbite.

, Another method of combating the inflammation of tendonitis is by the use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) help control the body's inflammation reaction, which reduces swelling and pain. NSAIDs tend to be hard on the stomach (and the kidneys and liver to a lesser extent), so it's best not take them for much longer than two weeks for any particular injury.


As an alternative to pills, consider applying an anti-inflammatory/pain-relieving cream or gel to your inflamed tendon, especially if it's close to the skin's surface where it can be absorbed and have a greater impact.
Avoid the use of painkillers (acetaminophen) or muscle relaxers (cyclobenzaprine) for your symptoms, because they don't address inflammation.

, Mild-to-moderate tendonitis and muscle strains often respond well to stretching because it relieves muscle tension, promotes circulation and increases flexibility and range of motion.Stretching is applicable for acute tendonitis (as long as the pain/inflammation is not severe), chronic tendonitis and as a preventative measure. While stretching, use slow, steady movements and hold the positions for 20 – 30 seconds; repeat three to five times daily, especially before and after intense activity.


For chronic tendonitis or as an injury prevention strategy, apply moist heat to the affected area before stretching it because the muscles and tendons will be warmed up and more flexible.
Keep in mind that the pain of tendonitis is usually worse at night and after movement or activity.

, If the tendonitis involves your knee, elbow or wrist, then consider wearing a flexible neoprene sleeve or more supportive nylon/Velcro brace in order to help protect the area and limit movement.Wearing a support or brace also helps to remind you to take it easy and not overdo it while at work or in the gym.


However, complete immobility of an inflamed area is not recommended either because tendons, muscles and related joints need some movement to get consistent blood circulation in order to heal properly.
In addition to wearing a support, examine the ergonomics of your work area and make sure it suits your size and body type. If need be, adjust your chair, keyboard and desktop to alleviate excessive stress on your joints and tendons.

, If your tendonitis isn't going away and hasn't responded very well to rest and basic home care, then see your doctor for a physical examination. Your doctor will assess the severity of your tendonitis, sometimes using diagnostic equipment such as ultrasound or MRI, and give you recommendations. If the tendon has torn away from the bone (ruptured), then a referral to an orthopedic surgeon for surgical repair will be necessary.For less serious situations, rehabilitation and/or steroid injections are often more appropriate.


Most surgeries for severe tendonitis is performed arthroscopically, by inserting a small camera and miniature instruments through small incisions close to joints.For chronic tendonitis, focused aspiration of scar tissue (FAST) is a minimally invasive surgery that removes scar tissue from the tendon without irritating the healthy tissue., If your tendonitis is a chronic condition, but not particularly serious, then your doctor will likely refer you for rehabilitation, such as physiotherapy. A physical therapist will show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your affected tendon and surrounding musculature. For example, eccentric strengthening — which involves contraction of a muscle/tendon while it's lengthening — is effective in treating chronic tendonitis.. Physical therapy is usually required two to three per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic tendonitis.


Physical therapists can also treat inflamed tendons with therapeutic ultrasound or micro-current, both proven to help relieve inflammation and stimulate healing.
Some physical therapists (and other medical professionals) use low-energy light waves (infrared) to decrease inflammation and pain in mild-to-moderate musculoskeletal injuries., If your doctor thinks it's warranted, he may recommend a steroid injection into or near your inflamed tendon. Steroids such as cortisone are very effective at reducing inflammation in a short period of time, which can eliminate pain and restore mobility (at least short-term), but there are risks to be aware of.In rare cases, corticosteroid injections can further weaken the injured tendon and cause it to tear. As such, corticosteroid injections are not recommended repeatedly for tendinitis lasting over three months because it increases the risk of tendon ruptures.Steroid injections provide short-term pain relief, but may not have long-term success.In addition to tendon weakening, other side effects associated with steroid injections include infection, local muscle atrophy, nerve damage and reduced immune function.
If steroid injections fail to resolve the tendonitis, particularly if it's in conjunction with physical therapy, then some form of surgery should be considered.

, PRP treatment is relatively new and still being studied, but it involves taking a sample of your blood and spinning it to separate out the platelets and various healing factors from the red blood cells.The plasma mixture is then injected into chronically inflamed tendon(s), which is reported to reduce inflammation and boost tissue healing.


If effective, PRP would be a much better alternative to corticosteroid injections due to the lack of side effects.
As with any invasive procedure, there always exists risks of infection, excessive bleeding and/or the build-up of scar tissue.

Manipulate the Bladder Meridian points.,
Stimulate the local and adjacent points at the site of injury.,
Use acupressure points to release endorphins.",How to Use Acupressure Points for Foot Pain1," These charts show the exact location of the points described below and unless you are very familiar with acupuncture points, you’ll need the charts to locate the correct pressure points in your body. Check the following website for free acupuncture charts:



Chiro.orgQi-journal.com;
, Acupressure points are manipulated in two different ways: by either pressing (reinforcing) or reducing them.Pressing technique: Use your fingers or something blunt (such as a pencil eraser at the end of a pencil) to press the particular point between 30 seconds to two minutes. Shorter pressures can be used and even a few seconds can provide relief.
Reducing technique: Place your finger over a point and turn a finger in counter-clockwise direction for one to two minutes.
Use enough pressure to feel the pressure but not too much (you should not feel pain).
For each acupuncture point mentioned below, use one or both of the techniques mentioned above from 30 seconds to two minutes per point (unless directed otherwise).

, These are located on the bottom of the foot. Consult the acupuncture charts to find these points in your body and manipulate one or several of the following points: Fuliu KI-7 (on the front, inner side of the achilles tendon) and Jiaoxin KI-8 (the front, inner side of the rounded border of the shinbone, above the ankle) points. Apply pressure to these two points at the same time.
Dazhong KI-4 (behind and under the medial malleolus, or the bony knob on the inner side of your ankle) and Shuiquan KI-5 (on the inner side of the heel, in a depression below but in front of KI-4) points.
Yongquan KI-1 (on the sole of the foot) together with the Liver Meridian point Taichong LV-3 (on back of the foot). Applying acupressure to these two points helps treat tendons and ligaments.

, These acupuncture points are indicated for diseases in the lower limbs as well as in the head, neck, eyes, back, groin.


Manipulate the following two points: Weizhong BL-54 (at the very top of your hamstring, closer to the inner part of the back of your leg) and Chengshan BL-57 (below the calf muscle) points., The Shimian M-LE 5, located at the center of the heel, is a local point that acts as the target zone of the plantar fascia and its attachment to the heel bone.Apply acupressure for 30 seconds to 2 minutes to the Shimian M-LE 5.

, Activating pressure points relieves pain and relaxes muscular tension releasing endorphins. These endorphins are similar to morphine in the way of numbing the pain. By applying pressure to the Liver Meridian LV-3 and Gall Bladder Meridian GB- 41 points, you can enable your body to produce its own natural painkillers.In Chinese medicine, the liver is an energy organ and when someone has liver imbalances they are more susceptible to tendon inflammation and continuous stress injury.Taichong LV-3 is located on the top of the foot between the first and second metatarsal bones.Zulinqi GB-41 is also on the top of the foot between the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones.
Relieve pain by pressing your fingers firmly and steadily on the two points for two minutes. Breathe deeply while you do this.

Begin by working with your doctor to order the limb necessary to aid in your recovery and return to normal life.,
Meet with your prosthetist for care and initial instructions.,
Learn about your temporary prosthetic limb.,
Obtain your permanent prosthetic limb when your residual limb has stabilized.,
Put on your prosthetic socks.,
Put your stump into the prosthetic limb and push down on it until your pin clicks and locks.

,
Know the warning signs of a poor fitting limb.",How to Wear a Prosthesis," Some people choose not to have a prosthetic limb, but for those who do, tasks and life can become easier as the transition occurs.


The amount of activity that you do and the goals that you set will help your doctor determine what kind of prosthesis is right for you.;
,


He will walk you through the use of your prosthetic limb so you can see how to put the limb on and how it is secured.
Your prosthetist will start you out with a temporary prosthetic limb until your permanent one arrives.

,


Your temporary prosthesis will have a simpler design than a permanent prosthetic limb. It will have a socket that you put your residual limb into. This will lead into a pipe that supports the limb, followed by an extremity piece that is designed to look like a real hand, foot or other limb.
Continue to wear a shrinker sock on a daily basis.
As your residual limb resizes, wear prosthetic socks to offer additional ply for a better fit.

, This can take anywhere from around 6 to 12 months.


If your prosthetic has a silicon liner, roll the liner on to your residual limb so that the pin is centered over your stump.

, Add additional socks if you need more ply to hold your limb in place.

,, Speak to your prosthetist if you experience any of these issues to schedule an adjustment of the limb.


If your prosthetic limb feels heavy to you or feels hard to move, this could signify that it is attached too loosely.
Open sores or blisters that appear on your residual limb can signify that either the limb is on too tightly or too loosely. In the event that this happens, discontinue use of the prosthesis until you can get in to see your prosthetist. Also see a doctor to treat the wounds, if necessary.
Contact your prosthetist if when you walk, your residual limb goes up and down in the socket. You should have a snug fit and not one that is too loose.

Whenever you feel like you have shin splints, you first need to rest and let the muscles cool down before you begin to stretch. You don't want to overdo it and end up hurting yourself more.If you think your shin splints might be due to your footwear, you should change your shoes before beginning the stretches. You don't want to hurt your shins more than they already are.;
, Starting the day you get shin splints, you need to ice your shins. The coolness of the ice will help decrease the inflammation of the muscles in your shins and help alleviate the pain. You should ice them four to six times a day for 15 minutes at a time.


Make sure you wrap any ice pack with a cloth or towel. Applying ice directly to your skin can cause frostbite., You need to rest your shins for a few days after your shin splints. You should avoid high impact exercises such as running or jogging. Try exercises such as swimming, spinning, or biking instead. They put much less strain on your shins and will allow them time to heal.


Your stretches can be done at any point after you get shin splints. They are considered low impact exercises., One of the major causes of shin splints is improper shoes. You should replace your shoes every three to six months or every 500 miles. You also need to make sure you have shoes that are right for the shape of your feet and the exercises you perform in them.


For example, you should get shoes specifically made for running if you are a runner. They provide different kinds of support to help you with running., Stand about a foot from the wall with your feet flat on the floor. Slowly lean back, placing your back and butt against the wall. From this position, lift your toes off the ground toward the ceiling. Hold this for 5 seconds. Repeat 10–15 times.


You can increase your holding time the more you do it. This will help increase the endurance and strength of your muscles.
This stretch helps loosen and strengthen the front portion of your lower leg.
If you are not using a wall, make sure the surface you lean against is sturdy., To stretch the bulging top area of your calf, stand facing the wall with one foot shoulder width in front of the other. Keep your back leg straight and bend your front knee. Push against the wall until you feel the stretch through the calf in your back leg. Hold for 30 seconds. Change legs, repeating the same exercise on the other side. Do three sets in total.


This will help loosen your calf muscle and relieve the pain in your shin., To stretch the smaller, lower muscle in your calf, stand with one foot in front of the other. Place your hands on the wall for balance. Bend both knees slightly and lean back into the stretch. Hold for 30 seconds. Slowly come back up and change legs, performing the stretch again. Do three sets total.


This will relax the top muscle and focus the stretch on the lower muscle.
This stretch helps decrease the pain in your shins., Kneel down on the floor. Gently sit back, sitting on your heels. Gently push down to stretch the muscles in the front of your legs. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Lean up, releasing the stretch in your muscles. Repeat three times.


You can do this one leg at a time if you are uncomfortable doing it with both at the same time.
Make sure you only stretch as far as you can. You don't want to overextend your muscles and hurt yourself., Stand with your feet shoulder width apart near a step or raised surface. Lift your foot and place the ball of your foot on the step or raised surface. Gently bend your knee and lean forward, pressing your heel down toward the floor. Hold for 10–15 seconds. Do 10–15 reps.


Repeat this exercise on the other side. Do 10–15 additional reps on this side as well., Kneel on one knee and place the other leg in front of your with your foot flat on the floor. Gently lean forward, bending the knee in front of you and pushing your knee gently toward the floor. Hold this stretch for 20-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.


Make sure you don't push down too hard on your knee. You want to stretch the shin and Achilles tendon, not injure yourself further., To help loosen up the muscles in your shins, you can draw the alphabet with your toes. In a sitting position, point the toes of one of your feet toward the ground. Trace the whole alphabet with your toe, drawing out each letter. Repeat this will your other foot.


Do 4 reps. When you are first recovering, you can do this exercise up to three times a day to help loosen your muscles and promote shin health., Stand straight with your feet shoulder width apart. Step forward with one foot, stepping one foot a normal walking step ahead of the other. Instead of lowering your foot all the way down to the ground, touch just your heel to the ground with your toes flexed toward the ceiling. Gently lower your toes toward the ground, but don't touch the sole of your foot to the ground. Raise your toes back up and return to your beginning stance.


Do 10–15 reps on this side. Next, switch legs and repeat on the other side. Do 10–15 reps on that side as well., Grab a towel or exercise band. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. Wrap the exercise band or towel around the arch of the foot on the leg that is straight out. Using the towel or band, pull your foot toward you. Hold for 10–15 seconds. Repeat two to three times on each foot.


This can also be used to alleviate shin splints., Sit on the floor near a table or stationary object. Using a resistance band, wrap the band around the stable surface, such as a table leg. Loop the other side of the resistance band around the top of one of your feet. Once it is looped, pull your foot toward your knee, pulling against the resistance band. Hold for 10–15 seconds. Do 10–15 reps on one leg. Change feet and repeat the reps. Do three sets in all.


This exercise strengthens your lower leg and helps reduce the recurrence of shin splints.
You can increase your strength by using heavier resistance bands or increasing to 20-30 reps., Stand with your heel together and toes pointed out. Slowly raise up onto your toes. After a few seconds, slowly lower yourself back down. Repeat 10–15 times. This exercise strengthens your calf muscles and helps promote balance.


You can perform another kind of calf raise to strengthen a different set of calf muscles. Start with your big toes touching and your heels far apart. Slowly raise up onto your toes as high as you can go. After a few seconds, lower yourself back down. Repeat 10–15 times., Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Start walking across the floor, using just your heels to stand on. Continue this for 30 seconds. Switch to regular walking for 30 seconds. Then, repeat the rotation three more times.


This will help strengthen the calf and shin muscles in your legs."

Overexertion can make the pain worse, and possibly cause other complications. For a few days, avoid putting too much weight on the knee that is in pain. You may also want to refrain from certain activities that increase knee pain.

Change your routine if necessary. If you normally take public transportation to work, for example, drive for a few days. This can cut down on walking time.
Switch to low impact exercises, like swimming or biking, instead of activities like running and jogging.;
, The R.I.C.E method is a classic means to treat knee and joint pain. R.I.C.E stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Application of the R.I.C.E method can help reduce patellofemoral pain.Rest your knee for a few days after you begin to notice the pain. Avoid excessive walking or exercise while the pain persists.
Ice your knee. You can use ice placed in a paper bag, or an ice pack you can buy at the store. Make sure not to apply an ice pack directly to your knee, however. Wrap the pack in a towel first. Ice your knee for 20 minute periods.
Compression means lightly wrapping your knee in an elastic band. This can help reduce swelling and inflammation.
Elevation means elevating the knee above your heart. Throughout the day, try to raise your knee above your heart as often as you can.

, Over-the-counter medication can help manage pain. Painkillers such as ibuprofen, which also have anti-inflammatory properties, can be particularly helpful when treating patellofemoral pain.

Make sure to read the directions for safe use when using over-the-counter medication. Do not take more than the recommended dose.
If you're on any existing prescription medication, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist before taking over-the-counter medication. You want to make sure any over-the-counter painkillers will not have an adverse reaction with your existing medication.

, While knee braces and knee taping are often recommended to lessen swelling and inflammation, take caution when taping your knee or using an over-the-counter brace.Over-the-counter knee braces have not been proven to be effective at treating patellofemoral pain, although some people find they do help reduce pain. You may want to talk to a doctor before using a knee brace.
Taping a knee can help reduce friction, cutting back on patellofemoral pain, but studies on the effectiveness in the longterm have come back with mixed results. However, taping does provide short term pain relief. If your patellofemoral pain is bothersome throughout the day, taping your knee may help.

, Usually, patellofemoral pain will pass over on its own with rest. However, if you pain persists despite at home treatment, make an appointment with your physician to have your knee evaluated.

Your doctor will perform a basic physical to get a sense of what may be causing your knee pain. Blood work and x-rays may be ordered depending on the results of the physical.
An MRI scan, which is a scan that shows the details of a knee joint, may also be used to diagnose pain. In some cases, a doctor may use arthroscopy. This is when a tiny camera is inserted into the knee to get a better look at the cartilage.

, Physical therapy is usually recommended for persistent patellofemoral pain. Depending on which knee muscles are causing the pain, you will engage in a variety of exercises to help alleviate knee pain. Your doctor should refer you to a physical therapist if he or she believes physical therapy is needed to resolve knee pain.A physical therapist will help you engage in exercises during your sessions. A physical therapist will usually recommend at home treatment. You will be instructed to engage in about 20 minutes of day of specific stretches and exercises. You may not need to meet with your physical therapist in person very often, during the course of treatment.
In order for treatment to be effective, make sure you follow the physical therapist's advice. Overnight success is rare, and it can take weeks or months for treatment to help reduce pain. Make sure you follow a treatment plan strictly and contact the physical therapist regularly with any questions or concerns.

, Medical shoe inserts are frequently used to treat patellofemoral pain, as inadequate arch support can cause or worsen pain. Orthotics, or shoe inserts, are inserts modeled to your feet that you place in shoes before going out. While custom made orthotics provide the best results, you can buy orthotics, or superfeet from a drug store for a cheaper price. Talk to your doctor about where and when you should wear shoe inserts, and whether this is a good option for your patellofemoral pain., If your pain does not respond to non-surgical treatment, surgery may be necessary to address the underlying causes of patellofemoral pain. Keep in mind surgery is very rare, and it is unlikely your pain will require surgery. In the event you need surgery, your doctor will decide on the type of surgery that best alleviates your patellofemoral pain.Your doctor may remove cartilage to provide pain relief. They may also want to do a surgery to correct misalignment of the knees and remove excess tissue. The type of surgery you require depends on what is causing your pain.
Recovery time for surgery varies, and depends on factors like your age and overall health. Talk to your doctor about recovery and make sure you follow his or her instructions for aftercare.

, Strong hips and quadriceps can help your knees stay healthy. If you suffer from patellofemoral pain on a regular basis, engage in a strength training program to keep your body strong.You can use resistance tubing, your own body weight, free weights, or weight machines to strength train. You may want to ask your doctor or physical therapist what brand of weight training would best address your pain.You want to start slow with weight training. Do a reasonable number of repetitions of any given movement, such as 12 to 15 repetitions. Do not increase the number of repetitions until you can comfortably do 12 to 15. Aim for 20 to 30 minutes of weight training twice a week, and avoid training two days in a row.

, If you are overweight or obese, you're more prone to patellofemoral pain. Talk to your doctor about starting a weight loss program that will help you shed excess pounds.You can lose weight through a combination of calorie restriction and regular exercise. Make sure you do not restrict your calories to an unreasonable level. Ask your doctor to give a range of calories you can safely eat each day.
Work out regularly. Choose a form of exercise you enjoy, as this will make it more likely that you'll stick to a workout regimen. If you hate running, for example, you're unlikely to go for a job three times a week. If you enjoy riding your bike, however, you're likely to ride your bike regularly.

, Warming up before exercise can reduce your risk for patellofemoral pain. A warm up is light exercise you engage in before jumping into a strenuous workout routine. You may sweat slightly during a warm-up, but you should not feel fatigued. There are several different ways to warm up before exercise.

Take a 5 to 10 minute brisk walk.
Do a small, light jog for 5 to 10 minutes before a strenuous run.
If you swim, do light and non-demanding swimming for about 5 to 10 minutes before you start pushing yourself.

, Stretching is vital to preventing patellofemoral pain. Before and after exercise, invest in some light stretching to prevent joint pain. There are several ways you can stretch to cut back on pain and fatigue.As with any other type of exercise, walk gently for a few minutes before stretching before you begin. Target major muscle groups when stretching, such as your back, calves, and thighs.
Hold each stretch for about 30 seconds. If you stretch to the point you're feeling pain, you're stretching too much and this can cause joint pain. Make sure to relax when stretching. You should not hold your breath during stretches.

, Choose shoes that fit you well. If you strain to put shoes on, consider investing in a larger size. Shoes should have solid arch support. You should not overdo wearing heels or flats, especially for long walks.

If you have flat feet, talk to your doctor about getting shoe inserts.

Manipulate the “Illuminated Sea“ point.,
Engage the “Qiuxu” point.,
Manipulate the “High Mountains” point.,
Try working the “Calm Sleep” point.",How to Use Acupressure Points for Foot Pain2," This pressure point (also known KI-6) can be found on the inner side of the ankle, one thumb width below the anklebone. This will help relieve swollen and stiff ankles. Place your thumbs one centimeter away from the ankle.
Apply pressure with both thumbs on both pressure points simultaneously.

, This acupressure point (also known as GB-40) is located in the large hollow directly in front of the outer anklebone. Manipulating this point relieves ankle problems including sprains, swelling and sciatic pain.


Press this point with a finger or pencil for one to two minutes, alternating every 60 seconds between light and firm pressure.Eventually you can work up to five to 10 minutes of pressure.
You can use fingers, knuckles, side of the hand, an eraser on a pencil, etc. to apply pressure. If using your hands, you should change hands every minute or so to avoid being fatigued.

, This point (also known as BL-60) is located in the hollow between the outer anklebone and the Achilles tendon. This can help with swollen feet, ankle pain, thigh pain, arthritis in the foot joints, lower back pain, and increase blood flow.Place your thumb on the point between the outer ankle bone and the Achilles tendon.
Press this point for five minutes by releasing the pressure after every thirty seconds for a few seconds.
Repeat two or three times at night every day for faster relief.
This point is contraindicated during pregnancy., This point (also known as BL-62) is the first indentation directly below the outer anklebone.

You can ask your doctor to recommend a proper exercise regimen. Exercise will improve your blood flow and nourish damaged nerves. Walking reduces your overall blood sugar levels and makes diabetes easier to control. If you successfully control your diabetes, your neuropathy will lessen.If you struggle with setting aside time to exercise, remember that you can take small steps to be active. For example, you can clean up the house, play with the dog, or hand wash your car. All of these will get your blood flowing.;
, Fill a small container or tub with warm water and add 1/4 cup of Epsom salt for each cup of water. Make sure the water isn't over 100 degrees. Set your feet in the container or tub so that the water covers them. The warmth of the water can relax you and distract from the pain in your feet. And, Epsom salts contain magnesium which can relax your muscles.If you have an infection or swelling, ask your doctor before soaking in Epsom salts., Alcohol can be toxic to your nerves, especially if they are already damaged. You should limit yourself to four drinks spaced over the course of a week. Some forms of neuropathy are actually caused by alcoholism, so you should eliminate alcohol if you have any neuropathy.Stopping drinking can relieve your symptoms and prevent more damage.If alcoholism runs in your family, you may not want to drink at all. Consider giving alcohol up entirely to stay safe and healthy.

, This natural oil found in a wildflower is available in pill form. Ask your doctor to recommend a specific dose of the supplement evening primrose oil. Studies have shown that the fatty acids it contains can improve symptoms of neuropathy.These fatty acids improve your nerve function.


Other sources of the beneficial fatty acid (GLA) include borage oil and black currant oil.

, Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine in which needles are placed on specific pressure points. Stimulating these pressure points, or acupoints, causes the body to release endorphins, which soothe pain. The acupuncturist will insert four to ten needles into acupoints, and leave them there for about half an hour. You will need six to twelve sessions over a period of three months.Check the reputation of your acupuncturist before your appointment. Make sure that the facility and needles are sterile to avoid blood-borne diseases.

, In addition to acupuncture, you can try meditation and low-intensity transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for relief of neuropathy symptoms.The TENS procedure uses a small battery pack to charge probes that are placed around areas where you're experiencing pain. The probes and battery create a circuit through which an electrical current passes to stimulate the area. Studies have shown that TENS is effective in treating certain kinds of neuropathic pain, although more research is needed.Of meditation methods, you can try walking meditation, sitting meditation, Qigong, or Tai Chi. Studies showed pain reduction with regular meditation., A variety of medications are available to treat neuropathy. Your doctor will focus on managing the medical disorder that's causing your neuropathy which will reduce symptoms and improve the nerve function in your feet.Your doctor may prescribe:


Amitriptyline: This medication, originally used as an antidepressant, effectively treats neuropathic pain. You'll be started on the lowest dose, 25 mg a day. You can gradually increase the dosage to 150 mg per day. Always take the medication before going to bed. This drug should not be prescribed if you have a history of suicide risk.Pregabalin: This sedative is usually prescribed for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. You will start with the lowest possible dose, and increase it as your doctor suggests. The maximum dosage is 50 to 100 mg, taken three times per day by mouth. Maximum dosing may be increased over time to 600mg/day, but dosage over this amount isn't effective.Duloxetine: This medication is usually prescribed for pain associated with neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. The dosage starts at 60 mg orally. The dosage can be doubled and your doctor will review the treatment after two months. While you can double the dosage, most doses over 60 mg a day are rarely more effective and may actually cause other problems.Combination therapies: Your doctor may recommend combining several medications such as TCA, venlafaxine, or tramadol. These can provide better results for neuropathy than any single medication alone., Your doctor may prescribe long-acting opiates to treat the pain of your neuropathy. This is usually determined on an individual basis, because side effects include dependence (addiction), tolerance (they become less effective over time), and headaches.Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be prescribed to treat a chronic type of neuropathy (dysimmune neuropathy) that may be resistant to other treatments.

, Depending on the cause of your neuropathy, your doctor may recommend a decompressive surgery. This will release pressure from entrapped nerves which will let them function correctly. Decompressive surgery is often done for carpal tunnel syndrome. But, certain types of hereditary neuropathy that cause issues in the foot and ankle can also benefit from decompressive surgery.


Amyloid peripheral neuropathy may be treated by a liver transplant, since this type of neuropathy is caused by metabolic liver problems., If you aren't diabetic and have no other recognizable systemic disease then the neuropathy might be caused by deficiencies of vitamins E, B1, B6, and B12.However, talk with your doctor before taking a vitamin supplement. Your doctor will need to diagnose the cause of your neuropathy before advising supplements or medications.


To get more vitamins from a healthy diet, eat plenty of green leafy vegetables, egg yolks, and liver.

, Neuropathy usually develops many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Good diabetic control can prevent or halt neuropathy. But once developed, it may not be possible to fully reverse the condition. Your doctor will focus on managing the diabetes and controlling the pain caused by neuropathy.It's important to keep your blood glucose level in check. Target blood glucose level is 70-130 mg/dL at fasting and below 180 mg/dL two hours after breakfast. You should also keep your blood pressure under control.

, You may notice less sensation and feeling in your neuropathic feet. This may make you more prone to injuries like cuts, pricks or scratches. Always wear socks or shoes when inside or outdoors. Repeated injury to your feet can easily lead to ulcer formation that is difficult to heal. You should also ask your doctor to examine your feet when you go in for regular visits.Use loose fitting footwear such as a pair of backless slippers, but avoid shoes, sandals, or flip-flops that offer little support. Tight shoes may compromise adequate blood supply to pressure points of your feet and lead to ulcer formation in those areas.
Keep your nails at a good length. This will prevent ingrown toenails. Just use caution when clipping. To avoid accidental cuts, don't use blades.

, Wash the ulcer area with warm salt water. Take a piece of sterile gauze and pour a little saline over it. Use this to clean the dead tissue over the ulcer. Then, dry the area and cover the ulcer with a sterile dressing. Take care to change the dressing once or twice a day, more often if it gets wet. If there is a foul smell from the ulcer, return to your doctor immediately because a bad smell indicates infection which can be serious.Immediately inform your doctor that you have ulcers. If they're small, they can be treated easily with dressings and antibiotics. However, large ulcers can be difficult to heal. They can even lead to amputation of toes or feet.

, The severity of neuropathic pain varies widely. If you're experiencing mild to moderate pain, take over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. can be treated with over the counter analgesics. You may take 400 mg of ibuprofen or 300 mg of aspirin two to three times a day.Do not forget to take anti-peptic drugs because the analgesics (Ibuprofen, etc.) are irritating to the stomach. For example, you could take 150mg of ranitidine twice daily before meals.

, Neuropathy due to kidney, liver or endocrine diseases can be corrected by treating the underlying disease. If you have nerve compression or local problems, it can be improved by physiotherapy or surgery.


You should always talk with your doctor about neuropathy you're experiencing and before taking any supplements.

Undergo physical therapy.,
Use a brace.,
Try a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) device.,
Treat any gait problems.",How to Treat MS‐Related Foot Drop1," Physical therapy is a common treatment for foot drop. During physical therapy, you will be given exercises that work and strengthen the muscles needed to lift your foot and toes. This therapy may be done at home or a physical therapy office.You may be instructed to do stretching exercises as well.
Physical therapy is often combined with other treatments.
This treatment is often covered under insurance, though you may have to pay a copayment.;
, A brace or ankle-foot orthosis is commonly used to treat MS related foot drop. This brace fits around the lower part of the leg and foot. It helps supports the ankle by keeping the foot and ankle in a fixed position.This helps the foot not drop down when you walk.


Wear a sock between your skin and brace or AFO (ankle-foot orthotic) to prevent chafing. You will need to wear shoes that will fit over the brace.
You can get braces that are custom-fitted for your foot and ankle.
These braces are often partially covered by insurance. Check with your insurance company to see what they cover., Functional Electrical Stimulation devices are new devices used to treat foot drop. FES devices emit low-level electrical impulses to nerves in the body that tell the legs to raise the foot. The two FES devices available are WalkAide and NESS L300.These devices are not covered by most insurances.
They are very expensive, costing approximately $5000.
FES devices don’t work for everyone. They won’t work if the MS interferes with the nerves needed to tell the leg to move.

, Sometimes, when people get foot drop, their walking gait is altered. This can cause even more difficulties in walking and lead to tripping or unbalanced muscles. Your physical therapist can identify if your gait is affected and work with you using exercises to correct your gait."
"
Take a rest.,
Ice your shins.,
Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Go to the doctor.",How to Treat Shin Splints1," Since shin splints are almost always caused by exercising too much, the first thing to do is ramp down your workout routine to something you can accomplish without pain. Resting allows the swollen muscles along your shin bone to heal.


Avoid sprinting, running, or walking too quickly while recovering from shin splints.
If you still want to exercise during your recovery period, cross-train with low-impact exercises like biking or swimming.;
, Shin splints are most commonly caused by inflamed muscles, and icing them will ease the pain and reduce inflammation.


Fill a food storage bag with ice, seal it, and wrap it in a thin towel. Apply it to your shins in 20-minute intervals.
Don't apply ice directly to your body, since you could damage your skin.

, Drugs containing ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.


Make sure you take only the recommended dosage, since NSAIDs can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and ulcers.Don't medicate with NSAIDs as a way to kill the pain to allow you to exercise as usual; that's treating the symptom, not the problem, and you'll only make your shin splints worse.

, If your shin splints are making it difficult to get up and walk without pain, you should seek medical care. You may have fractures in your bones that are causing your legs to hurt. In rare cases, surgery is required to treat stress fractures and other causes of shin splints."
"
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Take medication.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Treat MS‐Related Foot Drop2," If you believe you have foot drop, you should see your doctor. Your doctor may suggest that you see a neurologist if you don’t already have one on your care team. The doctor or neurologist will assess you to determine if you have foot drop. If you are diagnosed, you will work with them on a treatment plan.


You may also contact your MS nurse if one is part of your care team.

, You may be prescribed Ampyra, which is a medication used to help walking problems associated with MS. This drug helps to improve the speed of your walk, which can alleviate foot drop.This medication is not fit for those who suffer from seizures and kidney disease.
If you suffer from spasticity that results in foot drop, you may be given medication to help with that while you undergo physical therapy.

, In extreme cases, your doctor may suggest surgery. This is used when the foot is permanently paralyzed and the muscles damaged. One surgery includes tendons from the unaffected leg are moved to the leg affected by foot drop. Another fuses the ankle and foot bones so they cannot move to create stability.Talk to your doctor about surgery. It is only used in severe or long-term cases.

"
"
Wear the correct footwear.,
Pay attention while walking.,
Remove obstacles and tripping hazards in your home.",How to Treat MS‐Related Foot Drop3," Proper footwear is very helpful when you have foot drop. Wearing properly fitting shoes can lessen symptoms while you undergo treatment. Make sure you wear shoes with flat soles that are not too big on your feet. Go for shoes with shoestrings or velcro instead of slip on shoes. This allows you to tighten the shoes and make them more secure.Try wearing boots since they can help keep your ankle supported.
Don’t wear shoes that are clunky or heavy. This can tire out your leg, ankle, and foot, which can lead to more problems.

, When you have foot drop, you are at a higher risk of falling. To help reduce this risk and avoid a potential injury, pay close attention to your surroundings when you walk. Look at the path to see where you are stepping and avoid any surprises.Watch for anything that might cause you to trip. This may include uneven surfaces, debris in your path, stairs, or hills.
Take easy routes with few tripping hazards and obstacles.

, To make sure you do not injure yourself at home, eliminate any potential obstacles or tripping hazards that may cause you to fall. This means you may need to move things along walls and out of the main pathways you walk through your home.Remove rugs and mats, use non-slip versions, or tape them to the floor. Mats and rugs pose a potential tripping hazards.
Move cables and cords out of the floor. It is easy to trip over these things.

"
"
Be prepared to try different treatments.,
Keep an open mind.,
Identify the symptoms of foot drop.",How to Treat MS‐Related Foot Drop4," Generally, foot drop is easily treated. This is usually done through physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, or other treatments. However, the first treatment may not work for you. Often, it takes multiple attempts to find the one that is right for you and your lifestyle.Don’t get discouraged if the first treatment is not successful. Foot drop is treatable once the right treatment is found for you.

, Most of the time, there is a treatment available to help foot drop. Working with your doctor and physical therapist, you will come up with a treatment tailored to your specific MS condition and your lifestyle. However, not everyone is accepting of treatments. To ensure success, don’t be reluctant to try treatments suggested by your care team.Many people just assume foot drop means they cannot walk. This is not true. It may be a challenge, but one that you can overcome with the help of your care team. For example, your physical therapist may recommend using a cane to improve your stability and prevent falls. Work with your physical therapist to learn the proper way to use a cane for foot drop.
Adapting your body and your way of doing a certain activity can ensure you keep doing what you enjoy.

, Early detection is essential for successfully treating foot drop. When you suffer from foot drop, your toes drop down when you lift your leg to take a step instead of pointing up. This causes you to drag your foot and toes on the ground. You may have experienced a scrape on your toes due to this, and your toes may slap against the ground.You may notice a high stepping gait to try to correct the dragging of your foot.
You may swing your hip in an exaggerated way to keep the toes from dragging the ground.
Your foot may appear limp.
You may find that your foot is numb, tingles, or is painful.
You may trip often when climbing stairs, stepping off a curb, or walking across an uneven surface.

"
"
Stretch in the morning.,
Strengthen the shin muscles.,
Return to running slowly.",How to Treat Shin Splints2," Keep your muscles limber by stretching them before you go about your day. Try these stretches to help your shin splints heal more quickly:


Do a stair stretch. Stand on a step or a stair so that your toes hang over the edge. Point your toes downward, then stretch them toward the ceiling. Repeat 20 times, rest for a few seconds, then repeat 20 more times.
Stretch by kneeling. Kneel with the tops of your feet flat against the floor, then slowly sit back onto your feet. You should feel your shin muscles stretching.
Stretch your Achilles tendon if you feel pain on the inside of the shin, which is most common. If you feel pain on the outside of the leg, stretch your calf muscle.

, Doing these exercises a few times a day instead of running will help heal your muscles in no time.


Trace shapes or the alphabet on the floor with your toes, while in a sitting position.
Walk on your heels for 30 seconds at a time and then switch to regular walking for another 30 seconds. Repeat 3 or 4 times.

, Increase your mileage by no more than 10 percent each week. If you feel the shin splints coming back, cut back on running until the pain goes away.

"
"
Warm up before exercising.,
Work out on soft surfaces.,
Replace your running shoes.,
Try orthotics.",How to Treat Shin Splints3," Make a habit of warming up before running, sprinting, or playing sports like soccer and basketball that require a lot of heaving footwork.


Do a light one-mile jog before going on longer runs.Walk briskly for a block or two before you break into a run.

, Shin splints can be caused by running on pavement or concrete surfaces, since the shin bears the brunt of the impact.


Try running on dirt paths or grass instead of the road or the sidewalk.
If you must run on the road, mix up your routine with biking, swimming and other cross training exercises so you aren't pounding the pavement every day.

, If your shoes are worn out, new shoes with more cushioning can help disperse stress on the shin. If you have an overpronation or over supination, buy shoes designed to help with this problem.

, If you're prone to getting shin splints, you may want to ask your doctor to fit your feet with orthotics or arch supports. These are special shoe inserts that will change the way you strike the ground with your feet and prevent your legs from getting overstrained.

Wear wider shoes.",How to Treat Athlete's Foot," If you come in contact with a contaminated surface and then provide a good environment for fungus to grow, you be at increased risk for developing athlete’s foot. Contaminated surfaces may include swimming pools, locker rooms or showers where you walk barefoot after someone with an athlete’s foot infection. Certain behaviors can also predispose you to developing a fungal infection on your feet or toes, such as:Wearing tight shoes with limited air flow.
Wearing shoes with plastic liners.
Leaving your feet wet or moist for long periods of time.
Having sweaty feet often.
Developing a nail or skin injury.;
, Most of these symptoms revolve around the skin irritation that the fungus causes. There are three kinds of athlete’s foot that may have slightly different symptoms to look out for. Symptoms can be mild, moderate or even severe. Some symptoms, such as itching, can become worse as soon as you remove socks and shoes.Symptoms of athlete's foot can include:Itching and burning.
Peeling or flaking skin.
Cracking skin.
Bleeding.
Pain of the infected area.
Areas of skin that look pinker/redder than the rest of the foot (if you have light skin).

, Look at both feet close up under good lighting so you won’t miss anything. Pay special attention to areas between the toes and the soles of your feet. If you notice any skin that is red and peeling or dry flakes on your skin and are experiencing some of the symptoms mentioned in this article, you should begin treatment.

, Toe web infection is a form of athlete’s foot that is frequently found between the fourth and fifth toes. You will need to look for signs of athlete's foot in these areas, such as scaly, peeling or cracking skin. Bacteria can also infect the area causing further damage to the skin.

, Moccasin-type infection may begin as a very mild thickening or cracking on the heel or other areas on the bottom of your foot. It can gradually become worse, infecting toenails so that they also thicken, crack or fall out. Be sure to check your toenails for signs of irritation or fungal infection.

, This type of fungal infection can cause fluid-filled blisters to occur suddenly on your foot. The blisters can usually be found on the bottom of your foot. A bacterial infection can coincide with your vesicular type infection, making symptoms much worse., Fungal infections are opportunistic and can appear anywhere that conditions allow them to thrive. You should always wash your hands thoroughly after handling infected areas on your feet.


Fungal infections can spread to your hands, especially if you pick at areas on your foot infected with athlete’s foot.
Athlete’s foot can spread to your toenails and fingernails. It is more difficult to treat toenail infections than skin infections on your foot.
Athlete’s foot can develop into jock itch when it infects your groin area. Know that the fungus that causes athlete’s foot can contaminate materials like a towel or be transferred by your hands if, for example, you touch your infected foot and then scratch your groin area.

, A medical provider can often diagnose athlete’s foot by examining the infected area of your foot. They can look for telltale visual signs that point to the fungal infection. Your doctor may also perform some tests to confirm a diagnosis, such as:


Taking skin scrapings from the infected area in order to take a look at the cells under a microscope.
Using a black-light to look at your feet and see if the light shows fungus on your foot.
Sending a sample of skin cells to the laboratory for further testing., There are many nonprescription antifungal creams, solutions, gels, sprays, ointments, swabs or powders that can be effective for treating athlete’s foot. Some take one to two weeks to work, while others must be used for four to eight weeks before they get rid of the fungal infection. Faster-acting medications tend to be a little more expensive than the others but require less medication to finish treating athlete’s foot.


Over-the-counter topical antifungals usually contain one of the following as its active ingredient: clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine or tolnaftate. Treatment usually lasts from one to eight weeks, depending on the medication you choose.

, Wash your hands before and after treating athlete’s foot. The area should be dry before you place the medication directly onto the rash as well as some surrounding areas. Even if your rash disappears, the fungus could still be on your skin, so keep using the medicine.It is a good idea to continue using anti-fungal powders and creams for one to two weeks after fungus has cleared up to ensure that the infection does not return.
Always use the medication as you are instructed on the box, tube or pamphlet that comes with the medication. Don’t skip doses, and don’t finish using the medication before the directions recommend—even if symptoms disappear before then.
Never tear off skin that is flaking. You could damage healthy surrounding skin and spread the fungal infection.

, This solution sometimes used for skin conditions is usually available over-the-counter and has astringent and antibacterial properties. It can be particularly useful for treating a vesicular infection.


Follow the directions, and soak your foot several times a day for at least three days. When all the blister fluid has dried up, you can move on to applying an antifungal topical medication to the infected area.You can also put Burow’s solution on a cloth or other compress and apply it to the infected area.
Another common remedy you can try is a solution that is 2/3 warm water and 1/3 vinegar.

, Fungi thrive in warm, damp environments. Your feet tend to be an ideal breeding ground for athlete's foot. Try hard to ensure that your feet are dry throughout the day.


Change your socks and your shoes as often as you need to keep your feet dry. If your socks get damp at all, it's time to change them. Put on clean, cotton socks every time. Synthetic fibers aren't as good at wicking away moisture as cotton is.
One trick is to take a silica packet (they often come in beef jerky packets, for example) and stick it inside your sock for the day. It may be a little uncomfortable, but silica is great at wicking away moisture — that's why they're put to use in beef jerky packets.
You can use talcum or antifungal powder on your feet and inside your shoes to help combat fungal infections.
Wear open-toed shoes or sandals as much as possible.

, Both of these natural remedies may help treat athlete's foot if applied regularly. This is because both tea tree oil and garlic contain antifungal compounds useful for killing fungal infections. Though tea tree oil and garlic may reduce symptoms of athlete’s foot, the infection may not be completely destroyed.


Be aware that these natural remedies have not been proven effective by scientific testing. Evidence supporting the use of tea tree oil and/or garlic is anecdotal, or based on personal accounts.

, If you have a very severe or resistant fungal infection, a doctor can prescribe prescription topical or oral (by mouth) antifungal medications. Some prescription antifungals can cause side effects. Talk to your doctor about the medications he or she wants you to take.


Prescription strength topical antifungals include medications that may contain butenafine, clotrimazole or naftifine.
The pill form of prescription antifungals include fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine. You usually have to take these pills for two to eight weeks, depending on which medication you are prescribed.

, Since the athlete's foot fungus is infectious, create a barrier between your feet and a potential vector for transmission. Never walk barefoot in public places, especially areas that tend to be warm and damp.


Always dry feet off completely after bathing or swimming before putting your shoes back on.

, Air-dry shoes for 24 hours at minimum before wearing them again. The fungus can live for a time inside your shoes, so you definitely don’t want to keep re-infecting yourself. To make sure that your shoes don't become vectors for infection, wear one set of shoes one day and another set the next.


Buy new shoes if you have to.

, Anything that you use on your feet while infected must be disinfected with bleach or another cleaner. This includes nail tools, shoes, socks and anything else that has touched your feet. The last thing you want is to re-infect your feet after you have spent so much time trying to treat them.


You should use very hot water and bleach to kill athlete’s foot fungi in clothing and shoes.

, Tight shoes do not allow air to flow around your feet. This can make it easy for fungus to grow. Something else you can do is to use lamb's wool between your toes to keep them separated when wearing your shoes. Lamb's wool can be found in your local drug store of foot care center.

Try a massage therapist.",How to Treat Minor Leg Pain," If you feel minor leg pain while playing a sport, working out at the gym or being active in general, then take a break and rest it for at least a few hours. Most cases of minor leg pain is muscle strain or cramping from over-exertion, so rest is a good remedy most of the time.If the pain quickly fades away, then return to your activity. If not, try some of the advice in the following steps.


Although some leg cramps and mild muscle strain can resolve within a few hours, you may have to rest for a few days before resuming athletic activities.
Bed rest and complete inactivity is not considered helpful for most musculoskeletal injuries nowadays, so some light walking and movement for house chores is recommended.;
, While you're resting your leg, try to elevate it in order to deter swelling from forming.Most injuries to the muscles, ligaments and bones of the leg involve inflammation, which collects (pools) in the lower leg and causes more discomfort and problems with walking. Therefore, elevate your painful leg with a footstool when you sit, or use extra pillows while you lie on the couch or in bed.


Elevating your leg sort of cancels out the effects of gravity and prevents water-like fluid from pooling in your lower leg and foot.
Raising your injured leg above the level of your heart is ideal, although that's obviously difficult while sitting. Lying flat on your back with your leg elevated is probably the easiest and most comfortable position.

, Since most minor leg injuries involve strained or tight muscles, take the time to do some leg stretches after you've rested them for a short period of time. Stretching elongates muscle fibers, increases flexibility and promotes better circulation, all of which can alleviate minor pain or discomfort.Pinpointing where your leg pain is coming from will help you to choose the most effective stretch. All stretches should be held for 30 seconds and repeated three to five times daily until the pain fades away.


If your pain is coming from your hamstring muscle (directly below your buttocks), then bending over at the waist and trying to touch your toes is a good stretch.
If your pain is in your thigh (quadriceps muscles), then bend your knee and pull your foot up with your hand so that the heel comes close to your butt.
If the pain is in your calf muscle, then lean against a wall with your feet flat on the floor. Move your feet away from the wall (about 3 feet or so) until you feel a nice stretch in your calves.

, If it seems obvious that your leg pain is related to a minor injury while playing sports or working out at the gym, then applying some sort of cold therapy is an effective way of reducing the inflammation and pain. Apply ice or something cold to where you think the pain is coming from for up to 15 minutes at a time, three to five per day for the first few days.Ice shrinks surface blood vessels and prevents swelling.


Crushed ice or ice cubes is ideal, but frozen gel packs or bags of frozen veggies work well also. Whatever you use, always wrap it in a thin cloth to avoid frost bite on your skin.
Once you apply the ice to your leg, take a Tensor or Ace stretchy bandage and wrap it around the area tightly — but don't cut off your circulation and make your foot numb. It will keep the ice in place and the compression will further reduce the swelling.

, If you can't seem to pinpoint why or when your leg started to hurt, and the pain feels more crampy, achy and/or restless, then take a warm bath. The moist heat of a bath will open up blood vessels, promote better circulation and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your legs, which is ideal for tired or over-worked muscles, tendons and ligament.The warmth of a hot bath also decreases muscle spasms, alleviates chronic pain and can improve flexibility.
Adding Epsom salt to your warm bath may be even more effective, as the magnesium-rich salt can soothe tight muscles quickly. A few cups of the salt into your bath water should be enough.
However, remember that warm baths are not recommended for acute (sudden) injuries that involve lots of inflammation.

, In addition to over-exertion and strain, muscle cramping is also caused by dehydration — either not drinking enough water or sweating too much on a hot day.Thus, if you notice muscle cramps on a warm day along with moderate-to-severe thirst, dry mouth / lips, mild headache and a general lack of energy, you're likely in need of some water. Keep in mind though, that cramps from dehydration typically affect both legs at the same time.


Aim for at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of purified water each day — more if you're really active or it's hot and humid outside.
Lack of water is not the only trigger of muscle cramps. Sweating also removes mineral salts (potassium, sodium, magnesium) from your body, which the muscles need to contract and relax normally.
To regain electrolytes, drink some fresh fruit and/or vegetables juices, such as orange, lemonade, tomato or cucumber.

, If none of the above-mentioned home remedies seem to alleviate your minor leg pain, then consider taking some OTC medication, such as painkillers or anti-inflammatories. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is effective for general pain control, whereas ibuprofen (Advil) also reduces inflammation, but both are relatively safe to take for short-term relief of leg discomfort if you read the instructions and take appropriate dosages.For most non-serious causes of minor leg pain (strains, sprains, bruises, cramps) medication shouldn't be needed for much more than a few days.
If OTC medication is the only home remedy that makes your leg feel better, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor to have it looked at. It may be more serious than you think.

, Sharp shooting pain often doesn't represent a problem in your leg, but rather an issue in your low back or hip. Twinges of pain that shoot down the back of your leg is called sciatica and usually caused by a bulging or herniated disc between your spinal bones.See your doctor or chiropractor for a physical exam and spinal x-rays to rule out a back problem.
Shooting leg pain can also be caused by arthritic and/or slightly malpositioned hip or spinal joints.
Sharp, shooting or ""electric"" pain represents nerve irritation, whereas achy pain and soreness usually indicates muscle pain.

, Foot and leg issues are common with diabetics because the high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood is toxic and irritation to small blood vessels and nerve endings.If your lower leg or foot is painful and numb (reduced sensations), then you may not be controlling your blood sugar as well as you should.


See your doctor and get your blood glucose levels measured by a simple blood test. Leg pain is often an early sign to people who are undiagnosed with diabetes.
Being overweight and a heavy drinker of alcohol are two major risk factors for diabetes.
People with diabetes usually develop symptoms and pain in both legs and the condition gets worse slowly with time depending on how well the condition is managed.

, Infections in the leg from puncture wounds or cuts / abrasions are not uncommon and often start with minor pain before escalating and getting worse. Other signs to look out for include swelling and redness, black and blue streaks, mild-to-moderate fever, nausea, rapidly increasing pain and great difficulty walking.See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. If your doctor is booked up or unavailable, go to a walk-in clinic or hospital emergency department for treatment.
Stepping on sharp objects, sports injuries, foot trauma, cuts from a pedicure and severe blisters from ill-fitting shoes can all develop into bacterial infections that quickly involve most of the leg.
Insect, spider and snake bites can also cause leg pain and mimic the symptoms of infections. They may also need medical attention.

, One of the more dangerous causes of mild leg pain (at least initially) is a blood clot that gets stuck in a vein or artery within your leg.Blood clots (also called a deep vein thrombosis) starts out as minor pain and swelling in the lower leg, but quickly escalates. Severe pain, swelling and discoloration quickly develops within minutes to hours and necessitates medical attention.


Your doctor will give you some blood ""thinning"" or anti-clotting medication, but may also have to operate and remove the clot surgically in some cases.
Smoking, long-term use of birth control pills and inactivity are major risk factors for developing blood clots.

, Another common cause of mild-to-moderate leg pain is arthritis of the ankle, knee or hips joints. Wear and tear arthritis (called osteoarthritis) develops gradually and includes achy pain that's worse with activity, reduced range of motion in the involved joint, general stiffness and grinding or clicking sounds with movement.Your doctor or chiropractor can take x-rays to determine if you have osteoarthritis in your leg(s). Bone spurs and joint erosion are hallmark signs on x-ray.
Osteoarthritis is more common in the elderly (especially those who are overweight) and can affect the joints of one or both legs.

, If the home remedies don't help or alleviate your minor leg pain, then make an appointment with your doctor for an exam and potential blood tests. Your doctor will take an x-ray if they think the problem is caused by your leg bones or joints. Bone problems can include hairline (stress) fractures, infection, tumors or osteoporosis (brittle bones).Joint problems can include arthritis, infection or dislocations.


Your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics for any infections, stronger drugs if you're having trouble coping with arthritis or muscle relaxants for severe cramps.
Your doctor can prescribe you medicine (or adjust your dosage) if chronic diabetes is the cause of your leg pain.

, Chiropractors are musculoskeletal specialists who focus on the health of the spine, but also peripheral joints and muscles of the arms and legs.Chiropractors can adjust or realign any joints of the low back, hip or leg that may be causing or contributing to your problem. They can also recommend specific exercises and stretches to alleviate your discomfort.


A chiropractor can rule out if a spinal disc problem or joint is causing issues in your leg. Spinal adjustments can be effective for sciatica relief and can sometimes reduce the need for surgery.
Chiropractic adjustments often cause a clicking or cracking sound, which does not injure bones or joints.

, Considering that most minor leg pain is caused by muscle strain, tightness or overuse, it makes sense to see a muscle specialist such as a professional massage therapist. Massage therapy is beneficial for reducing muscle pain and tension, improving circulation and reducing stress.Start with a 30-minute massage and ask the therapist to focus mainly on your leg, although some work on your buttocks and low back may be a good idea too.
There are different styles and pressures of massage. Deep tissue massage is often effective for muscle strains and tightness, but you may prefer a gentler form such as Swedish technique.

Wearing ill-fitting shoes can prolong the issue and possibly make your hammertoe worse.Choose a shoe that fits you properly. Do not wear shoes that are too big when you're suffering from hammertoe. You should also aim for shoes with a wide toe box, as this can add comfort.
Choose shoes with a soft interior.
Do not wear high heels when you're suffering from hammertoe.;
, Hammertoes may develop painful swelling. If this is the case with your hammertoe, an ice pack can help. Apply an ice pack to your toe a few times a day until swelling goes down.If you don't have a commercial ice pack, you can place some ice cubes in a plastic bag to treat hammertoe or use a bag of frozen vegetables, like peas or corn.
Never apply ice or an ice pack directly to your toe. Make sure you wrap it in a towel before placing it over your foot.

, You can buy a hammertoe pad at the drug store. This is a pad that you would place in your shoe. This pad is designed to protect the infected toe by providing support and pain relief. Follow the instructions on the package in regards to use.Make sure you get a non-medicated pad. Hammertoes can become infected and you do not want to use medication on your toe without consulting a doctor.

, Hammertoes may develop thick callouses or corns. Many drugstores sell over-the-counter corn removal products, but these are best avoided when you're suffering from hammertoe. These products can cause rashes and foot irritation, worsening your condition., Hammertoe may clear up at home; however, many patients eventually require doctor's care. If you notice any of the following complications, seek medical treatment:The development of thick blisters around your toe
Worsening pain
Difficulty walking
Difficulty putting on shoes

, If you have any of the above complications, or if your hammertoe fails to clear up on its own, seek medical assistance. Make an appointment with your regular physician or a podiatrist to assess and treat your hammertoe.Before going into the doctor's office, take stock of your symptoms. You should be able to tell the doctor where the pain comes from and what activities make it worse. You should also come in with a list of your existing medications. If you have a family history of hammertoe, mention this to your doctor.
Your doctor will perform a routine exam on your foot. She will ask you a series of questions about your symptoms. Your doctor will also want to know what kind of physical activity you engage in and what kinds of shoes you wear.

, In most cases, your doctor will recommend a foot exercise program to treat the issue. Hammertoe, while irritating, is rarely serious enough to require surgery. Your doctor will lay out an exercise regimen for you at the office.Your doctor may advise a variety of exercises. You may be asked to pick up marbles with your toe or to crumple a towel with your toe.
The type of exercises, and how often you should do them, do depends on your specific hammertoe. Make sure you get detailed instructions from your doctor. If anything is unclear in the doctor's office, ask your doctor for clarification before you go home.

, In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to treat hammertoe. Your joints may need to be straightened surgically. In some cases, hammertoe is caused by joints fusing together. In this case, joints will need to be separated surgically and some bones may be removed.Hammertoe surgery is usually not major surgery. Most patients will go home the same day of the operation.
Your toe may be stiffer or shorter after surgery. Talk to your doctor about the recovery period and how to best care for yourself.

, If you have corns on your feet, these can exasperate hammertoes. If you develop corns or callouses on the tops of your toes, treat them with pumice stones. You can purchase pumice stones at most drugstores.Take a warm bath or shower prior to using pumice stones.
When you get out of the bath or shower, file down callouses with your pumice stones.
Use an exfoliating lotion after using pumice stones.

, Footwear is one of the most important ways to reduce the reoccurrence of hammertoes. If you're prone to hammertoes, select footwear primarily for comfort. Do not wear shoes that pinch or cause aches and pains.Some shoes have pointed toes. These should be avoided in order to best treat hammertoe. Go for shoes with roomier toe boxes.
Lower heels are best. You should also get shoes with straps or laces so you can adjust them for comfort as needed.

, Some people are tempted to purchase shoes that do not quite fit if they enjoy the style; however, you should never wear shoes that do not fit you, especially not for long hours throughout the day. In addition to causing hammertoe, ill-fitting shoes can cause other foot problems.If you're unsure of your shoe size, go to a shoe store and have a worker fit you.

, Your feet swell throughout the day, especially if you walk a lot during the course of the day; therefore, it's a good idea to shop for shoes in the evening or late afternoon. You want to make sure you choose a shoe size that can accommodate your feet for a full day."

Check the condition of the toe immediately after the injury.,
Clean and disinfect any abrasions or cuts.,
Apply ice to reduce swelling.,
Avoid putting pressure on the toe.,
Make sure your shoe has enough space for the toe.,
Treat lingering pain with over-the-counter medications.,
Elevate especially bad toes.",How to Treat a Stubbed Toe1," The first step to treating a stubbed toe is to see how bad the damage is. Carefully and gently remove the shoe and sock on the injured foot. Examine the injured toe, taking care not to injure it further by handling it roughly (a friend can help here). Look for the following signs:


A ""bent"" or ""misaligned"" appearance
Bleeding
A broken or misplaced nail
Heavy swelling and/or discoloration
Depending on which (if any) of the above signs you see, the treatment for your toe can differ. See below for specific suggestions.
If it is too painful to remove your shoe and sock, you probably have a fracture or sprain in your toe and/or foot. This is not a dangerous condition, but you should still see a doctor to receive treatment.;
, If you notice any spots on the toe where the skin has been broken, you will want to clean them promptly to avoid infection. This includes cuts, scrapes, abrasions, and breaks in the nail. Carefully wash the toe with soap and warm water. Dry the toe gently with a clean cloth or paper towel, then rub a little anti-bacterial cream onto any breaks in the skin. Protect the toe with a clean bandage.


Replace the bandage every day as the toe heals.See How to Clean a Wound for step-by-step information.

, Most stubbed toes will be followed by at least a little painful swelling. This can make the toe awkward, unwieldy, and even more vulnerable to pain. Luckily, it's easy to reduce the swelling with a cold compress. There are many ways to do this — for instance, you can use a gel ice pack, a bag of ice or even an unopened bag of frozen vegetables.


Whatever you use for your cold compress, wrap it in a towel or rag before pressing it into the skin. Apply the ice pack for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, waiting about 10 to 15 minutes before applying it again. Direct, prolonged ice-on-skin contact can further damage the skin, making your injury worse.See our article on cold compresses for more detailed information.

, Even mundane, day-to-day activities can be painful when you're walking on a stubbed toe. To reduce further pain and swelling, try to shift some of your weight to your heel as you walk and stand. This can be a difficult balance to strike, as putting all of your weight on your heel can make walking awkward and cause soreness over time. Try to take just enough pressure off of your toe to avoid pain when walking.


Once the swelling has subsided in your injured toe, light cushioning (for instance, a gel insole) can help minimize pain from walking.
If the pain in your toe doesn't subside after an hour or two, you may want to take a break from physical activities like sports, etc. for a few days until you no longer feel pain.

, Tight shoes can make a painful, swollen toe even more irritated. If you can, wear a loose, comfortable pair of shoes after your injury to protect the toe from more pressure. If you don't have a replacement pair of shoes available, you can try loosening the laces.


Open-toed shoes like sandals and flip-flops can be the best choices of all — not only do they put no pressure on the top and sides of the toe, but they also allow easy access for cold compresses, bandage changes, and so on.

, If the pain from the stubbed toe doesn't subside on its own, over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers can be a good temporary solution. Here, you have many choices. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are both available in many varieties from nearly any grocery store or pharmacy.Be sure to follow any and all dosage instructions on the medicine's packaging. Even (OTC) medicines can have dangerous side effects when taken in large doses.

, Another great way to reduce swelling is to elevate the injured toe above the body when you are sitting or resting. For instance, you might try propping it up on a stack of pillows when you lay down. Putting a swollen injury above the rest of your body makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood to it. This causes blood to gradually flow out of the swollen area, reducing swelling. While it's basically impossible to do this while standing and walking, it's smart to take the time to elevate your injured toe whenever you plan on sitting or laying down for a long time.

Ask your child where he is experiencing pain in his feet.,
Determine if your child injured his foot.,
Note if your child complains of itchiness or burning on the skin of his feet.,
Examine your child’s outdoor shoes.,
Look at your child’s feet for bunions or ingrown toenails.,
Check if your child walks on his toes or with a limp.,
Notice if the your child’s arches disappear when he stands with his feet flat on the ground.,
Take your child to emergency room if he cannot put any weight on his feet, or if your child has foot pain due to an injury or fever and a limp.",How to Treat Foot Pain in Children1," Have your child point to the area or areas on his feet where he is feeling a sharp pain or throbbing. He may also have pain in other areas of his legs, like his knees, his ankles, or his calf muscles. Ask him to point out the specific areas of pain. This will help you determine where the pain is originating on his feet and legs, and determine the possible causes of his pain.If he notes the pain is in his heel, he may have Sever's disease. Sever's disease, also known as “painful heel” or pediatric heel, is caused by disturbances in the growth plate of your child’s foot and is common in kids who are active in sports, especially during early puberty.
If he complains of pain on his entire foot, as well as in his ankles and calf muscles, he may suffer from flat footedness.;
, Falling on the foot, twisting it, injuring it while kicking, or dropping something on it can cause sprains, strains, contusions or fractures that lead to pain. See your health care provider or go to the emergency room if your child has pain after an injury or has sudden foot pain.


Limping does not necessarily indicate an injury in the foot. A small child may limp due to pain from an injury anywhere in the hips, leg, or foot.

, Your child may also complain of severe itchiness between his toes. The skin of his feet may appear scaly, flaky, or dry, and your child may also feel like his feet are burning or irritated. These are symptoms of athlete's foot. This skin issue is caused by a fungus that may have ended up on your child's feet due to expose to the fungi in a swimming pool, a gym, a locker room, or from contaminated socks or clothing.Athlete's foot is an unpleasant skin condition that will only get worse if it is not properly treated. You should bring your child to the doctor. She will then prescribe over the counter powders, ointments, and medicated creams.

, Some children suffer from foot pain due to improper running shoes or shoes that are too tight on their feet. Check inside your child’s shoes for any sharp patches or spots that may be rubbing against your child’s feet.Often, ill fitting shoes will contribute to surface pains like blisters and raw skin on your child’s feet. However, if your child feeling pain in the muscles and joints of his feet, there is likely a deeper issue with his feet.

, Bunions typically occur due to increased motion of the arch region of your child’s foot and will appear as a bump extending out of one side of the ball of your child’s foot. Your child may have inherited a genetic predisposition to bunions or he may have had a foot deformity at birth that was not properly diagnosed. If you suspect your child has bunions, take him to a podiatrist for treatment.To check if your child might be suffering from an ingrown toenail on his foot, examine his big toes to see if there is any redness or rawness around the skin of his big toe nail as well as areas where the nail is pinched against the skin. There are home remedies you can try to relieve pain caused by ingrown toenails. However, the best course of action is to take your child to your family doctor so he can treat the ingrown nail.
You should also check for plantar warts, which are common in children and can cause pain when walking on them. A pediatrician, podiatrist, or dermatologist can treat warts.

, Ask your child to take a few steps forward and watch him as he walks. If he seems to putting most of his weight on his toes or walking with a slight or pronounced limp, he may be suffering from a common foot problem for children: pediatric heel pain, also known as Sever's disease.Pediatric heel pain is caused by your child’s growing feet, as the bones in your child’s foot may be growing faster than his tendons and his heel bone (medically called the calcaneus). This gap between your child’s growth plate can lead to a weak area at the back of your child’s heel and pulling the tendon in your child’s feet. This then puts more stress on the growth plate in your child’s feet and can lead to heel pain.
If you suspect your child might be experiencing pediatric heel pain, it’s important you take him to your family doctor, who can recommend a podiatrist or orthopedic doctor. The doctor can examine your child’s feet and present treatment options. You may be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for heel pain problems. Catching pediatric heel pain early is the best way to prevent the development of lifelong foot pain and foot issues.

, This is a symptom of flat footedness, a foot issue that, when severe or causing symptoms, requires professional treatment. Flat footedness is a hereditary condition that can also lead to other symptoms such as:Tenderness, cramping, and pain in the foot, the leg or the knee.
Awkwardness or limping when walking.
A hard time finding shoes that feel comfortable.
Little energy to participate in a physical activity that requires running, jogging, or sprinting.

, If it becomes too painful for your child to put any weight at all on his feet, or if he has a burning pain in his feet, head to the nearest hospital or clinic. He may be suffering from a serious foot issue that needs immediate treatment."

Eat more yogurt.",How to Treat and Prevent Athlete's Foot1," Being a relatively common affliction, there are plenty of over-the-counter anti-fungal treatments available. Head to your local pharmacy or drugstore, and grab sprays or creams that focus on killing the fungus responsible for your discomfort. Apply daily for 3-6 weeks, even after visible symptoms dissipate to ensure the total elimination of the fungus from your system.;
, Using betadine to soak your feet will kill of the fungus causing your itching and burning. Grab a bottle of this over-the-counter medication, and add two capfuls with a quart of warm water. Soak your feet in the solution for 20 minutes on a daily basis, continuing until your symptoms disappear.

, So you’re not into using chemicals and don’t want to take a trip to the pharmacy - no worries! You can create an all natural foot soak using regular vinegar at home. Add one cup of regular or apple cider vinegar to two quarts of water, and let your feet absorb its healing goodness. Do this for 20-30 minutes on a daily basis.

, Tannic acid is one of the great bonuses black tea has to offer; its soothing qualities help to fight off fungi and heal your feet. Add 6 teabags of any black tea to a quart of warm water, and allow the mixture to brew. Soak your feet in the tea bath or dab it on several times a day with a cotton ball.

, Whether you want to make your house smell like fall in addition to killing fungus, or you just don’t have the ingredients for the aforementioned foot soaks, making a soak of cinnamon sticks is another all-natural method of killing the fungi. Soak 4-5 stick of cinnamon in a gallon of hot water to create a tea. Then, let your feet relax as the cinnamon naturally kicks the fungus out from between your toes.

, Although not as comfortable as a cinnamon bath or tea/toe steeping, soaking your feet in salt water might do the trick to kill your athlete's foot. Mix 1 teaspoon of regular table salt per every 1 cup of warm water. Allow the salt to dissolve, and soak your feet in the solution for 10-15 minutes.

, This fine powder works wonders at absorbing moisture. Sprinkle cornstarch onto your feet and between your toes to soak up excess moisture that the fungus is feeding off of. This process can be continued even after your athlete's foot disappears to maintain healthy, dry, fungi-free feet.

, Although strong in scent and taste, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of garlic make it a great choice for ridding your feet of irritating athlete's foot. Mince 1-2 cloves of garlic and mix with a teaspoon of olive oil to form a paste (you can add more garlic or less olive oil if your paste is not thick enough). Apply the paste to the affected area of your feet and along the edges of your toenails for 15-20 minutes. When finished, rinse the paste off with warm water and dry your feet completely.

, Not only will the acid in the lemon kill the bacteria and fungus on your feet, its sweet citrus scent will have your toes smelling fresh and clean. Mix the juice of one lemon with two ounces of water. Dab this solution onto the affected area of your feet with a cotton ball several times daily.

, The live cultures in yogurt are beneficial not only for your digestion, but also for treating athlete's foot! Look for yogurt advertising live cultures, specifically the bacteria acidophilus. Eat any flavor of this bacteria-filled yogurt at least once a day for the best results."

Consider acupuncture treatments.",How to Treat Bunions Naturally," Most bunions occur in women who habitually wear shoes that are too narrow for their feet.Narrow shoes tend to crowd the toes, particularly the big toe, and significantly increase your risk of developing bunions and other foot problems. Changing to shoes that have wider toe boxes, good arch support and conform to the shape of your feet can help prevent bunions and even thwart their progression, but it won't correct an already established bunion. In other words, switch to better shoes before the bunion gets too severe and creates significant symptoms.


Get fitted for your shoes by a salesperson later in the day because that's when your feet are larger, usually due to swelling and slight arch compression.
Wearing heels more than 2 inches high can force your body to tilt forward, which creates lots of pressure in the feet and toes — another risk factor for bunions.
About 90% of bunion cases involve women, mainly due to their poor choice of shoes.;
, Aside from a crooked appearance and compromised foot aesthetics, the main complaint of bunions is pain while walking (and sometimes even while at rest).The pain can be described as sharp and stabbing (like an acute joint sprain) or sometimes as dull and achy (similar to osteoarthritis). As such, it's important to control bunion pain, but you don't have to rely strictly on over-the-counter medications. There are a variety of herbal remedies that can combat pain and inflammation including turmeric, cat's claw, ginger root and willow bark — they can be taken as capsules or consumed as herbal tea.The effective doses for most herbal remedies are not well established and depend on many factors, such as purity and concentration.


Turmeric root has anti-inflammatory & analgesic (pain killing) properties and performs as well as ibuprofen in studies, but w/out side effects.Turmeric extract doses range from 300-600 mg 3x daily for joint pain.
Cat's claw extract doses range from 30-300 mg daily, and is used to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Ginger blocks COX-2 production and reduces inflammation much like the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Celebrex. At least 2,000 mg daily (divided doses) is needed to be effective for joint pain.
Willow bark was used in the late 1800s to make acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Extract doses range from 300-500 mg 3x daily.
Fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which also display anti-inflammatory properties. A dosage of 1,000 mg 2-3x daily can noticeably reduce inflammation and pain.Capsaicin (derived from cayenne peppers) reduces a chemical called substance-P, which contributes to the sensation of pain. It's usually applied as a cream a few times daily for a couple of days for noticeable effects.

, If you notice your toe joint is red, inflamed and quite tender after exercise or a day at work, then apply some cold therapy to it in order to reduce the swelling and numb the pain. The application of ice (or anything cold) is an effective natural treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal strains and sprains, including bunions, because it contracts small blood vessels and reduces the flow of blood and lymph fluid into the injured area.Cold therapy should be applied to your toe for 10-15 minutes every hour until the pain and swelling subside.


Always wrap ice, frozen gel packs or bags of veggies from the freezer in a thin towel to prevent irritation, ice burn or frostbite on your skin.
While you're icing your toe(s), elevate your foot on a stool or with some pillows in order to help combat the effects of gravity and help the swelling subside.
Cold therapy is best for acute injuries or flare-ups that involve significant swelling, and is not as effective for chronic joint issues.

, If your bunion has been a chronic problem for many months or years and it feels stiff more so than inflamed, then soaking it in a hot bath with Epsom salt may provide relief. The hot water will help improve circulation and the magnesium-rich salt works well to reduce ligament and tendon tension, joint stiffness and pain.Soak your entire foot for about 20 minutes and repeat on a daily basis to treat a chronic bunion. Taking a foot bath first thing in the morning prior to exercising or going to work is a great way for making the bunion more flexible and less symptomatic at the end of the day.


The salt in the bath also acts as an natural antiseptic, which is helpful for combating any infections related to blisters, minor cuts or ingrown toenails — all common sequel of bunions.
Try gently flexing your sore toe repeatedly while soaking your foot, as it will help increase circulation and joint mobility.
Essential oils that you can add to the Epsom salt bath to help ease symptoms include peppermint, eucalyptus or rosemary extracts.Arnica tincture is also helpful for acute joint and muscle pain.

, If your big toe(s) is looking crooked and creating discomfort, then consider applying a splint at night for structural support and leaving it on while you sleep. Taping a plastic or metal splint around the affected toe(s) might help reduce the pain and realign the joint, depending on how advanced the bunion is.A bunion splint is positioned in a longitudinal direction over the toe, which results in a corrective force being applied. However, splints are mainly for prevention and are not meant to completely reverse a bunion. Bunion splints can be found at most medical supply or rehabilitation-type stores, but consult with your physician or podiatrist before using one.


Rigid splints are usually considered night-time splints because the materials don't flex and cannot bear weight.
Silicone or felt pads worn on your feet or in your shoes during the day may also relieve bunion pain, but it depends on the degree of crookedness and joint damage.

, Osteopaths and chiropractors are joint specialists who focus on naturally establishing normal movement and function within spinal joints as well as peripheral joints, such as those in your toes.The crookedness of your bunion can sometimes be reduced with manual joint manipulation — also called an adjustment. An adjustment to your big toe can potentially reposition the misaligned joint and make the toe straighter. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with an adjustment, which is normal.


Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely realign a mild bunion, more than likely it will take several adjustments to treat most advanced bunions.
Although a toe adjustment doesn't always reduce the crookedness of a bunion, it can significantly reduce the pain and stiffness of a bunion, making the big toe more functional again.

, Podiatrist are foot specialists who can examine your toes and tell you whether you have a bunion or if you're at risk of developing one. Podiatrists usually treat bunions naturally (without drugs, injections or surgery) with splints, special taping techniques and/or custom made orthotics (shoe inserts). Custom orthotics and orthopedic shoes are beneficial because they support your arches, provide shock absorption, improve foot biomechanics and reduce the pressure on your big toes. Custom-made orthotics can be expensive without medical coverage, so check your policy, but cheaper off-the-shelf insoles may be beneficial also.


You may have to buy shoes a little bigger than you normally would in order to accommodate the custom-made orthotic insoles.
Some medical doctors, chiropractors and physical therapists also make orthotics, so shop around for the best price and service.

, Make an appointment with a qualified massage therapist and get a deep tissue foot massage that includes the toes and Achilles tendons. Massage reduces muscle tension, increases joint mobility and promotes better blood flow.Have the therapist start rubbing from the toes and work towards the calf muscles so you help the venous blood circulate. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate, especial around the base of the big toe, without wincing. Massage can treat the symptoms of bunions, but is unlikely to reverse the deformity of them.


Start by experimenting with three 30-minute foot massages spread out over the course of a week and see how it impacts your bunion symptoms.
Always drink lots of water following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture is an ancient healing technique / art that was developed primarily in China. It involves placing small needles into specific energy points within the skin in efforts to reduce pain and swelling and stimulate healing.Acupuncture treatment for bunions is not a commonly recommended treatment by mainstream medical professionals, although some anecdotal reports suggest it can be helpful for joint pain. As such, if you've tried other natural treatments without success, then acupuncture is worth experimenting with due to its great safety record and relative affordability.Acupuncture is now practiced by many mainstream health professionals, such as physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths and massage therapists. Regardless, whoever you pick should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.Acupuncture points that may provide relief for your bunions are not all located near the big toe where the pain is coming from — some points can be in distant areas of the body.
Japanese acupuncturists view bunions as a sequel of diabetes, or as a symptom of sugar imbalance in the body. They believe that excess sugar intake results in inflammation, which can promote bunions.

Rest your knee.,
Ice your knee.,
Apply a compress.,
Take over-the-counter painkillers.,
Go see your doctor.",How to Treat Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears1," Start by sitting down to take any weight off of your knee. Sit on a comfortable chair or lie down with your knee elevated above your waist on a pillow or another, higher chair. Elevating your knee will help the swelling to go down.Try not to move your knee at all or be up on your feet. Ask a friend or relative to help you reach for items and prepare any food so you do not have to stand or walk.;
, Wrap an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas in a towel. Place it on your knee every two hours for 20 minutes at a time. Doing this can help to reduce any pain or soreness and keep the swelling down.Do not leave the ice pack on for longer than 20 minutes at a time as too much cold can aggravate your knee joints.

, Take a compression band or an elastic bandage and wrap it around your knee. Wrap the compression band around your knee several times, protecting the joints in your knee. Make sure the compression band is snug but not cutting off circulation to your knee. You may need someone to assist you in wrapping your knee, depending on how severe the ACL tear is.

, If the pain is severe due to your torn ACL, take OTC painkillers as needed. Follow the dosage directions on the label and never take more than the recommended dose., Once you do immediate care of your knee and take painkillers, you should reach out to your doctor or get driven to the nearest medical center. The doctor will start with X-rays to evaluate the bone structure of the knee and then get an MRI to get a detailed view of the ligaments and tendons of the knee.This will help determine how severe the tear is on your ACL.Ask someone to drive you to the nearest medical center for a diagnosis. Do not try to stand, walk, or drive unassisted. Use crutches or have someone lift you if you need to walk or stand.

Be wary of lingering pain and inflammation.,
Look for signs of fracture.,
Look for signs of subungual hematoma (blood under the nail).,
Check for breaks in the nail.,
If the toe injury appears serious, see a doctor.",How to Treat a Stubbed Toe2," As noted in the introduction, most stubbed toes are not serious injuries. Thus, a good indication that your stubbed toe is something more serious is if it does not seem to get better right away. Pain that doesn't get better in the same amount of time as an ordinary bruise is often a sign of an underlying problem that requires special treatment. Specifically, be on the lookout for the following signs:Pain that doesn't lessen within an hour or two
Pain that fully returns whenever pressure is put on the toe
Swelling and/or inflammation that makes it difficult to walk or wear shoes for a few days
Bruise-like discoloration that doesn't go away within a few days

, Especially-bad stubbed toes often result in a fracture (a break in the toe's bone). In this case, it's usually necessary to receive an X-ray, cast, or foot brace. Signs of a fracture include:An audible ""crack"" or ""pop"" at the time of injury
A toe that visually appears ""bent,"" ""kinked,"" or ""crooked""
Being unable to move the injure toe
Prolonged pain, inflammation and bruising.
Note that many broken toes don't prevent the injured person from walking. Being able to walk isn't a sign that a toe isn't broken.

, Another injury that's common from a stubbed toe is for blood to gather under the toenail. The pressure between the built-up blood and the nail can lead to prolonged inflammation and swelling, making recovery a long, uncomfortable process. In this case, a doctor can make a small hole in the nail, allowing the blood to drain and relieving the pressure. This procedure is called a trephination., A toe injury that causes part or all of the nail to detach from the nail bed can be extremely painful. While treatment at home may be possible in some cases, seeing a doctor will give you access to treatments for reducing pain, protecting the wound, and fighting infection that may not be available to you otherwise.


In addition, if an injury is serious enough to break your nail, it is possible that it has also caused a fracture or another problem that requires a doctor's help.

, All of the problems mentioned above — toe fractures, hematomas, and nail breakages — are good reasons to see a doctor. A medical professional can use X-ray machines and other equipment to accurately diagnose your problem. In addition, doctors and nurses have the training necessary to instruct you how to protect your toe as it heals. Again, it's important to remember that most stubbed toes won't require medical attention. However, if you have reason to believe that yours is serious, don't be afraid to make an appointment.


Always follow your doctor's advice over advice you find online. If anything your doctor tells you contradicts something you've read in this article, listen to your doctor.

Buy insoles for your child’s shoes.,
Try R.I.C.E.,
Seek professional care if your child’s pain does not go away after several days.,
Get medicated ointment for athlete's foot.",How to Treat Foot Pain in Children2," If you think your child’s shoes are what are causing your child’s foot pain, consider buying padded insoles for your child’s shoes to make them more comfortable. The insoles will help to raise your child’s heels and can relieve basic foot pain like soreness or stiffness.If your child complains about foot pain when wearing the same pair of shoes, discard the pair of shoes and replace them with better fitting shoes. Make sure your child wears proper running shoes when playing sports or spending time outdoors so their feet are well supported during any strenuous activity.

, If your child is feel throbbing pain in his feet after a day of exercise, you may try R.I.C.E.: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. This will likely help to resolve any immediate pain for several hours or overnight. To practice R.I.C.E:Allow your child to rest their feet and legs by avoiding any physical or strenuous activity.
Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel, or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, to their feet by tucking it under their heels. Keep the ice on for 20 minute intervals, and wait 10 minutes between each interval before placing the ice back on their feet.
Wrap a compression bandage, such as an ACE bandage, around both of your child’s feet to keep the swelling down. The bandage should be snug but should not cut off the blood circulation to your child’s feet.
Elevate your child’s feet by placing them on a pillow or several blankets. This will help to reduce any pain or swelling.
Use an over-the-counter pain medication if needed. Pediatricians commonly recommend ibuprofen for temporary pain relief.

, If you try home treatments and your child’s foot pain persists, make an appointment with your family doctor. A pediatrician or orthopedist can often treat foot pain. In some cases you may be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon or a podiatrist.A podiatrist will help to identify the cause of your child’s foot pain and is specially trained to treat the growth plates, bones, and soft issues in a developing child’s feet.

, If your doctor diagnoses your child with athlete's foot, she may write a prescription for an anti fungal cream or powder. Your child will need to treat his feet with the anti fungal product for about four weeks, and continue to treat his feet with the product one week after the skin condition appears to go away so the fungus is fully removed.You should also switch your child's socks to absorbent socks that wick away moisture from his feet. This will prevent the growth of new fungi that can cause athlete's foot. He should avoid wearing shoes made out of non breathable material like vinyl, as this can lead to excess moisture on his feet and the potential growth of fungi."
"
Allow the podiatrist to examine your child’s feet.,
Discuss your child’s treatment options.,
Consider surgery if your child has severe flat footedness.",How to Treat Foot Pain in Children3," The podiatrist may ask your child to sit, stand, raise his toes while standing, and to stand on his tiptoes. He may also check your child’s heel cord (the Achilles tendon) for any tightness and also look to see if the bottom of your child’s foot has any calluses, warts, ingrown toenails, or wear and tear.The podiatrist may also ask you if anyone in your family is flat footed and if there is a history of neurological or muscular disease in your family.
The podiatrist may get x-rays of your child’s feet to get a closer look at the bone structure.

, Once the podiatrist has assessed your child’s feet, he will diagnose the cause of your child’s pain. If your child is flat footed, but it is not too severe, or if he is suffering from Sever's disease, or pediatric heel, the podiatrist may recommend non surgical options such as:Resting and avoiding activities that cause pain until the symptoms go away.
Over-the-counter pain medication and anti inflammatory medication.
Stretching exercises to extend the heel cords on both feet.Over-the-counter cushioned arch supports for your child’s shoes.
Custom made orthotics for your child’s shoes to balance out their feet and support any sensitive areas on their feet.
Physical therapy to strengthen any weak areas in your child’s feet.

, In some cases, a child’s flat footedness cannot be corrected with non surgical options and may require foot surgery. Your podiatrist will refer you to a foot surgeon who can then walk you through the surgical procedure.


Most foot surgeons recommend the child be at least eight years old to undergo surgery. The foot surgery for flat footedness will require the surgeon to lengthen your child’s Achilles tendon. The surgeon will also lengthen your child’s heel bone using a bone graft that is inserted on the outer side and edge of the middle of the foot in a procedure called calcaneal lengthening osteotomy."

Continue treatment.,
Let your feet breathe.,
Disinfect your shoes.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Wear cotton socks.,
Bleach your shower.,
Avoid sharing.",How to Treat and Prevent Athlete's Foot2," Fungi have a nasty habit of sticking around in our bodies long after they show up on our skin. Continue your chosen method(s) of treatment for 3-6 weeks total, even after all external signs of athlete's foot have disappeared. This will make sure that the fungus has truly left your system, and making a second round of the skin ailment much less likely.

, But not too much. The amount of exposure your feet require takes walking a thin line; too much, and you might contract the fungus again. Too little exposure, and moisture build up will, again, cause a second bout of athlete's foot. Try to wear sandals and shoes that allow your feet to breathe, but avoid walking barefoot. When you are walking in moist areas (such as at a pool or in the shower), wear flip-flops or other shoes that protect your feet from contacting the fungi-filled floors.

, Any shoes you wore during the period of time you suffered from athlete's foot are inevitably contaminated with the fungi. Purchase an antifungal powder that focuses on this particular problem, and sprinkle it in all your shoes on a weekly basis., Fungi grow best in moist areas, making sweaty feet a prime environment. Keep your feet dry at all times, using a towel to absorb excess moisture between your toes and on the soles of your feet after showering, sweating heavily, or swimming. Doing this on a regular basis will produce an environment inhospitable to the fungi that cause athlete's foot.

, Heavy socks that trap moisture are a no-go if you are a sufferer of athlete's foot. Make the transition to wearing only cotton socks that allow your feet to breath and are easily washed and bleached. Additionally, wash socks on a regular basis, and wear each pair for a single use only.

, You’ve cleaned your shoes, cleaned your socks, and the one place left accountable for possible fungus growth is your shower. Clean the floor of your shower with a wash-down of bleach on a weekly basis. Any sponges or brushes that you may use to clean your feet in the shower should be thrown out and replaced or properly disinfected.

, Anything that might contain foot related fungi or sweat should be avoided, unless its your own. Keep your own towels, shoes, and socks to yourself and avoid borrowing those items from others."

Get a physiotherapist.,
Make a physiotherapy plan.,
Use a knee brace.",How to Treat Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears2," If you want to avoid getting surgery done on your torn ACL, you can try doing physiotherapy on your knee. Progressive physical therapy and rehabilitation can be a good option for people who are only moderately active, older than 65, or willing to stop doing high impact sports. Physiotherapy is often recommended if you still have some stability in your knee and your ACL is only partially torn, not completely torn.Speak to your doctor about doing physiotherapy to treat your ACL tear. They can likely recommend a good physiotherapist that you can work with to improve your ACL and recover from this injury.

, Meet with the physiotherapist and come up with a plan to treat your injury. You will need to commit to a recovery program that can last at least six to 10 months and do exercises with your physiotherapist to strengthen your knee. The physiotherapist should keep you updated on your progress and let you know if your ACL tear is improving over time.If you are an active, athletic person, you may opt for surgery so your knee can be fully repaired and you can return to doing sports or other activities more quickly.
Some people who opt for physiotherapy over surgery can end up developing secondary knee injuries or a torn meniscus, which will require surgery to fix.

, Another rehabilitation option is to invest in a custom knee brace that you can wear when you stand or walk. The knee brace can help to protect and support your knee. You can also use the knee brace as part of your physiotherapy plan.Keep in mind that many people with ACL tears who use knee braces do not have a very large range of movement and are not able to do any strenuous activity while standing. You may not do well with a knee brace if you are an athlete or very active.

Speak to your doctor about surgery on your ACL.,
Discuss the procedure with the surgeon.,
Make a recovery plan.,
Schedule follow up appointments with your doctor.",How to Treat Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears3," Your doctor may recommend that you get surgery on your ACL if you are an athlete and want to continue playing sports, particularly if the sport involves jumping or pivoting. You may also need surgery if there is more than one ligament that is damaged in your knee or there is cartilage in your knee and your knee is buckling with everyday use.Your doctor will refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. You can then set up a consultation with the surgeon to go over the ACL surgery in more detail.

, During the reconstruction of your ACL, the surgeon will remove the damaged ligament and replace it with a segment of tendon, which is tissue that is similar to a ligament. The replacement, called a graft, will come from another part of your knee or from a deceased donor. A new ligament will then grow on the graft in your knee and over time, your ACL will be complete again.This is generally done in an arthroscopic surgery, which uses tools to perform the surgery through small openings along the sides of your knee. You will be put under general anesthesia during the surgery.
Depending on your procedure, you may need to spend the night in the hospital after the surgery.

, You should discuss your recovery plan with your surgeon so your ACL heals properly. It will take about four to six months for you to recover completely and return to normal activity. You will need to go to physiotherapy and do strengthening exercises on your knee to ensure your ACL heals correctly.You may also need to stay off your feet for a period of time after the surgery to give your knee a chance to recover.

, To ensure your ACL tear heals properly, set up follow up appointments every few months after your surgery with your doctor. Your doctor can then confirm your knee is recovering properly and you are on track to gaining back mobility of your knee.


Having follow up appointments will also allow your doctor to check if there are any issues remaining in your knee joints or your ACL, even after the surgery.

This is especially helpful if you believe your sore toe is due to injury or overexertion. Try and stay off your foot for a few days and see if you notice any improvement. Do not engage in strenuous exercise and avoid walking and jogging until your pain passes., Applying ice on a sore toe can help speed up healing time. You can make your own ice pack at home or buy an ice pack at a drug store.


If you buy an ice pack at the store, make sure you do not apply it directly to your skin. An ice pack should always be wrapped in a towel or rag before applying it to an injury.You can also place ice cubes in a plastic bag or use something like a bag of frozen vegetables., Over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen can help ease foot pain. Take any over-the-counter meds as directed on the package. Make sure you talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you're on any medication currently or have other medical problems. You want to make sure over-the-counter medication will not negatively interacting with any existing medications., While there is limited scientific evidence as to the benefits of Epsom salt soaks, many people find them soothing for foot pain. You can purchase Epsom salt at many drug stores. Fill a bath or basin with lukewarm water and then add a small handful of salt to the water. Soak your feet for 20 to 30 minutes and see if you notice any improvement., Elevation can help reduce soreness and swelling in sore feet and toes. Try elevating your foot slightly above your heart whenever possible. See if this improves your symptoms., A sore toe usually heels on its own within a few days and is not a cause for medical intervention. However, you should see a doctor if you have the following symptoms:


Severe pain or severe swelling
An open wound
Any signs of an infection, such redness, warmth, tenderness, or a fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or pus coming from a wound or the area that’s sore.
Are unable to walk
Are unable to put any weight on your foot, Toe pain can be caused by a variety of medical conditions. See if you have other symptoms that may point to some common causes of toe pain. An injury such as dropping something on your toe, kicking something with your toe, or stubbing your toe can cause acute toe pain. See your doctor if you have suffered an injury of your toe and have severe pain, swelling, or other severe symptoms.


Gout, a type of arthritis, can be a cause of toe pain. In addition to toe pain, you may notice redness, warmth, and tenderness near your toes.Blisters, corns, and callouses are common foot ailments that can sometimes cause toe pain. You will usually notice fluid-filled sacks, pimple-like marks, and hard, rough areas of yellowish skin. Blisters tend to heal naturally on their own while callouses and corns may require medical removal.Ingrown toenails are a common cause of foot pain. These occur when the sides of your toenails grow into the surrounding skin. The toenails pierce the skin, causing it to become red, swollen, or tender. You may also notice brown discoloration of the toenails., While many causes of toe pain are easily treatable, some conditions can be somewhat serious and difficult to treat. Evaluate whether you're at risk for any serious conditions related to toe pain and see a doctor to rule out such conditions.


Diabetes can cause tenderness in the feet and toes. Other symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urination, frequent hunger, and cuts and bruises that are slow to heel. If you're concerned you may have diabetes, your doctor can diagnosis you with a routine exam and blood test.Arthritis is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the joints. If you have arthritis, you will probably notice pain throughout your body in addition to your feet. You are more likely to have arthritis if you are a senior. If you're worried about arthritis, talk to your doctor., If your sore foot does not improve with at home treatments, see if your doctor can offer any treatment options based on your condition. Your doctor will perform an examination to determine the cause of your foot pain and recommend treatments from there.


If you have a broken toe, your doctor may use medical tape to secure the bones in place so they can heal. Usually, the injured toe is taped to the uninjured toe allowing that toe to act as a splint. Your doctor may also provide a cast or a stiff bottom shoe to promote heeling. In very rare cases, surgery is used to treat a sore toe.For the most part, over-the-counter medications are ideal for the treatment of a sore toe. However, if your pain does not improve with over-the-counter meds your doctor may recommend prescription medication based on the suspected cause of your condition, your medical history, and your existing medications., A podiatrist is a foot doctor who can give you another opinion about your toe, especially if the pain is lingering and becoming a chronic problem. The podiatrist will examine your foot and toes for trauma and look for any benign growths or tumors. Your regular physician will refer you to a podiatrist if he or she feels it is necessary., High heels and shoes that are too small or tight can cause soreness of the feet and toes. Make sure you select comfortable footwear that fits your feet. If you have a job that requires a lot of walking, opt for comfortable flat shoes over high heels or tight, pinchy dress shoes.

, If you are prone to foot soreness, consider purchasing shoe inserts. You can either ask a doctor for customized shoe inserts or purchase over-the-counter inserts at a local department store. Shoe inserts are flat, gel-like material inserted inside your shoe to help ward off discomfort than can lead to soreness down the road.

, As ingrown toenails can cause toe soreness, make sure you trim your toenails properly. Always cut your toenails flat across and avoid cutting into corners. This can cause ingrown toenails.

Corns also develop along the tops of the toes, most often located just above a joint in the toe.Corns are categorized as hard, soft, or periungual. A hard corn most commonly develops on the top of the toe and over a bone joint. A soft corn develops between the toes, usually between the fourth and fifth toes. A periungual corn is less common, and occurs along the edge of a nailbed.A core is not always present, but is usually found at the center of the corn. The core consists of thick and dense skin tissue.The core of the corn points inward and often presses on a bone or nerve which causes it to be quite painful.A callus does not have a core, and is a broader area that is made of evenly distributed thicker tissue. Calluses are not usually painful, although they can be uncomfortable.Calluses usually develop on the bottom of the foot and just beneath the toe area. Calluses can also develop on the hands, usually on the palm side and just under the fingers.Both corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure.;
, Salicylic acid is the most common ingredient found in over-the-counter products used to treat corns and calluses.The use of over-the-counter products is helpful in removing corns and calluses, but their use is more effective when combined with general measures to take care of the skin.Take steps to treat the immediate problem, but be sure to correct the problem causing the friction or pressure., Salicylic acid corn remover pads are available without prescription in strengths as strong as 40%.Soak the foot in warm water for about five minutes to soften the tissue. Dry the foot and toes thoroughly before applying the pads.Take care not to apply the pad against healthy skin tissue.Most products recommend repeating the procedure every 48 to 72 hours, for up to 14 days, or until the corn is removed.Salicylic acid is classed as a keratolytic agent. This means it helps to bring added moisture to the area while working to soften and dissolve skin tissue. Salicylic acid can be harmful to healthy tissue.Follow the instructions on the product or in the product literature. Do not use if you are allergic to salicylic acid products.Avoid getting salicylic acid products in your eyes, nose, or mouth, and do not use on any other area of the body without instructions from your doctor.Rinse any areas accidentally exposed to salicylic acid with water immediately.Keep salicylic acid products stored in a safe manner, away from children and pets.

, Salicylic acid comes in a variety of forms and a multitude of strengths. Foams, lotions, gels, and pads are available that can be used to treat callused areas on your foot.Each product has unique application instructions. Follow the direction on the product or in the product literature to effectively use salicylic acid products to get rid of calluses., Other than treatment with salicylic acid, other products are available over-the-counter that may be helpful.Products that contain 45% urea can be used topically as keratolytics to help soften and remove unwanted tissue, including corns and calluses.Follow the directions provided on the product label or contained in the product literature.Routine directions for using 45% topical urea products include twice daily applications until the condition has resolved.Do not ingest topical urea products, and do not get them in your eyes, nose, or mouth.Keep the products away from children and pets.If swallowed, call 911, call a poison control center, or seek emergency medical attention the fastest way possible., For callused areas, using a pumice stone or file designed for the foot, can help to get rid of the hardened areas of skin.This can also be used for unwanted calluses that form on the hands.Using a device like a pumice stone or file helps to remove layers of dead skin. Take care not to file away healthy tissue. Doing so can lead to further irritation and possibly infection if the healthy skin is broken.File away layers of thickened and hard tissue before you apply medication., Soaking your feet in warm water helps to soften the thickened areas of tissue for both corns and calluses.For unwanted calluses on your hands, soaking the area can help to soften the tissue just as it does for your feet.Dry your feet or hands thoroughly after soaking. While your skin tissue is soft after soaking, proceed with using your pumice stone or file..
Even if you don’t have time to soak your feet or hands every day, use the pumice stone or file just after getting out of your bath or shower., Apply moisturizers to your feet and hands to help keep the tissues soft.This can make it easier to remove the hardened thick areas of skin with a pumice stone or file, as well as help to prevent the formation of corns and calluses., If you have diabetes, you are at greater risk of serious foot problems partly caused by changes in circulation to your extremities.Medical conditions like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and any other condition that interferes with normal blood flow, warrant medical help to treat corns and calluses. Talk to your doctor before treating your corns or calluses at home., While corns and calluses rarely fall in the category of a medical emergency, sometimes the areas are very large and quite painful.Seeking help from your doctor is the safest and most effective way to proceed with treatment.Some corns and calluses are resistant to the available over-the-counter treatment options. Ask your doctor about prescription strength products or procedures that may be helpful.Your doctor can help by performing some in-office procedures to improve the condition.Using a scalpel or other tool available in the medical office, your doctor can help to trim away large areas of excess and hardened skin.Do not attempt to trim very thick areas of hardened skin at home. This may lead to more irritation, bleeding, and possible infection., In addition to corns and calluses, sometimes warts are part of the problem.Your doctor can help determine if warts, or any other skin condition, is involved and recommend the best treatment approach., Very rarely, the corns or calluses may become infected.See you doctor as soon as possible if any area of your foot or hand is red, swollen, feels warm to the touch, or is more tender than normal., Some people have deformities in their feet that cause them to have repeated problems, including recurrent problems with corns and calluses.Your doctor may refer you to a podiatrist for treatment. Some conditions that may be contributing to the problems you are having with corns and calluses include hammer toe, bone spurs, lower than normal natural arches, and bunions.Many of these conditions can be corrected by wearing inserts or specially designed footwear.In rare cases, surgery may be warranted., When calluses develop from a source of friction or pressure on your hands, it is possible for the skin to break and an infection can begin.In some cases, blisters form along with, just beneath, or beside the calluses. When this happens, fluid is contained inside the blisters, which is naturally absorbed back into the skin with time. If the blisters pop or drain, it is easy to get an infection started in the healthy tissue around the blisters and calluses.Contact your doctor if your hand appears reddened, swollen, or warm to the touch.Topical or systemic antibiotics may be needed if you have an infection., The most common cause of corns and calluses on the feet is something causing irritation, pressure, or friction in the same spot.By eliminating the source of the friction, you can prevent corns and calluses from forming., Shoes that do not fit can rub against your toes or cause your foot to slide inside the shoe.Be sure your toes have plenty of wiggle room inside your shoes.Corns develop along the tops and sides of your toes, and can be due to wearing shoes that do not give your toes enough room.Repeated rubbing or irritation caused by shoes that do not fit properly are a major cause of corns of calluses.Tightly fitting shoes and shoes with high heels that cause your fit to slide forward can cause corns and calluses to develop.Calluses develop when the bottom or side of the foot slides against a part of the shoe that is irritating, or slides inside of shoes that are too large., Going without socks can cause your feet to experience friction and pressure from your shoes.Always wear socks to prevent the friction and pressure. Especially in shoes that are designed to wear socks, such as athletic foot wear, heavy work shoes, and boots.Be sure your socks fit properly. Socks that are too tight can squeeze your toes causing unwanted pressure and friction. Loosely fitting socks can slide down on your foot while in the shoe and contribute to added friction and pressure on areas of your foot., Use pads placed on top of the areas where the corns develop, between your toes, or along areas where the calluses form.Using pads, sections lamb’s wool, or toe separators can help to reduce the friction and pressure along your toe or foot area where the corns and calluses are located., Calluses form on your hands at the areas of greatest friction.In many cases, calluses on the hand are welcomed. One example involves people that play musical instruments. Guitar players, for instance, appreciate the calluses that form on the tips of their fingers. This helps them to play their instrument without pain.Another example is athletes that lift weights. The calluses that form on their hands can help them to grasp and manipulate the bars used in weight lifting."

Protect your knee.,
Rest your knee.,
Ice your knee.,
Compress your knee.,
Elevate your sore knee.,
Apply heat after 72 hours.,
Take oral pain medication.,
Try topical anti-inflammatory creams.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Do exercises.,
Take physical therapy if needed.,
Slowly increase activity.,
Get surgery if necessary.",How to Treat a Knee Sprain," As soon as you injure your knee, you need to protect it from further harm. When the sprain happens, do not continue to move your knee or perform the activity you were taking part in when you injured it. This will only cause your sprain to get worse. If at all possible, sit down immediately and take pressure off of your knee.


If you are in a public place, have someone help you get to the doctor. You don't need to walk too much on your knee until you assess how bad your sprain is.
See a doctor as soon as possible. Because it is the most popular method of treating a sprain, your doctor will likely tell you to follow the rest of the P.R.I.C.E. method after your visit. However, if it is a serious sprain, make sure you follow her instruction completely.;
, Within the first 48 hours, the most important thing for you to do for your knee is rest it. This will give the ligament time to heal and repair itself. Your doctor will likely tell you to stay off of it as much as possible in the days after your injury. To accomplish this, she may give you crutches to use.


Your doctor may also recommend a splint or a brace if you have issues keeping your knee still in the first few days after your injury., In the first few days, you should ice your knee to help relieve inflammation and pain. Put ice cubes or crushed ice in a sealed plastic bag or take a bag of frozen veggies from the freezer. Wrap the bag in a towel or cloth. Place the ice pack on your knee for 20 minutes at a time. You can repeat four to eight times a day.


Do not ice your leg for more than 20 minutes at a time. You could cause cold injury or frostbite if you do.
You can also use a cold compress instead of ice.You should continue treating your knee with ice for 48 hours or until the swelling goes down., To help reduce swelling, you should compress you knee in the days after your injury. You need to wrap your knee with an elastic bandage or band. Wrap the bandage tightly enough to support your knee and keep it from moving. However, make sure you do not wrap it so tight that it cuts off your circulation.


Take off the bandage while you sleep. This gives the blood in your knee time to circulate freely and your knee will not likely move much while you sleep.
You may be able to take the compress off after 48 hours. If you knee is still swollen, however, your doctor may advise you to keep compressing it., During the days after your injury, you should elevate your leg as much as possible. Try to keep your knee above the level of your heart to decrease the blood flow and swelling to your knee.Sit back or lie down on your back. Place two or three pillows underneath your sprained knee to elevate it above your heart.The amount you need to elevate your knee will depend on your environment. If you are sitting up, you may need more pillows than when you are laying down.

, After you have taken care of your leg with the P.R.I.C.E. method for 48 – 72 hours, you can begin to incorporate a few additional treatments that will help your knee pain and swelling get better. Use a heating pad or hot compress on your knee to alleviate stiffness and pain. Apply heat for 20 minutes, four times per day or as needed. This will help loosen up the muscles in your knee that you have been resting for the three days prior to heating it.


You can also apply heat to your knee in a sauna, whirlpool, hot bath, or hot tub.Do not heat before 72 hours have passed. You will actually do more harm than good if you heat too soon. The increased blood flow in your knee while it is still initially healing can cause it to bleed or swell more., While you are healing, over the counter pain medication can help you manage the pain involved. You can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain if you experience any that is too much for you to handle without drugs.


Try common brands of ibuprofen such as Advil and Motrin and brands of acetaminophen such as Tylenol.You can also take anti-inflammatory medications such as naproxen. You can buy it over the counter in such brands as Aleve.Ask your doctor for prescription anti-inflammatory medication, if the pain and swelling in your knee lingers longer than a week.

, If you don't want to take oral pain relievers, there are some topical creams that can help with the pain. You can buy creams with ibuprofen from your pharmacy. This method is best used when you have less pain because the topical version of ibuprofen does not get as much of the drug into your system, so it may not work on intense pain.


There are other creams that are available by prescription only. Ask your doctor if you think it might be an option you'd like to try., While you are recovering, you should not drink any alcoholic drinks. This is especially true in the first few days after you get injured. Alcohol can decrease the healing capabilities of your body. It can also encourage inflammation and swelling.


Ask your doctor before you start drinking alcohol again. You want to make sure your knee has healed enough that you won't deter your recuperation., Once you have healed enough to start moving your knee again, your doctor may give you exercises to help you get mobility back in your knee. The exercises will be aimed to help prevent stiffness, increase strength, improve range of motion, and increase the flexibility of the joints of your knee. You may be given exercises that focus on balance and strength. You need to do them several times a day to improve over time.


The type of the exercises and the amount of time you will have to do them depends on the extent of your injury. You may need more if your severely sprained your knee. Ask you doctor how long you should do your exercises., If your injury was really bad, you may need to work with a physical therapist or do at home physical therapy for a little while after your injury. This is not common in most cases, but there are some cases where this is necessary to completely heal the knee ligaments and return your knee to its former state.


The exercises you do will depend on you injury, but they are to help with stiffness, reduce any lingering swelling, and return your knee to its full range of motion without pain., A few weeks after your injury, your doctor may suggest you return to your normal everyday routine without the assistance of wraps, crutches, or braces. When this happens, it is likely that she will suggest you take it easy at first to test out your strength, flexibility, and range of motion after your injury.


If you do not experience pain, you can go back to your normal level of activity, including sports and other physical activities., In rare cases, your doctor may decide it is necessary that you have surgery. One of the main reasons for surgery is to repair your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is the ligament inside your knee that helps is move it back and forth. Since it is such an integral ligament, if you rupture, tear, or injure this muscle, it needs to get fixed in the best way possible. It is even more common for athletes to need surgery on the ACL to ensure a return to previous range of motion and strength.


You may also need surgery if you injured more than one ligament in your knee. It may be too difficult for your ligaments to repair themselves on their own.
Surgery is typically the last resort. In most cases, all the other methods are tried first before surgery is even considered as an option."

Recognize the symptoms of a stress fracture in your foot.,
Stop exercising, running or whatever you were doing at the onset of the pain.,
Take a load off.,
Grab the acetaminophen.,
See your personal physician.,
Get some rest.,
Prepare yourself for boredom from lack of exercise for 6-12 weeks.,
Go slow to get back into your normal routine, even if your foot feels better.,
Limited weight bearing exercise such as swimming or a stationary bike is acceptable.,
Know if you are particularly susceptible to stress fractures.,
Be careful when you exercise.,
Understand other debilitating factors.",How to Treat a Foot Stress Fracture," They normally start out as a slight discomfort towards the front of the foot. Most stress fractures of the foot start up here where most of the force and pressure is exerted. Many times, this pain is very slight and the onset is only during long periods of exercise, running or working out. As soon as you stop your activity, the pain normally vanishes. This leads many people to disregard and not even consider a stress fracture.;
, If it goes away, suspect a possible fracture. Resume your workout, and if it comes back, it very well could be.

, Get off your feet, sit down and get them elevated. Use an ice pack for swelling, but for no more than 20 minutes. Repeat as needed for 3-4 times per day.

, Avoid Naproxen and Ibuprofen containing products, as they have the potential to delay the healing process with bone injuries.

, As soon as the pain and swelling have subsided, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She will likely order some X-rays of your foot to confirm your self-diagnosis. You will likely be prescribed a walking boot or crutches, whichever you prefer; use them.

, Continue to follow your doctor's advice about wearing the boot or using the crutches. It is imperative for proper healing to keep weight and force off the injured foot. Keep your feet up as much as possible and make sure to get adequate sleep. Most healing takes place when you are sleeping and there is extra energy from the lack of use of other body functions.

, Healing a foot stress fracture is not a quick process by any means. It is one of the longer recovery periods because we have to use our feet at some point. The longer you can stay off your feet and let it heal, the quicker the healing will take. Don't even think about running or playing ball or exercising until it is completely healed.

, You will need to schedule a follow-up visit with your doctor. He may want to X-ray your foot once more to confirm it has fully healed. Even as such, you should really ease back into your normal program so as to not re-injure your foot.

, You may also work all your upper body muscles while waiting for the fracture to heal.

, If you are an athlete, a dancer, or in the military, you face an increased likelihood of getting a stress fracture.Be on the lookout if you've had a stress fracture before. This is because stress fractures tend to recur. About 60% of people who have a stress fracture have also had one previously., Stress fractures are a common occurrence for people with intense workouts. Doctors therefore recommend never increasing the intensity of your workout by more than 10% per week.Warm up and stretch thoroughly before you exercise.
Take frequent breaks to give your body and bones a break. If you feel uncomfortable or experience pain during exercise, stop immediately.
using good exercise equipment can help prevent stress fractures. Stress fractures may occur when your equipment forces you to adopt improper technique.

, High-impact sports can increase the likelihood of stress fractures, as can worn-out shoes or insufficient arch support."
"
Remove your shoes and socks, if necessary.,
Raise the affected leg above your waist.,
Ice the toe for 10 – 20 minutes.,
Take pain medication.,
Tape the pinky toe to its neighbor.,
Avoid wearing shoes or only wear open-toed shoes.,
Start walking again once your toe begins to heal.,
See your doctor if the break appears severe and is very painful.,
Let your doctor exam in your toe.,
Discuss surgery on the toe if the break is severe.,
Get antibiotics, if necessary.",How to Treat a Broken Pinky Toe," Treating your broken toe within the first 24 hours of the injury is crucial to ensuring it does not get infected or become too swollen. Take off any constricting items on your toes, such as socks or shoes.Once your toe is exposed, examine it to ensure no bones have broken through your skin. You should look closely to make sure your toe is still pointing in the right direction, despite the break, and does not appear blueish or feel numb to the touch. These are all indications that it is safe to treat the toe at home.;
, Sit down on a comfortable, stable surface. Place your foot on a stack of pillows or on a chair. Raise the leg to above your waist to reduce the swelling on your pinky toe.Raising the affected leg will also help to reduce the pain of the broken pinky toe.
You should try to keep your foot elevated as much as possible, even after the first 24 hours. Rest and elevation will help your pinky toe to heal. If your feet get cold, use a light blanket over your feet like a tent so there is very little pressure on your broken toe.

, For the first 24 hours of the injury, you should ice your toe to reduce swelling and pain. Wrap an ice pack in a towel and apply it to the toe for 20 minutes once an hour.You can also wrap a bag of frozen peas or corn in a towel and use it as an ice pack.
Do not leave the ice pack on for longer than 20 minutes at a time and never apply ice directly to your skin as this can lead to further injury.

, Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) for pain relief. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.Children under the age of 18 should not be given aspirin.
Do not take pain medication if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or any bleeding disorders, such as ulcers.

, After 24 hours, the swelling should start to go down if you properly elevate and ice the toe. You can then buddy tape your broken pinky toe to its neighboring toe to help stabilize it.Place a cotton ball between your pinky toe and the toe next to it. Wrap the pinky toe with medical tape and then wrap the pinky toe to the neighboring toe. Make sure the tape is snug around your toes but is not cutting off blood circulation to your toes. It just needs to be tight enough to provide some support to the broken toe.
You should change the cotton ball once a day and re-wrap the toes together so the area stays clean and stable.

, Do this until the swelling goes down and your toe starts to heal. Once the swelling is gone, you should wear shoes with a solid, comfortable sole to protect your toe., If you can wear shoes comfortably without irritating your broken toe, it may okay to start walking around on it. Go easy and only walk for short periods of time, as you do not want to put too much pressure or stress on your healing toe. Your toe may feel sore or stiff when you walk but this should go away once your toe starts to stretch out and get stronger.After walking around, you should check the toe for any swelling. If it appears swollen or irritated, ice it for 20 minutes every hour and elevate it.
Most broken toes will heal with the proper care within four to eight weeks.

, You should see a doctor right away if your toe is numb for a prolonged period of time or tingles continuously. You should also see a doctor if the bone appears to be broken at an angle and there is an open wound on your toe or any bleeding.You should also seek medical care if your toe does not heal properly within one to two weeks and is still very swollen and painful.

, Your doctor will likely request an X-ray of your broken toe to confirm the break. She may then numb your toe with a local anaesthetic and realign the bone through the skin.If there is any blood trapped under the toenail of the broken toe, your doctor may drain the blood by making a small hole in your nail or by removing the nail.

, Depending on the severity of the break, you may require surgery on the toe. Special pins or screws will be inserted into the broken bone to keep it in place while it heals.You may also need to support the toe in a cast. You may be given crutches so you can walk without putting any weight on the toe and to allow it to heal properly.

, If bone has pierced through the skin (this is known as an open fracture), there is a serious risk of infection. You will need to clean the wound regularly and you may be prescribed antibiotics to prevent infection.If your vaccinations are not up to date, your doctor may give you a tetanus shot to further prevent infection.

Add strength training sessions.",How to Tape Shin Splints," You can purchase either trainer’s tape or kinesiology tape to help relieve your shin splints. Tape will limit your range of motion and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area.You can get trainer’s and kinesiology tape at most pharmacies and sports stores, and even some larger retailers.
Some professionals suggest black tape, which may adhere better to sweaty skin.Though duct tape may work in a pinch, as it is as supportive as trainer's tape,duct tape was not meant to be used on skin, and therefore the adhesive is much stronger. If you tape your legs with duct tape, you risk blistering and shearing of the skin.;
, Clean any oils, sweat or dirt off your skin with a mild cleanser and some water. Make sure to dry it thoroughly with a towel. Washing and drying your leg can help ensure that the tape adheres effectively to your skin.You can use any kind of mild or simple soap to clean your leg.

, If you don’t want to use an underwrap or are especially hairy, consider shaving your leg(s). Shaving can help the tape adhere better. It can also be less painful to remove the tape from your leg.Make sure to shave carefully so that you don’t cut your skin and cause further injury., If you prefer not to place the tape against your skin, consider placing an underwrap between the tape and your skin. Be aware that using underwraps is not as effective as using tape only.Underwrap and skin adhesives are optional.Simply apply the skin adhesive and the underwrap to the areas of your skin you plan to tape.You can get underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies and possibly some sports stores., Depending on whether you purchase trainer’s or kinesiology tape or strips, you’ll need to cut the tape before you wrap your shin. This can help ensure you use the right amount of tape to effectively treat your shin splints and will keep you from wasting.Cut pieces of your tape to a length of 12–18 inches (45.7 cm) depending on how tall you are. If you are smaller, use less tape, and if you are taller, use more.Round the edges of the tape for easier application.Remove any backing from the tape before you wrap your shin., Flexing your foot can help the tape stay on your skin more effectively. Once you’ve done this, place one end of your tape on the top of your foot just below your pinky toe.Flex your foot to a 45 degree angle., From the top of your foot by your pinky toe, wrap the tape under your foot and then across your arch at the highest point, angling the tape upwards towards your skin.The tape should be taught but not tight. You don’t want to cut off your circulation.If your skin gets very red or starts to throb, you may have wrapped it too tightly., Wrap the tape in a diagonal fashion upwards across the front of the leg. You can tape your entire shin or just the areas affected with shin splints.Tape around the leg two more times, overlapping each previous band of tape slightly. The tape should cross over the part of your shin that is in pain.Do not wrap your calf muscle., Walk around before exercising. If the tape is too tight, remove it and repeat the taping process, wrapping the tape more loosely in the same fashion.

, In addition to basic shin taping, you can try a couple of other different taping methods. These may be more effective than basic taping for your shin splints.Wrap using the “X” arch taping method by holding your foot at a 90-degree angle with your toes curled slightly downward.Use one strip of tape around the ball of your foot as an anchor. Place additional strips of tape at the base of each toe and extend them up your shin. You can opt to put tape strips around the arch of your foot for added support.Wrap using the “lateral taping” method by starting tape at the front area of the ankle and continuing to wrap it around the back. Then wrap the tape up the outer calf and shin area at a 45-degree angle. Repeat this process four times for a support., After you’re leg begins to feel better or once you’re done exercising, take the tape off of your shin and foot. This can help your skin breathe and keep it from getting infected.


If you chose to not shave your legs before taping, you may experience some discomfort.

, Give you body a chance to rest or switch to lighter activities. Immobility and/or doing lower-impact activities can help heal your shin splints.If you do high-impact activities such as running or tennis, switch to lower-impact options. You can try biking, walking, or swimming to stay active while giving your legs a rest.You may also want to rest your legs completely for a while.Begin gently moving the affected area if you take a few days of full rest to help prevent stiffness unless it causes too much pain., Use an ice pack on the painful area of your shin. This can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time.You can take a slush bath by mixing ice and water in a bathtub. Soak your legs for up to 20 minutes.You can freeze a plastic foam cup full of water to gently massage the affected area.If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack., Consume pain relievers for severe discomfort and/or as necessary. These medications may help alleviate pain and possible swelling.Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium may also help alleviate some of the swelling.Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 18 without a doctor's permission, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

, If home treatment and other options don’t relieve your shin splints, see your doctor. Shin splints are very common and very treatable, and getting a medical diagnosis can help you get proper treatment.You can see your regular doctor or visit an orthopedist, who specializes in treating disorders such as shin splints.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of shin splints and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as what type of activities you do and what type of shoes you wear., Choose footwear that is appropriate for your sport and activity level. This can help ensure that your foot and legs have proper support and cushioning. It may also help prevent shin splints.For example, if you run on roads, get shoes with ample cushion. In addition, replace your shoes about every 350 to 500 miles (560 to 800 kilometers).Most sports stores and specialty stores can help you find the right shoes for your activity.

, Think about wearing supports in your shoes. Arch supports can help prevent the pain of shin splints, especially if you have flat arches.You can get arch supports at many pharmacies and most sports stores.

, Try cross-training with lower impact sports, such as swimming, walking or biking. This can help relieve shin splints while staying active and may help prevent future bouts of them.Be sure to begin new activities slowly and increase them gradually., Shin splints may occur when your shin and/or calf muscles are weak. Add some strength training exercises to help strengthen your calf muscles. This may also help prevent getting shin splints in the future.Toe raises may help strengthen your calves and prevent shin splints. Stand up and slowly rise up on your toes. Hold for two seconds and then slowly lower back to the ground. Repeat 10 times or as many times as you can.As you get stronger, you can add weights to toe raises.Leg presses and leg extension may also help with shin splints."

Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Your hips, knees, and ankles should all be in alignment.Inhale as you unlock your hips, pushing them back behind you. As you push back, your knees should begin to bend. Your back should be neutral — do not round your spine.Bend as deeply as you (comfortably) can. Keeping your back straight, keep pushing your butt out as you lower. Do not allow your knees to pass over your toes — keep your weight in your heels, do not lift them off the ground. If you can, let your hips sink below your knees. If you can't go that far, that's fine.Rise back to the starting position and repeat.
Start out doing eight to 10 squats, increasing the number as you begin to master the movements.;
, Lunges are another fundamental leg exercise that can be enhanced with the addition of weights. Once you've got the movements down, you can find tons of modifications to keep this exercise interesting.

Stand straight, feet together. Your shoulders should be back, your gaze straight ahead.With your core engaged, step forward with one leg. Lower your hips until both knees are bent at 90 degrees. Your front knee should not extend over your toe, and your back knee should not touch the ground. As with squats, your feet should be flat on the ground, weight concentrated in your heels.Push yourself back to the starting position and lunge with the opposite leg.Do eight to 10 lunges for each leg.

, The tree pose will strengthen your hamstrings and improve your balance. Because you will have to concentrate to maintain your balance, the tree pose serves to focus your mind.Stand with one foot flat on the floor. Bring your the bottom of your other food to rest on your inner thigh above the knee — never rest it on your knee. Squeeze your thigh against your knee to stabilize this position.
If you have trouble with the pose, modify it by placing your foot lower down on your straight leg. You can also stand near a wall if balance is a concern.

, The single leg kick will strengthen your glutes and your hamstrings.For maximum benefit, keep your torso still while performing the exercise.

Lie flat on your stomach with legs straight behind you. Prop yourself up on your arms making sure your elbows are underneath your shoulders.
Kick one heel in towards your buttocks. Then slowly straighten your leg back down towards the mat. Do a few repetitions and then switch legs.
Concentrating on moving only your lower legs will help to isolate your hamstrings and to deepen the muscle contraction. Pointing your toes will also help to isolate the hamstrings.

, Jump squats are a plyometric exercise (or activity that only uses body weight) that will isolate the quads.Start the exercise standing with feet hip width apart. Squat down, pressing your butt outwards, as if you were sitting down in a chair.
Jump straight up as high as possible. When you get touch down, immediately jump up again. Do eight to 10 jumps in a row.
Make sure to focus on good posture during the jump. The shoulders should never extend outward beyond the knees because the extension will put unnecessary strain on your back. Concentrate on using your whole foot during the jump instead of on just leaping from your toes.

, In addition to strengthening your outer and inner thighs, the eagle pose will help to improve balance.Stand straight up with feet hip width apart. Balancing on one leg, bring your other leg up and cross it over your standing leg.
Hook the top of your foot around the back of your knee and calf area. Squat down and hold the position for as long as possible. Try holding the pose for 20 to 30 seconds per leg and then gradually increasing to two to three minutes per leg.
Repeat on the other side. Do this position as long as possible for one set.

, This exercise requires no equipment and specifically targets your outer thighs or abductors.Begin this exercise by lying down on an exercise mat. Lay down on your side so both shoulders and hips are stacked on top of each other.
The arm that's closest to the floor should be extended above your head. The other arm should be bent at a 90 degree angle and place your hand on your hip.
Lift the top leg up towards the ceiling while keeping your leg straight and foot flexed. Repeat eight to 10 times and then switch sides.

, This exercise also requires no weights as it's considered a plyometric calf exercise.Find a box at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) off the ground. Stand on the box with your heels hanging off the edge.
Push up through your heels until you are standing on your tip toes and your calves are fully flexed. Hold this position for a brief moment.
Slowly lower your heels back down slightly past the level of the top of the box. Immediately press back up to return to being on your toes. Repeat eight to 10 times.

, This exercise is typically done on a weight machine and specifically targets the back of your legs or hamstrings.Adjust the machine to your height and desired weight resistance.
Point your toes straight down towards the floor with the machine pad behind your calves.
Curl your legs up as far as possible but do not lift your upper legs. Once your legs are fully contracted, hold this position for a brief second.
Slowly lower your legs back down to the start position. Repeat eight to 10 times per set.

, A depth jump is a plyometric exercise, which means that it increases the explosive power of the muscles.It specifically works the quads and even the glutes.

For this exercise find two sturdy boxes or benches. They should be about 12 to 16 inches (30 to 41 cm) high for one and the other 22 to 26 inches high.
Stand on one of the two boxes with feet together but slightly hanging off the edge of the box. Place the other box two or three feet in front of you.
Jump off the first box. The second you land, explosively jump up and out to the land on the box in front of you. Repeat eight to 10 times.
To make the exercise more challenging, jump from a low bench to the floor and then upward onto a taller bench. You can also use plyometrics boxes or stacked mats in place of benches.

, This exercise combines the use of a weighted barbell with a lunge. This targets and strengthens your quadriceps.Set up a barbell with an amount of weight that's appropriate for your fitness level. Place the bar slightly below your neck on your shoulders.
Carefully step one leg in front and lower your your back until it's bent in about a 90 degree angle. Front knee should be directly over the foot and ankle. Both knees should be bent in a 90 degree angle.
Use you the heel of your foot to push yourself up to the starting position. Repeat eight to 10 times per side.

, This weight machine targets your inner thighs or adductors specifically.Set the machine to fit your height and weight resistance. Sit on the machine with the pads touching your inner thighs and feet resting on the props.
Squeeze your legs together focusing on using your inner thigh muscles to bring your legs together.
Once your legs are together, hold that position for a brief second and then slowly release until the starting position. Do eight to 10 repetitions.

, This is a similar exercise to the standing calf raise, but works a different part of your calf muscles.Sit on an exercise bench with your feet flat on the floor about shoulder width apart.
While keeping your knees bent, push up through your heels until your calves are flexed and the ball of your feet is the only remaining part of your foot on the floor.
Hold this position for a brief second and then slowly lower back down until your feet are flat on the floor. Repeat eight to 10 times.

, If you need additional weight to make your calf exercises more difficult, consider using a calf raise machine.

Set the machine to your height and desired weight resistance.
Using the same motion as a standing calf raise, push up through your heels until you are standing on your tip toes.
If you're using a weighted machine you should feel moderate intensity resistance.
Repeat eight to 10 times or as needed.

, Running is a great cardio exercise that also helps sculpt and tone all parts of your legs.Start running or jogging at a pace appropriate for your fitness level. As you continue to run, you can increase your pace. Make sure to start off with dynamic stretches or warming up.
Running on an incline or running hills, can help strengthen your calf muscles more specifically.
It's typically recommended to run for at least 20 minutes per session,but run for as long as feels comfortable.

, Get on the stair master machine or hit the stairs at your gym or home. This exercise tones your butt and thighs significantly.The act of going up the stairs targets your quads and hamstrings in addition to burning a high level of calories.
This exercise also helps build endurance in your leg muscles which will make other forms of cardio and weight lifting easier.

, Bikers and cyclists are known for their great legs. Cycling is a great exercise to tone your entire leg.Each movement of pedaling targets the entire front and back of your leg. Push down hard on the pedals and pull back hard for a more intense workout.
If you don't have a bike or have a safe place to bike, considering going to the gym for a spin class.

Look at the soles of your shoes.,
Determine the space underneath your feet.,
Wet your feet and walk on cardboard.,
Look in the mirror at your posture.",How to Tell if You Pronate1," During normal walking (gait), your heel strikes the ground slightly on its outside or lateral edge, which is why the soles of your shoes should be noticeably more worn in that location.If the soles of your shoes appear to be worn directly in the middle of the heel area — or worse, on the inside or medial (middle) edge of the posterior sole — then you likely pronate too much while walking.


Wear patterns are likely easiest to notice on old running shoes with rubber soles because they wear down quicker.
Keep in mind that wear patterns on the extreme outside (lateral) edge of the posterior sole may indicate a complete lack of normal pronation and too much rigidity in the ankle and/or arch of the foot, which is termed over-supination.People who over-pronate tend not to be exceptionally fast runners because their ankles and feet collapse and don't transmit propulsion force up the leg.;
, While standing (weight bearing), there should be enough space underneath the inside part of your feet to insert a finger without too much force or discomfort. Thus, ask your partner or friend to help out by trying to stick their forefinger underneath your medial (inside) arches while you stand on firm flooring. If they can do it without difficulty or causing you discomfort, then you likely have normal arches and don't over-pronate (at least while standing). On the other hand, if there's not any space to slide a finger underneath readily, then you likely have flat feet, which is a major indicator and may cause or be caused by over-pronation.It's best to do this type of test in bare feet and while standing on a firm floor, such as wood, tile or linoleum.
Having normal looking arches while standing is not always a guarantee of normal amounts of pronation while walking. An overly rigid arch may not collapse, despite the ankle joint rolling in and over-pronating during walking and running, but that's fairly rare.
Likewise, having somewhat flat arches when standing still doesn't necessarily mean you over-pronate.

, A good objective test to see whether or not you over-pronate and/or have flat feet is the ""wet feet"" test.Dampen the bottoms of your feet with water and walk across some cardboard, thick paper or any surface that clearly shows your wet footprint. Make sure to get prints of both feet and look at them closely. A foot with a healthy arch and normal amount of pronation will leave a print of the heel, connected to the front forefoot by a strip about 1/2 the width of the foot on the outside of the sole.If you over-pronate, your entire foot will be visualized on the print because the entire underside of your foot contacted the ground while walking, which is abnormal.


The way your arch appears on this wet test is a good indication of how your foot pronates, but not a guarantee of over-pronation, because some people with flat feet don't necessarily over-pronate when they walk.
Typically, both feet leave the same kind of footprint, but in some cases differences are noticed due to previous foot / ankle injuries or leg length differences.

, Another indicator of how your ankles and feet are working while weight bearing and walking is to look at your posture (below your waist mainly) while standing in front of a full-length mirror. Change into some shorts and look at your legs, knees and ankles. In general, people with knees that are very close together or touch while standing (called knock knees or genu valgum) are often over-pronators with flat feet because more pressure is placed on the medial part of the foot.As well, look at the thick Achilles tendon that attaches your heel to your calf muscles. It should be straight, but in over-pronators it's almost always crooked and deviates laterally.Over-pronation is sometimes related to genetics that dictate the development of the ankle and foot, but often it's caused by obesity. Over-weight people may have Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction (PTTD). The arch of the foot is, in large part, held up by this tendon, which can wear out when placed under too much force.
Your legs should be fairly straight, with at least a few inches between your knees, as you look into a mirror at your posture. People who are ""bow-legged"" (medically referred to as genu varus), often walk more on the outsides of their feet and tend to over-supinate.

See your family doctor.,
Consult with a podiatrist.,
Get a referral to an orthopedic surgeon.",How to Tell if You Pronate2," If you think you pronate too much and believe it's causing pain or other symptoms in your feet, ankles, knees or low back then make an appointment with your physician. Although your doctor is not a foot specialist, she should be familiar enough with normal anatomy and physiology that she can detect abnormalities and make helpful recommendations. She can also better assess what's causing your symptoms. For example, foot, ankle and/or knee pain is often caused by osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type), repetitive trauma, circulatory problems, lack of exercise and obesity, and may have nothing to do with your degree of foot pronation.Your doctor may take foot x-rays, which is great for seeing bone alignment (a collapsing ankle joint can be detected, for example), but not great for seeing the integrity of the ligaments and tendons that form the foot's arch.
Your doctor may recommend that you lose weight by changing your diet, which may relieve your symptoms and reduce the degree to which you pronate.
If you're pregnant, your doctor may tell you to be patient because the hormones released during pregnancy make ligaments more lax, which can lead to temporary flat feet and over-pronation. Occasionally this can become a permanent condition — if symptoms persist for more that six months postpartum, you should be re-evaluated.

, A podiatrist is a foot specialist who is more familiar with the normal biomechanics of the feet and the various conditions and diseases that cause abnormal gait (walking and running), including over-pronation and flat feet. A podiatrist will examine your feet, including your arches and ankles, and determine if your degree of pronation is normal or abnormal. A computerized gait analysis is often used by podiatrists to better understand how you walk and to what degree you pronate. The analysis typically involves walking over a sensitive force plate that's connected to a computer. Some doctors may also use thermography (heat sensitive pads) to better understand the biomechanics of your feet while walking.


Conditions related to chronic over-pronation include plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, bunions, Achilles tendinitis and shin splints.To correct over-pronation, podiatrists usually recommend custom made orthotics (shoe inserts with strong arch support) or orthopedic shoes that help prevent the ankle from rolling in excessively.
Podiatrists are trained for relatively minor foot operations, but more complex or involved surgical procedures are usually done by orthopedic surgeons.

, If you think you over-pronate (with or without flat feet) and are not getting adequate relief from conservative approaches such as orthotics, supportive shoes and weight loss, then ask your family physician for a referral to an orthopedic surgeon (musculoskeletal surgeon) who specializes in the foot. The orthopedic surgeon may use a CT scan, MRI or diagnostic ultrasound to visualize the soft tissues of your foot to confirm if you pronate too much and then determine the likely causes. This doctor can tell you if you pronate, and present all your options for treatment, which may include corrective surgery. Your doctor will likely not suggest surgery until all other possibilities have been exhausted.


Some causes of pronation, such as tarsal coalition (an abnormal fusion of two or more bones around the ankle), are only correctable with surgery.Surgery may also be required to lengthen an overly tight Achilles tendon or to repair an overly lax posterior tibial tendon (the main tendon of the foot's arch) — both causes of over-pronation.
Recovery times for surgery vary depending on the procedure (whether bones need to be broken or fused, tendons severed, or ligaments altered), but can last several months.

Familiarize yourself with the risk factors.",How to Tape a High Ankle Sprain," Wash the foot in warm water and soap and pat it dry before proceeding to step 2. Dirty or moist feet can invite fungi to grow and cause athlete’s foot.;
, You can do this by keeping the toes pointing straight toward the ceiling. The feet have a natural tendency to point downward in a long-sitting position. Keeping the foot in a neutral position helps to prevent excessive stress on the ankle joint.

, Use pre-wrap tape to cover the skin from the mid foot to 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the ankle. A pre-wrap protects the skin from irritation or abrasion caused by athletic tape.


Starting at the mid-foot, wrap the pre-wrap around the foot, around the ankle and heel and up the leg until you reach a spot three inches above the ankle. Each strip of pre-wrap should overlap the previous strip by half.
Don't worry if you miss a patch of skin around the heel as you wrap, this is not likely to cause any problems. Keep the pre-wrap tight, and try to use as little as possible.

, Take the athletic tape and wrap it around the top edge of the pre-wrap (just under the calf muscle) three times, moving downwards. This forms the anchor and helps to keep the tape in place during movements.


Make sure that each layer of tape covers 50% of the previous layer. This helps to keep the anchor stable.
The tape should be snug but not tight. You shouldn't feel any pulling pressure on the leg as you apply the tape.

, Attach a strip of tape to the anchor on the outer side of the leg. Pull the tape downwards towards the foot and wrap it around the sole of the foot. Attach the other end of the strip to the anchor on the inner side of the leg. This serves as a stirrup.


Do this twice more, to make a total of three stirrups. The stirrups should be side by side, not overlapping each other.
The stirrups are necessary as they prevent the ankle from moving outwards, keeping it stable and preventing further injury.

, Using athletes tape to lock the heels keeps the foot in a neutral position and reduces the risk of aggravating the sprain. Here's how to do it:


Place a strip of tape at the front of the leg, towards the lower part of the shin bone. Pull the tape diagonally downwards toward the inside of the leg and wrap it around the back of the heel.
Pass the tape under the sole of your foot (in front of the heel) and pull it back up over the instep until you reach the ankle on the opposite side.
Do the same thing again, this time starting on the opposite side of the ankle. This balances the pull of the heel locks and prevents injury from both sides.

, To close any gaps in the bandage (where the pre-wrap is exposed), start wrapping strips of tape around the foot, starting at the bottom of the pre-wrap, near the toes. Each strip should start and end at the top of the foot (not on the sole, as this could cause blisters).


Once you have finished covering the gaps on the foot, you can continue to wrap the athletic tape around the rest of the ankle and leg, using the same strip-by-strip technique.
Make sure the pre-wrap is entirely covered in the athletic tape — any gaps will serve as a weak point and potentially cause the tape to unravel.
There should be minimal pulling pressure applied on the tape. The goal is only to cover the gaps, not to compress the foot with tape.

, Repeat the process described above for making a heel lock, but this time use a stronger tape, such as Leukotape. This reinforces the neutral position of the ankle, even during physical activity,

, If the bandage is wrapped too tightly it can cut off the blood supply and become uncomfortable.


Check the nails for blood supply. Press on the nails and release. You should be able to see the nails return to pinkish color in less than two seconds. If it takes more than two seconds for the nails to turn pink, the taping is too tight.
Numbness or loss of feeling is a sign that there is inadequate blood flow to the foot. A tight tape can compress the blood vessels of the foot and cause numbness.
If the taping is too tight, you will need to undo it and wrap the ankle again.

, Resting your ankle is very important following a sprain. Avoid doing any physical activity or putting any pressure on the ankle during the first 48 hours following the injury, otherwise you risk making the sprain worse.


Stay sitting down as much as possible, and use crutches to move around if necessary.

, Ice your ankle as soon as possible following the injury, as this numbs the pain and helps to prevent swelling by shrinking the blood vessels beneath the skin and limiting blood flow to the area.


Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel or cloth to the affected area. Don't apply ice directly onto the swollen skin, as this can cause tissue damage.
Apply the ice pack for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 8 times a day for the first 48 hours following an injury., Compress the ankle with an elastic bandage or wrap (using the method described in the section above).This reduces swelling and helps to support the injured ankle.


Make sure that you don’t wrap the bandage so tight that you restrict blood supply. If your toes feel cold and start to turn blue, you should re-wrap the bandage.

, Keeping the ankle elevated above heart level helps to reduce swelling, as gravity prevents excess blood from accumulating around the site of the injury. Place a pillow or cushion beneath the ankle to keep it elevated while sitting or lying down.

, A high ankle sprain is also known as syndesmosis sprain. The syndesmotic ligament is a strong and fibrous connective tissue that links the tibia (shin bone) and fibula (outside bone) of the lower leg. This injury is known as “high” ankle sprain because the syndesmotic ligament is actually located above the ankle.


A regular or ""low ankle"" sprain occurs when the ligaments connecting the fibula to the foot are stretched or torn. This injury happens when you “roll over” on your ankle. This is the most common type of ankle sprain, and the recovery period is between 4 to 6 weeks.
A high ankle sprain, on the other hand, is a more severe type of ankle sprain because it may take between 2 to 6 months to recover. In most cases, this injury happens when you twist out your lower leg and foot. , The signs and symptoms of a high ankle sprain are more or less the same as a regular sprain, however, the pain and swelling will be located slightly higher on the ankle. To identify a high ankle sprain, look for the following:



Pain: Following an ankle sprain, the tissue surrounding the injury will release chemicals that stimulate the pain receptors.

Swelling: Swelling occurs at the site of the injury due to internal bleeding. Additionally, swelling occurs because more blood is being pumped to the area to aid healing.

Warmth: The skin surrounding the injured ankle is warm to touch, as the body tries to heat the area to kill potential bacteria that may cause infection.

Redness: The skin covering the ankle becomes pinkish-red in color. This is evidence of increased blood supply to the area.

, High ankle sprains are divided into three different categories — grade one, grade two and grade three — according to the severity of the injury. Recovery time will vary depending on what grade sprain you have.



Grade I: Grade I is the mildest type of ligament injury, as the syndesmosis is usually only stretched or slightly torn. Symptoms of a grade I injury may include swelling, tenderness, and stiffness. Though the ligament is injured, walking is still possible.

Grade II: Grade II sprains occur when the syndesmosis ligament is partially torn. The ankle is still somewhat stable but walking may be painful. There is tenderness, bruising, and swelling around the ankle.

Grade III: A Grade III sprain occurs when the syndesmosis ligament is completely torn. The ankle is no longer stable and feels wobbly. Walking is impossible or very difficult and may be accompanied by intense pain., If you have already suffered a high ankle sprain, you are more likely to re-injure yourself in the future. Therefore it's important to be aware of the risk factors for a high ankle sprain, so you can take preventative measures to avoid re-injury.


Sports are the most common risk factor when it comes to high ankle sprains. Injury may occur as a result of sudden and forceful motion, or when external force is applied to the leg. The sports that most commonly cause high ankle sprains include football, soccer, wrestling, hockey, basketball, and lawn tennis.
Certain medical conditions can make you more likely to sustain an ankle injury. For example, being overweight or obese puts greater strain on the legs for a prolonged period of time, making the ankles more prone to injury. Conditions which cause decreased muscle strength and bone integrity are also a risk factor for high ankle sprains.

Figure out the reason why you want to go barefoot: Is it healthier, a feeling of freedom, fashion, your philosophy, because others do it or because you think that will make you look cool?,
Start slowly, because the best way to start is to go barefoot at home to get your feet used to being open and free.,
Start walking outdoors on smooth textures, this will help you get your feet calloused a bit.,
Start walking on rougher surfaces such as asphalt, but do not do this during the summer, because it gets very hot.,
Start challenging yourself by walking over gravel for a short time.

,
Start going on good length walks over rough surfaces, that way your feet will be calloused even more.

,
Go barefoot everywhere.",How to Start Going Barefoot," If you wanted to start go barefoot in the past but thought you couldn't do it, think about the reasons for it (being shy, not sure how others will react to it, thinking your feet are gross, etc). Going barefoot is far easier than you think, because the most important thing to do is to take off your shoes and socks, especially when you get home from work or school.;
, When walking, do not shuffle and place your toes down first, then the heel.

, This will allow your feet to get used to direct contact with rough surfaces.

, Also, if your feet start aching, find a place to rest them and/or rub them with lotion.

,,, Some places will not let you in but most will accept it, and check with your employer to see if it is okay to go barefoot during the workday.

Make an appointment with your family doctor.,
Get a referral to an orthopedic specialist.,
Go see a podiatrist.",How to Straighten Toes1," If you've noticed that one or more of your toes are crooked, especially if pain or inflammation is involved, then make an appointment to see your doctor. Your family doctor is well-trained to be able to rule out anything serious (such as a fracture or infection), but remember your family doctor is not joint or foot specialist, so you may need to see a more specialized health professional to get the correct diagnosis.


Your doctor may decide to take an X-ray of your foot to get a better idea of the problem.
Your doctor may take blood from you and check your glucose levels because foot problems are common for people with diabetes.;
, Orthopods are joint specialists who correct joint problems via braces, splints, surgery or other invasive methods. You likely won't require surgery for your crooked toe, but your orthopod can correctly diagnose joint problems, evaluate whether arthritis is a factor and prescribe anti-inflammatories or analgesics (painkillers) if needed.


Your orthopedist may also want to take an X-ray, bone scan, MRI or diagnostic ultrasound to ascertain and properly diagnose your foot condition.

, A doctor who specializes in foot problems is called a podiatrist. Podiatrists can perform minor surgeries of the foot, but they usually focus more on foot/arch supports for your shoes (called orthotics), braces and custom made shoes.


A podiatrist is a great source of information on the most appropriate shoes for your feet.
Physical therapists, chiropractors and naturopaths may also be good sources of information regarding foot/toe conditions and offer natural, non-invasive treatments.

Raising your feet while relaxing at home will help to negate gravity and allow blood and lymph fluid to exit the lower legs and return into circulation.Taking your socks / nylons off will also help to reduce swelling, thus soothing them even further.


Raising your legs at or above your heart level is good for promoting circulation.
Use soft pillows to elevate your legs while laying on the sofa, but don't hamper blood flow by crossing your legs or ankles.;
, Soaking your legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle tension.The magnesium in the salt helps muscles relax. Don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding), but make it as warm as is tolerable — the warmer the water, the more effective the Epsom. Don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because salty water pulls fluid from your body and may dehydrate you.


If swelling is a particular problem in your legs, then follow the warm salt bath with an ice bath until your legs start to feel numb (about 15 minutes or so).
Always remember to dry your feet thoroughly after a bath so as to prevent slip and falls.

, If you're walking long distances, maybe the stress in your legs is due to muscle strain. Mild muscle strains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves muscle tension and promotes blood flow.The three main muscles groups to focus on are your calves, quadriceps, and hamstrings. In general, hold stretches (without bouncing) for about 30 seconds. Do these three to five times daily, until the discomfort in your legs decreases.


For a quad stretch while standing, brace yourself against a wall, flex your knee, and try to pull your foot such that your heel touches your buttocks.
For a hamstring stretch while standing, bend over at the waist and try to touch your toes.
Warming up and stretching your leg muscles prior to walking or any athletic activity may help prevent injuries such as strains, sprains, and muscle cramps., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or aspirin are short-term solutions to help you deal with tension, pain or inflammation in your legs. Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than two weeks on a constant basis.


Dosage for adults is usually 200–400 mg, by mouth, every four to six hours.Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to soothe your legs, but never take them along with NSAIDs.
Be careful not to take medications on an empty stomach, as they can increase the risk of ulcers.

, Ill-fitting and/or excessively heavy shoes also contribute to tired and sore legs. As such, wear stable, lightweight footwear that suits your job, sport or activity. Aim for no more than a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) heel. High heels crowd the toes and create more tension in the calf muscles and Achilles tendons.If you're a serious runner, replace your shoes every 350–500 miles (560–800 km) or three months, whichever comes first.


Remember to always tie your shoes tightly, because loose shoes or flip-flops puts more strain on your lower leg muscles.
Minor leg injuries such as shin splints are often caused by walking (or running) uphill, on uneven terrain or on hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.As such, alter your course and change the type of surface you walk on — switch to grass or dirt, for example.

, Weight loss helps prevent a variety of musculoskeletal problems as there's less pressure put on the bones and muscles of the feet and lower legs. For most women, consuming less than 2,000 calories daily will lead to some weight loss every week even if you're only a light exerciser. Most men will lose weight at under 2,200 calories daily.Switch to lean meats and fish, whole grains, fresh produce and lots of water for the best weight loss results.
Many overweight people have flat feet and tend to over-pronate their ankles, so choosing shoes with excellent arch support is crucial.

, Get a massage therapist to give you a thorough leg massage, focusing on the calves, shins, quads, and hamstrings. Massage reduces muscle tension and inflammation, helps break down scar tissue and promotes better blood flow.The therapist should start near the inner thighs, work his way down the leg, and then back up the leg to properly remove lymph.


Ask the therapist to use essential oils (such as lavender) on your legs because it will help calm you and relieve stress.Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid, and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for stress or leg discomfort can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain and stress.


Find a licensed acupuncturist and ask friends for recommendations.Most states require acupuncturists get certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine before they are allowed to practice., If you have flat feet or shin splints and spend lots of time standing or walking then consider a pair of orthotics. Orthotics are customized shoe inserts that support the arch of your foot and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking and running, which helps prevent stress and tension from building up in your leg muscles.Orthotics will also help reduce the risk of problems developing in joints such as the ankles, knees, and hips.


Health professionals that make custom orthotics include podiatrists and some osteopaths and chiropractors.
As an alternative to customized orthotics, consider a pair of off-the-shelf orthopedic shoe insoles — they're considerably less expensive and may provide quick relief.

, A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your legs, and if need be, treat your sore muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.A physical therapist can also develop an exercise routine / program that will help you lose weight, which is helpful for stress reduction.


Physiotherapy is often required two to three times per week for four to six weeks to positively impact musculoskeletal problems.
Good strengthening exercises for your legs, aside from walking, include cycling, rollerblading, beach volleyball, swimming, and weight training.

, If your leg pain is chronic, aggravated by walking or particularly severe, then seeing a chiropractor or osteopath is a good idea. Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the spinal joints that connect the vertebrae by manually adjusting them. Problems in the spine, such as a disc herniation, ""pinched"" nerves, or degenerative arthritis, can cause pain, numbness and/or weakness in the legs — making it difficult to walk.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your issue, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.
Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your leg issue.

, Medical specialists may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of chronic leg problems, such as diabetic neuropathy, venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves of the lower leg), stress fracture of the tibia, infections, bone cancer, chronic compartment syndrome (swelling of the lower leg muscles), or popliteal artery entrapment.These conditions are obviously not common causes of tired and sore legs, but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective for soothing your legs, then more serious problems need to be considered.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scans, diagnostic ultrasound and nerve conductance studies are diagnostic tests and modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your leg issue.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out diabetes, inflammatory arthritis or a bone infection.
You may be given compression socks to wear if the veins in your lower legs are weak or leaky.

, If the stress is too great in your life and it's causing musculoskeletal and/or emotional problems, then talk with a mental health professional. Aside from helping with stress, anxiety and depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy can also help with musculoskeletal pain.Mental health professionals sometimes recommend mood altering medications such as antidepressants, which can also impact the musculoskeletal system.
More natural stress-relieving practices include meditation, yoga, tai chi, and deep breathing exercises.

Don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.


If swelling is a particular problem in your feet, then follow the warm salt bath with an ice bath until your feet feel numb (about 15 minutes or so).
Always remember to dry your feet thoroughly after a foot bath so as to prevent slip and falls.

, Rolling your tired feet over a wooden roller (found at many drug stores) is a good way to massage the tension out of your feet and potentially relieve mild-to-moderate discomfort.For some reason, natural wood seems to work better at soothing muscles than plastic, glass, or metal. Look for grooved or ribbed varieties.


Place the wooden roller on the ground, perpendicular to your feet, and firmly roll them back and forth slowly for at least five to 10 minutes each.
Repeat as many times as necessary, although your feet might be a little sore after the first time your use a roller.

, Get a massage therapist to give you a foot and calf massage. Massage reduces muscle tension and inflammation, helps break down scar tissue and promotes better blood flow.Have the therapist start rubbing from the toes and work towards the calf so the venous blood and lymph are helped back up towards the heart.


The therapist may also perform trigger point therapy on the soles of your feet, which is sustained pressure to the most sore spots within your arches.
Ask the therapist to use peppermint oil or cream on your feet because it will make them tingle and feel invigorating.
Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid, and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for foot pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists, and massage therapists.

, Some people confuse reflexology with massage, but although both use touch and pressures points, the approaches are very different. Reflexology is the application of appropriate pressure to specific points and areas on the feet in efforts to stimulate specific organs and improve health in general.Massage therapists work ""from the outside in"" — manipulating specific muscle groups or fascia to release tension; reflexology practitioners work ""from the inside out"" — stimulating the nervous system to release tension in the feet and elsewhere.
Reflexology is similar to acupuncture and acupressure in that it works with the body's vital energy through the stimulation of points on the feet, as well as points in the hands and ears.

, If your foot pain is chronic or particularly severe, then seeing a podiatrist is a good idea. Podiatrists are foot specialists who can treat a variety of conditions, sometimes with simple surgical techniques, but more often with conservative approaches such as custom orthotics, orthopedic shoes, braces or taping.A podiatrist can tell you if you're suffering from common foot conditions such as plantar fasciitis, athlete's foot (fungal infection), flat feet, turf toe, bunions, or gout — which all cause foot pain to varying degrees.
A podiatrist is a great source of information on what types of shoes are best for your feet and gait (the way that you walk).

, Medical specialists may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of chronic foot problems, such as diabetes, infection, venous insufficiency, bone fracture, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.These conditions are obviously not common causes of tired and tender feet, but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective for soothing your feet, then more serious problems need to be considered.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, and CT scans are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your upper back pain.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or a chronic infection.

, An injection of steroid medication near or into the inflamed tendons or muscles of your foot can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, but this approach is usually reserved for athletes who need quick and temporary relief that enables them to keep performing.The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone.


Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy, and nerve irritation/damage.
If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution, then surgery should be considered as a last resort, depending on the diagnosis of your foot condition.

Take care of the pain.,
Change your shoes.,
Get a splint.,
Consider bunion surgery.",How to Straighten Toes2," A bunion is a chronically sprained and inflamed joint that forms when the big toe is constantly pushed towards the smaller toes, usually by wearing ill-fitting shoes or shoes that are too narrow (such as high heels).Flat feet also contribute to bunion formation, which can mimic rheumatoid or osteoarthritis because of the inflammation, redness and dull, achy pain involved. As bunions progress, the big toe becomes more crooked and generates more pain, which may lead to limping and other joint problems in the ankle or knee.


Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) or analgesics (such as acetaminophen) can combat the swelling and pain caused by bunions.
If the pain is severe, stronger medications may be prescribed by your family doctor or orthopod (such as COX-2 inhibitors or morphine-based drugs).
Steroid injections directly into the joint can be effective for combating pain and inflammation.

, The vast majority of bunions occur in women who wear shoes that are too narrow. Changing to shoes that have a wider toe box and better arch support can certainly stop the progression and pain of a bunion, but it probably won't straighten the big toe back to its normal position. After giving up high-fashion shoes, if the bunion is still painful and limits activity, then surgery should be considered.


You should be able to wiggle your toes while your shoes are on.
There should be at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space between the tips of your big toes and the end of your shoes while standing up.
Athletic shoes and walking sandals are generally good choices.

, Taping a plastic, wooden or metal splint around the affected toe might help reduce the pain and realign the joint, depending on how long you've had the bunion. Silicone or felt pads worn on the feet or as shoe inserts may also relieve bunion pain, but it depends on the degree of joint damage. Orthopods, podiatrists, physical therapists and chiropractors could all be of help with splints or shoe orthotics.


Arch supports and orthotics realign the shape of your foot, correcting balance and weight distribution throughout the muscles of your feet and toes.
Massages, gentle stretching and ice baths may also help reduce the pain and dysfunction of bunions.

, Bunion surgery often involves shaving the bone and/or strategically breaking it so it can be set straight.Surgical pins and wires are often needed to hold the toe bones in place while you heal. For severely damaged joints, the joint might be fused together or even completely removed and replaced with an artificial joint. The goal of surgery is pain relief and increased mobility, not to create a ""prettier"" foot or make it possible to wear high-heel shoes again. If tight, pointy shoes are worn after surgery, then most likely the bunion will come back.


Bunion correction is an outpatient surgery. After the surgery, the foot is covered with a bulky, compressive bandage.
Bone typically takes six weeks to heal, so wearing a protective boot for a minimum of six weeks after surgery is common.During this time, avoid excessive or unnecessary walking.

Get your toe realigned.,
Support your toe until it heals.,
Strengthen your toe with exercises.",How to Straighten Toes3," Toe dislocations are a relatively common consequence of foot trauma, whether it's accidental (such as stubbing your toe) or intentional (such as kicking a soccer ball). A dislocated toe is certainly painful and looks misaligned, but it doesn't usually involve a fracture. Realigning the dislocated toe with some sort of manual procedure or adjustment (practiced by medical doctors, podiatrists and chiropractors), is the most appropriate treatment. Pain relief often follows immediately after treatment.


Dislocations don't often spontaneously realign without intervention from a health professional.
The longer a joint is dislocated, the greater the chance of permanent ligament and/or tendon damage, so getting treatment soon after injury is important.

, Once your toe joint is realigned again, it's important to support it with a splint or strong medical tape because the ligaments and tendons that keep the joint straight may be temporarily stretched or weakened. As a consequence, the newly straightened toe may be somewhat unstable for a few days until the connective tissues can strengthen.


Consider making your own splint with popsicle sticks and trainer's tape.

, Shortly after your dislocated toe has been realigned and stabilized, you should strengthen it with specific exercises. Towel curls (using your toes to crumple up or pick up a towel from the floor) and marble pick-ups (picking up marbles from the floor with your toes) work well for strengthening the tendons and muscles of your toes and foot.


Talk to your doctor before beginning a toe exercise routine, especially if you have other medical conditions such as arthritis or diabetes.
If these exercises do not work well or are painful to perform, see a physical therapist or podiatrist for more personalized assistance.

Get your hammertoe fixed.,
Get your claw toe fixed.,
Get your mallet toe fixed.",How to Straighten Toes4," Hammertoe, also known as a contracted toe, is a deformity of the second, third or fourth toe caused by a contraction at the most proximal joint, which results in a hammer-like appearance. Hammertoes are usually flexible in the initial stages but may become rigid if they are not treated appropriately. Hammertoes are caused by wearing shoes that are too small or too narrow, or by wearing high heels that put excessive pressure on the muscle groups of the toe.


Hammertoe can be fixed by surgery (cutting and stretching the contracted tendon, then placing a metal pin/wire next to the joint for support), or aggressive stretching regimens on a daily basis. Splints and supports can also be effective for alleviating hammertoe.
Use your fingers to massage around the toe, then manually pull (stretch) the hammertoe, holding each stretch for several seconds. Continue this routine multiple times daily for weeks or until you see substantial improvement.

, Claw toe means that your toe becomes hooked in appearance due to contraction (flexion) of the proximal and distal joints, which forces the end of the toe to dig into the shoe's sole. Painful calluses or corns develop at the very end of the affected toe. Claw toes are caused by wearing shoes that are too small and also by some diseases (such as diabetes) or conditions (tendon contractions).


Claw toes can also be fixed by similar surgical methods used for hammertoe, which includes cutting and stretching the contracted tendons.
Try walking on the tips of your toes, which will cause extension (and stretching) of the contracted tendons/joints.

, Mallet toe is similar to claw toe but involves abnormal positioning only at the most distal joint (at the end of the toe). Mallet toe is commonly caused by shoes that are too tight in the toe box or ones that possess high heels. The forces these shoes place on your feet cause unnatural bending of your toes.


Mallet toes can also be fixed by similar surgical methods used for hammertoes and claw toes — cutting and stretching the contracted tendons.
Every attempt should be made to spread your toes while barefoot. A toe-spacing product can be worn to help re-approximate your toes to the correct anatomical position.

Place the tub in front of a comfortable chair, with a towel underneath to catch any spills.;
, Lighting and sound can have profound effects on mood. To create a calm, spa-like atmosphere, dim the lights- bright, harsh lighting will ruin the relaxing vibe you're going for.Choose soothing background music, like classical music or white noise. Music has been proven to enhance relaxation and restore harmony between mind and body., Avoid filling up your foot bath at your bathtub or sink, as you will then have to transport it to your relaxation area. Instead, add water to the foot tub with a pitcher or kettle to make things easier and to prevent spills. You can adjust the temperature to your liking by slowly adding boiling water and then cold water, alternating between the two until the bath is just right.


If you are using an electric foot bath, make sure to leave the machine unplugged until after you have filled it with water to avoid the risk of an electrical shock.

, There are a host of ingredients that can be added to a foot soak to help and soothe tired feet. Scour your kitchen cupboards or visit a health food store to find the perfect additions to your foot bath. Some of the best, foot-friendly ingredients are:


peppermint, which can invigorate skin and muscles and reduce inflammationvinegar, which can help treat foot fungus, odor, and athlete's footepsom salts, which can relieve muscle pain, tension and joint inflammationlemon, which can be energizing, Aromatherapy is believed to treat ailments and relieve stress through the use of fragrant, essential oils.In addition to their healing potential, essential oils can make your foot soak especially indulgent. For a relaxing effect, try vanilla or lavender essential oils, which have been shown to be calming.Consult with a doctor first if you have one of the following conditions: a lung condition, such as asthma, respiratory allergies, chronic lung disease; skin allergies; or pregnancy (some oils may cause uterine contractions)., An easy alternative to DIY foot soaks is to purchase one at a bath and body boutique, pharmacy or department store. Look for products that include soothing ingredients like epsom salts or peppermint, and have fun shopping around for scents that you enjoy. Bath ""bombs"" or ""fizzies"" are popular foot soak options that you can watch dissolve as you enjoy their soothing properties.

, Test out the water before you soak your feet- the temperature should be between 92° to 100 °F (37.8 °C). Anything above 104° F is considered unsafe, especially for people with certain conditions, such as poor circulation and pregnancy.Immerse your feet and soak them for 10 to 30 minutes, depending on your comfort level. Relax and enjoy the experience!


While you are soaking your feet, you could entertain yourself by reading a book or magazine or by simply closing your eyes and listening to the background music.

, Exfoliating your feet removes dead skin and leaves feet feeling smooth and refreshed. Use a pumice stone or foot file to slough away rough skin. You can also use an exfoliating scrub, or make one of your own by combining some of the following natural, ingredients:


Sugar and baby oilEpsom salt and lavender oilSalt and mineral oil, After exfoliating, rinse your feet thoroughly. Dry them gently with a towel. Trim your toenails if necessary and apply a rich, moisturizing lotion to feet; lotions that contain synthetic urea are especially good for dry feet.As a final, pampering touch, put on a comfortable pair of socks or slippers.

Gather your materials.,
Wash your foot.,
Anchor the tape.,
Cross the foot with tape.,
Tape horizontally.,
Tape throughout the day.",How to Tape a Foot for Plantar Fasciitis1," You need sports tape to tape your foot using this method. You can get rolls of sports tape at superstores, supermarkets, or drugstores. A roll of tape should last for three to five tapings.Make sure that when you apply the tape that you keep all wrinkles out of the tape. This can cause blisters or other irritation.
Tape should be wrapped lightly. You don’t want the tape to be too tight on your foot.;
, Before you tape your foot, make sure you wash your foot with non-moisturizing soap. This helps the tape stick to your foot when applied. Make sure your foot is completely dry before starting., To start the taping process, tape a piece of tape around the ball of your foot. This is the area just behind your toes on your foot. Wrap the tape all the way around so it’s on the top and bottom of your foot.The next anchoring point the foot. Wrap a piece of tape around the back of your ankle. The tape should run around the ankle and down both sides of your foot until it meets the tape around the ball of your foot. Stick the two sections of tape together.
This should not be tight. The tape should be loose on your feet, and you should complete this step while your foot is relaxed.
Smooth any wrinkles out of the tape as you go to prevent blisters.

, Stick one end of the tape on your foot just below your big toe. Then tape diagonally across the bottom of your foot. Wrap the tape around the hell, then tape it diagonally the other way across the bottom of your foot. Take the end under your pinky toe.At this point, you should have a large X across the bottom of your foot with tape. The center of the X should be in the middle of your foot.
Repeat taping this X three more times. This provides support to the plantar fascia.

, The last step of the taping is to tape horizontal lines along the sole of your foot. These horizontal strips of tape will overlap so that you cannot see any of your foot. They will cover the entire bottom of your foot from the heel to the anchor going around the ball of your foot.At the end, wrap a piece of tape all the way around the ball of your foot again, including the top of your foot, to provide extra support. This should be the only piece of tape on the top of your foot.
You don’t have to wrap all the way around your foot. Instead, tear each piece of tape at the edge of your foot, making what looks like a tape shoe.

, You should tape your feet whenever you are going to engage in a lot of physical activity, such as before exercising or before going to work.You don’t want to leave the tape on too long. Refrain from leaving the tape on all day or overnight."

Determine if you need further medical help.,
Use the RICE treatment method.,
Consider applying heat.,
Massage your sore ankle gently to relax the muscles around it.,
Stretch your ankle up and down.,
Stretch your ankle in.,
Stretch your ankle out.,
Stretch with stairs.,
Create a plan for reducing or treating the cause of your sore ankles now.If you have been walking or exercising too much, you can do lighter exercise or more slowly increase your exercise load to avoid soreness.,
Warm up before playing sports or exercising.,
Take other measures throughout your day to ensure strong, healthy ankles.",How to Soothe a Sore Ankle," Lay them on a soft object and avoid moving them for as long as needed. Depending on your soreness, you might want to rest for longer than 30 minutes, even up to a whole day. Consider stopping the activity that caused your soreness, or putting rest increments in between sessions of the activity.


If your foot is incredibly sore, immobilize and avoid touching it for the first few hours.
Elevate your ankles above your heart. This makes it a little more difficult for blood to flow to your sore area, reducing the risk of swelling.
Rest in a location where others will not disturb you, like a chair in your living room or your bed.
If your ankle continues to hurt, apply the RICE method as outlined in Part 2.;
, Does anything look or feel different? Take note of swelling, discoloration, asymmetries between both feet, abnormal movement, or pain. Slight swelling normally accompanies ankle soreness but should not be debilitating. If you notice anything more than soreness and slight swelling--examples are listed below--record it and contact a doctor. Any of these sign may warrant an ankle x ray:


Rapid and sudden swelling that was not expected
Discoloration
Literal skin sores, bruises, open wounds, or infections
Asymmetries between both feet or legs
Abnormal joint movement
A different quality of pain than soreness (sharp, burning, cold, tingling)
A large temperature difference in your foot or ankle and rest of body
Lack of sensation in your foot or ankle

, Most often, sore ankles are the result of overuse: walking or running too much. However, ankle soreness, swelling, and other pain can be the result of more serious medical conditions. If any of the below apply to your sore ankles, contact a doctor: You are more than 20 weeks pregnant, and your ankles swelled rapidly and excessively. Sudden swelling of the ankles might indicate preeclampsia, or high blood pressure. Preeclampsia requires immediate medical attention.
There is soreness in only one of your ankles, though you used both equally. This can be a sign that something is wrong with your one ankle beyond overuse.
The soreness persists or worsens over time.
Ankle soreness and foot pain are listed as a side effect of a medication you are taking.
Ankle soreness and foot pain are listed as symptoms of a more serious medical condition you experience. This includes diabetes.
You may need to use crutches until you're able to walk with normal gait.

, RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. This is the standard method for treating a sore joint.


Make sure to rest the joint and use crutches if you are not able to bear weight.
Apply ice to the joint to limit swelling. Applying ice is recommended for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours for the first 48 hours or until swelling is improved. You can use a sealed bag of ice, chemical ice pack, frozen peas, frozen meat, or any other cold object. If you leave ice on 1 location for more than 30 minutes, you risk longterm damage to your body part. Putting a towel between your skin and the ice can make it more comfortable, but will decrease the benefits of icing. The smaller the window of time is between onset of soreness and application of ice, the sooner the soreness will be alleviated.
Use a compressive device such as an elastic bandage to limit swelling and inflammation.
Elevate the ankle above the heart to increase blood and lymphatic drainage back to the heart. Also the use of NSAIDS is warranted to reduce inflammation.

, Wrap your sore ankle with a warm object for 10-15 minutes once a day to increase blood circulation and decrease joint stiffness. Warmth can increase muscle flexibility and relaxation.You can use a warm water bottle, towel, or electric blanket.
If you use a hot object, you risk burning or irritating your skin in addition to irritating damaged muscles around your ankle.
Placing a towel between your skin and the warm object can make it more comfortable and better regulate the heat of the object.

, Also try massaging the rest of your foot and calf to relax the other parts of your body that might be contributing to your sore ankle.


Ask someone else to massage your feet, but give yourself a massage if no one else can do so.
Place a tennis ball underneath your sore foot and roll it around. Apply your weight gently so that you do not slip and fall, but enough to mimic a massage.Know the physiology of the foot well before performing deep and intense massages.

, While sitting, use the muscles in your shin and top of foot to make a right angle and bring your toes upward. Count to 10. Then lower your foot to make a straight line with your shin and top of foot. Count to 10. Repeat 10 times in 1 day., While sitting, curl your foot inwards so that your outer ankle is close to the ground and you can see the side of your big toe. This stretches out your ankle. Count to 10. Repeat 10 times in 1 day., While sitting, curl your foot outwards so that your big toe and heel are touching the ground, but you are using your ankle and outer foot to lift your pinky toe off the ground. This exercises your ankle muscles. Count to 10. Repeat 10 times in 1 day., Stand on the edge of a stair, drop your ankles down a few inches to stretch the back of your foot and calf. Hold this position for a count of 10. Slowly and steadily rise back up to your starting position. Repeat 10 times in 1 day., Use the exercises listed in this article even when your ankles are no longer sore to strengthen your foot muscles.
If the cause is medical, work out a treatment plan with your doctor. This may mean losing weight, taking medication, or changing your lifestyle.

, Stretching and warming up can greatly reduce muscle injury and soreness. Ask your trainer or coach for specific warm-ups geared towards your sport.Warm-ups usually consist of light exercises focused on your ankles, not literally warming up your ankle with heat. However, some exercise regimens devised by experts do involve temperature control.

,


Wear comfortable and supportive shoes that do not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) in heel height nor irritate your feet. Consider high tops for activities that may strain your ankles.
While sitting, have good posture and place your feet flat on the floor. Do not cross your ankles or bend them awkwardly while seated.
Sleep with your legs and ankles relaxed in a relatively straight fashion; your ankles should not be bent or stretched.
Exercise regularly so that intense periods of exercise do not induce ankle soreness.
Consume proper nutrients in your diet to help your bones and muscles stay strong; lack of calcium, vitamins, or other minerals can cause greater muscle stiffness and bone weakness.
Do stretching, strengthening, and proprioceptive exercises.
Consider getting your ankle taped.

Gather the materials.,
Sit in a comfortable position.,
Secure the stretch of your foot.,
Take caution during the night.",How to Tape a Foot for Plantar Fasciitis2," To stretch your foot, you will need a few items. You will need a long shoelace or ribbon. You also will need a tube sock you have modified.


The tube sock needs a shoe lace or ribbon loop sewn into the toe of the sock and to the top of the sock. You can easily do this with needle and thread.

, To begin stretching your foot, sit down in a comfortable position. You may want to place your ankle on your opposite knee.Put the sock on your affected foot.


Make sure you keep your toes flexed during this so you get the best stretch. However, don’t stretch it so far that it feels painful.

, Gently pull your toes up toward your head. Keep your toes stretched so you feel the extension in your foot.Thread the shoelace or piece of ribbon you have through each loop on the tube sock. You should feel a gentle stretch and shouldn’t feel any pain.


Tie the shoelace or ribbon so that your foot remains in the stretched position, your toes pointing toward your face. You should also feel some stretch in your calf.
Be careful that you don’t overstretch the tendon.

, Be careful when you get out of bed during the night for any reason. Also use caution when you wake in the morning. Before you get out of bed, untie or loosen the shoelace or ribbon. Re-tie it when you get back into bed.


You stretch your foot at night so that your foot can heal in a stretched position. Keeping it gently stretched helps to loosen the tight or lengthen the shortened plantar fascia."

Understand the importance of taping or stretching your foot.,
Recognize the symptoms of plantar fasciitis.,
Learn the causes of plantar fasciitis.",How to Tape a Foot for Plantar Fasciitis3," Taping your foot to treat plantar fasciitis can reduce the pain associated with plantar fasciitis. It helps support your foot when you engage in physical activity to reduce strain.It can also help minimize stress and inflammation.


Keeping your foot stretched helps your foot loosen and heal in an elongated position so it doesn’t shorten during the night. The main goal in taping your foot is to keep the foot flexed, with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head, until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Make sure you only feel a gentle stretch in your foot.

, You may start seeing symptoms when you feel pain under your heel or in the arch of your foot. This often occurs when you stand up in the morning or after resting your feet for an extended period of time.After some time walking, the pain decreases.


Pain may be felt after long periods of standing, physical activity, running, or sitting. Many times, the pain is felt while exercising.
The pain is usually described as stabbing, but it can also be described as aching or burning., The plantar fascia bears all our weight and has been described as a sort of bowstring supporting the arch of the foot. Anything that causes increased strain on this area of the foot can cause plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis may occur when the plantar fascia tightens, shortens, or becomes inflamed.Causes include:Obesity
Footwear that does not support the arch adequately or fits improperly
Overload because of physical activity, such as running, jumping, or jogging
Arthritis
Diabetes
Existing foot problems, such as flat feet or high arches
Abnormal gait and way of walking
Overtraining

Consult a physician.",How to Recover From a Foot Injury," Are you unable to put weight on the foot? Is it becoming very swollen? If so, this may mean that your injury is more serious than a minor sprain or strain – meaning damage to a ligament or muscle, respectively. If the foot cannot bear weight, you should see a doctor for tests and X-rays. This will help determine the extent of your injury, particularly whether or not you have fractured a bone. Strains and most sprains do not require surgery; fractures sometimes do. Consult your doctor., You should rest your foot for 48 to 72 hours and limit the activity that caused the injury. Avoiding putting weight on the foot. Likewise, use crutches if necessary. Some minor use should be fine if the foot is not broken, but in general you should stay put., Your body's immediate response to a physical trauma is to flood the area with blood. This causes swelling or inflammation. To reduce swelling and pain, apply ice wrapped a towel to the foot for about 30 minutes every two to three hours for the first 48 to 72 hours. At the same time, be careful not to over-ice your foot. Do not sleep with the icepack on or let it touch the skin directly, as this could lead to a cold burn or frostbite.A bag of frozen peas will work in a pinch if you don't have ready access to ice.

, Another way to reduce swelling is to let gravity work in your favor. Elevate the injury. Lay down and place your foot on a pillow, keeping it slightly above the level of your heart to prevent fluid from pooling., Still another way to reduce swelling is by compressing the foot. Wraps, bandages, and braces will also limit the motion of the foot and prevent you from injuring it further. You can buy compression devices at any pharmacy. They should be applied snugly around the affected area, but not so tightly that they limit blood flow. Remove the bandage when you sleep., If the pain bothers you, take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain reliever like aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). These can be bought at any pharmacy and will reduce pain as well as swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is not an anti-inflammatory, meaning that it will reduce pain but not swelling. Follow the proper dosages.


Keep in mind that drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen can cause medical problems in high dosages or with chronic use, like internal bleeding. You should not take them for a long period without talking to your doctor.Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers under 19 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal condition., You should avoid aggravating your foot injury for the first 72 hours by being cautious. Do not run or engage in any form of exercise that could cause more damage. Do not use hot baths, saunas, or heat packs, drink alcohol, or massage the injury. Any of these activities can might increase bleeding and swelling, slowing your healing., Your doctor will give you advice on how to recover. She may recommend using crutches for a time or prescribe a program of physiotherapy. In a worse case, she may also give you a referral to a specialist who can better assess your injury.

, Many healthcare professionals recommend that you continue to move your ankle in case of a sprain. The joint will heal faster if you begin moving it without pain, in a full range of motion. However, muscle strains can be different. If you have injured a muscle rather than a ligament, your doctor might tell you to keep the foot immobilized for several days and prescribe a cast, splint, or brace to protect it. The aim is to keep you from further tearing the injured muscle. You should be able to use your foot again once healing has started., Once the swelling has gone down and the pain has subsided, you will be able to put weight on your foot again. Start slowly. Your activity should be light. You will probably notice some amount of stiffness or soreness at first. This is natural and should go away as your muscles and ligaments become accustomed to use again. Warm up and stretch before exercising. Increase the duration and level of intensity over a period of several days.Try a low impact exercise to start. Swimming, for example, is much easier on the feet than running.
If you feel any sudden, sharp pain, stop your activity immediately.

, Your shoes should give you stable balance and not put you at risk of re-injury. High heels are out, obviously. Buy new shoes if you think that your injury was a result of insufficient cushioning. Arch supports might help, too, while another option is a therapy boot. These have velcro to ensure stability and make walking easier. You can get them from your doctor for between $100–$200.

, Crutches can help you get back to your routine, if your recovery is a longer one or if you still cannot put full weight on the foot. The most common kind of crutch is the axillary crutch. To fit properly, the crutch should come about two to three inches below your armpit while you are standing up straight. Your hands will hang over the crutches and rest on hand-grips. Put your weight on the healthy side. Move the crutches in front of you and, shifting your weight to your arms, swing your body through the crutches. Do not support yourself on your armpits — this can cause nerve damage. Rather, hold the hand-grips for support.Canes work slightly differently. A cane is not meant to be used on your weak side. Instead, it is meant to support the healthy side and the extra weight that it is bearing because of your injury., While not always necessary, your doctor may refer you to physiotherapist to restore your joint mobility, muscle strength, and proper gait. Feet and ankles bear lots of weight. They are therefore one of the most common sites of injury. A physiotherapist will design exercises for you based on your injury, with an eye to gradually returning your muscles and ligaments to full health. You may be asked to do strength training with resistance bands, for example, or exercises in balance like standing on one foot.Physiotherapists will also show you how to properly tape your foot before exercise. Taping will give the still-injured foot added support.

, It should take about a week or two before you can walk again. You may be able to resume all of your normal activities within several months. Bear in mind that foot injuries vary, however, and that in worse scenarios you may require more time. In some cases people experience pain, swelling, and instability for months or even years after the initial injury. See your doctor if you experience a sudden increase in swelling or pain or sudden tingling or numbness. , Talk to your doctor if your injured foot does not recover or is taking more time than expected. She may consider referring you to an orthopedic specialist, who can determine the best course of action. Minor sprains and muscle strains rarely require surgery, either because surgery is less effective than non-invasive treatment or because it does not justify the risk. However, some cases of severe muscle strain (usually suffered by professional athletes) require surgery in order to restore the muscle to its full, former strength. Only a trained medical specialist can make this determination."

Clean the area thoroughly before beginning.,
Soak your toenail.,
Sterilize your tools.,
Clip the nail.,
Place cotton or dental floss under the nail.,
Clean the nail again.,
Watch for complications.,
See a doctor for any problems.",How to Remove an Ingrown Toenail1," With any sort of procedure or treatment, infection is a concern. If you have an ingrown toenail, there's a good chance that the skin around it is tight, irritated and inflamed already, making it vulnerable. Clean your toe using antibacterial soap and water to start.

If you notice any signs of infection, such as pus or sharp pain, do not treat the toenail yourself. Cleaning it will not help at this point. Make an appointment with a doctor.;
, Before you attempt to remove an ingrown toenail, soak it in a warm bath. This helps soften your skin and reduce swelling, allowing you to get to the toenail easier. Place your foot in warm water with some Epsom salt and allow it to soak for a few minutes before attempting to remove the toenail., It's always a good idea to sterilize and wash any tools you're using prior to removing an ingrown toenail. You will be using tweezers and








To sterilize tweezers and nail clippers, wash them in warm water and mild dish detergent. Rinse them completely under running water and then pat them dry with a lint free cloth.
If a tool falls anywhere very dirty, like a toilet, throw it out. You're better off using a fresh pair of tweezers or nail clippers than risking infection.

, Some ingrown toenails can simply be clipped off. Use a small pair of nail clippers to clip the ingrown nail. Make sure to cut the nail into an oval or curved shape. Simply trimming off the ingrown portion may not be effective, as the nail may grow back in the same fashion. Cutting your nail into a curve can help it grow out normally.







, Another option with ingrown toenails is to separate them from the skin and let them grow out of the ingrown shape. To do this, roll a piece of clean, sterile cotton between your fingers to form a small roll or wick, or use a piece of dental floss (use the unflavored kind or it may burn). Slip the cotton or dental floss under the ingrown edge of the nail to prop it up. The cotton or dental floss will act as a barrier to prevent the nail from growing inwards. Replace the cotton each night before bed. Your toenail should grow out of the ingrown shape with the help of the cotton or dental floss.







, Regardless of the method you used, clean your nail again after removing the toenail. If you used cotton, clean around the cotton to avoid getting it wet. Always apply antibiotic ointment after treating an ingrown toenail. This can help prevent infection.








You can buy an antibiotic ointment at a local drug store.

, After treating the nail yourself, be vigilant. If you notice any complications, you should have the ingrown nail assessed by a doctor. Watch for the following:








Intense pain or sensitivity
Pus or fluid drainage
Abscess (fluid-filled sore or blister)
Major redness and swelling
Fever or flu-like symptoms

, While the home remedies described above may work well for non-serious ingrown toenails, they may not necessarily work for all ingrown toenails or cases that have progressed beyond a certain point. If your ingrown toenail doesn't seem to go away, becomes worse, or shows signs of an infection, make an appointment with your doctor or a foot specialist as soon as you can.








Medical professionals have a variety of options available for treating badly ingrown toes, including prescribing medicines and removing part of the affected nail. A qualified doctor will be able to find a method that works given your condition.

Soak the toe in hot water to ease pain.,
Apply antiseptic cream.,
Bandage the toe to protect it.,
Take over-the-counter medication.",How to Remove an Ingrown Toenail2," Even if your ingrown toe treatment is successful, your toe may remain sore for a few days. To reduce pain, soak the affected foot in hot water. The water should be warm, but not so hot that it's painful. Soak your toe for up to 15 to 20 minutes, up to four times each day. Use only clean water and a clean, sterile tub or bowl to soak your foot.








Some sources claim that adding Epsom Salts to hot baths can help ease pain more than just hot water. This is not yet definitively proven, but it is by no means unsafe to use Epsom Salts., Since preventing infection is a major concern with ingrown toenails, it's a good idea to apply antiseptic creams and ointments to the affected nail semi-frequently to halt the growth of any bacteria. Purchase an antiseptic cream at a local drug store and apply it according to package instructions. If you notice any adverse reactions, stop using the cream and talk to a doctor.








If you had your ingrown toe treated at a doctor's office, ask your doctor to recommend an antibacterial cream.

, One great way to prevent infection in an ingrown toe is simply to keep any sort of infectious material out of the wound entirely. After applying antiseptic, try covering the affected toe with loose gauze or a bandage. This will keep the toe clean and clear of any bacteria.








For long-term use, be sure to remove the bandage, clean the wound, and re-apply a new bandage daily.

, If your ingrown toenail is giving you pain or discomfort after treating it with a home remedy, you don't simply have to grin and bear it. Try using an appropriate dosage of an over-the-counter containing Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen (like Motrin, Advil, Tylenol). These painkillers provide effective short-term relief and should make a sore toe much more bearable. Make sure to only take the dosages recommended on the label, and talk to your doctor if you're on any existing medications before taking over-the-counter painkillers.








Keep in mind that cheap generic painkillers work just as well as more expensive name-brand equivalents."

Cut your toenails straight across.,
Keep your toenails at a safe length.,
Protect your toes from injury.,
Wear the right size shoes.",How to Remove an Ingrown Toenail3," One easy, effective way to prevent ingrown nails is to change the way you cut your nails. If you ordinarily cut your nails with a curved or crescent shape, try to start cutting them straight across. This makes it less likely for the nail to grow into the skin and develop into an ingrown nail.







, One of the most common causes of ingrown nails is excessive cutting or clipping. Toenails that are too short can be pressed into the skin of the toe by the pressure that comes from wearing shoes, leading to ingrown situations. Toenails should be clipped so they're even with the tips of your toes. Clipping toenails shorter than this can lead to ingrown nails.








If you have a habit of picking or biting your toenails, this can make it hard to let your toenails grow to the edge of your toes. In this case, you may also want to talk to a doctor, counselor, or therapist about habit reversal training, a psychological technique that can help control bad habits., Another common cause of ingrown toenails is injury. Usually, you injure your toes either from something falling onto the foot or smashing into it from the front. If the toenail is damaged, it may not grow properly and can easily become ingrown. If you spend lots of time in situations where toe injury is a major possibility (like working at construction sites), invest in a sturdy pair of steel-toed boots to lessen the risk of the sorts of injuries that can lead to lasting toe damage.







, If you wear tight shoes that constantly squeeze your toes, this may be the cause of your ingrown toenail.Try switching to a looser-fitting pair of shoes or wearing less-constrictive shoes like slippers around the house to lessen your chance of ingrown nails in the future. If you're very prone to ingrown toenails, you may even want to visit a specialty shoe store for people with foot problems to get a professional's opinion.








Another way to get the same effect is simply to switch to open-toed shoes like sandals and flip flops. These shoes put no pressure at all on the toes, so there's no risk of them causing an ingrown nail.

Try to have 1/2 inch of space between the end of your toe and the shoe when you're standing. The ball of your foot should feel comfortable in the shoe. You should also buy shoes at the end of the day so that your shoes offer enough room for any swelling that happens by the end of the day. If you do occasionally wear high heels, get the shoes professionally fitted so you have the best fit possible and avoid wearing heels over 2 inches high.;
, See a podiatrist (a doctor who specializes in feet) to get a prescription for orthotic supports. These orthotic supports are basically shoe inserts that are specifically designed for your feet. They prevent hammer toes or slow the progression of the condition.You should also use silicone or moleskin padding on any sore or tender toes when you are wearing shoes. These can reduce friction and prevent irritation.

, If you have corns or calluses, painful areas of hardened tissue, use a pumice stone.Soften the corn or callus in warm water. Take the pumice stone and rub over the hardened tissue to wear it down. Apply a moisturizer to the corn or callus to keep it soft.Avoid rubbing the corn or callus with the pumice stone to the point where you draw blood or go below the level of the skin.

, Strengthen the muscles of your feet to prevent developing a hammer toe. Do exercises that stretch, bend and splay the toes all together. You should also move each toe individually and massage them as you stretch. Practice curling and releasing each toe.Consider using toe separators at night to help keep your muscles stretched.

, Since hammer toes are usually caused by muscle and tendon imbalance in your feet and toes, these often develop over time. Age, trauma, and family history can increase your risk for developing hammer toe. Hammer toes often run in families and are more common in women than in men.Tight shoes and arthritis can both make hammer toes worse.

, You may notice corns or calluses on the toes that develop hammer toe. If you have hammer toe, you'll feel pain, especially when you wear shoes that constrict your toes. Other symptoms include:Inflammation, redness and tenderness
Open sores
Involuntary bending of the toes (contracture)

, Shoes are one of the biggest factors in developing hammer toes that you can control. If you frequently wear high heels, shoes that are too small, or shoes that don't give your toes enough space, you are more likely to get hammer toes. Other conditions can cause hammer toes, such as:Genes that cause flat feet or high arches
Neuromuscular diseases like diabetes which can put additional pressure on your toes

, If you have any foot pain or symptoms of hammer toe, see a foot specialist (podiatrist). This is especially important if your toes bend involuntarily. Early treatment could prevent the need for surgery.The podiatrist will physically examine your foot, although an x-ray or other imaging may be needed to make a diagnosis.

, Wear protective padding for painful corns and calluses to protect your toes from further irritation. You can also get over-the-counter non-medicated pads. Your podiatrist might prescribe custom foot inserts (orthotic devices) that you place in your shoes. These can maintain your muscles and tendons.


Ask your podiatrist if you should use splints or straps to straighten out your hammer toe., If the skin around your hammer toe becomes red or inflamed, or if it feels painful to stand on, apply an ice pack. An ice pack can numb the pain and reduce swelling. Apply the ice pack several times throughout the day or whenever you notice swelling.Never apply ice directly to your toes. This can damage the skin tissue. Instead, be sure to wrap the ice in a cloth before applying it to your toes.

, If you're experiencing severe inflammation and pain, you may need corticosteroid injection therapy. These injections can reduce inflammation and manage pain. Injections are often used if you have arthritis and hammer toe.If your pain is moderate, you may be able to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen to manage pain.

, If your toes don't respond to other treatments, the podiatrist might suggest surgery to treat the hammer toe. The surgeon will give you a local anesthetic and will realign and readjust the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments in your toe. Screws, wires, and plates may hold the corrected toe in place while you heal.Most surgeries for hammer toe take a few hours. You'll need someone to drive you home and you should plan to stay off of your foot for several days.

Walk straight lines heel-to-toe.",How to Quickly Regain Your Balance," Unless you get knocked off your feet by a very strong force, you will likely still have one foot on the ground when you begin to fall. If possible, bring your airborne foot to the ground as quickly as possible. It is much easier to stabilize yourself on two feet than one.


This might not be enough to save you from falling in situations where the ground is slippery (say, an icy sidewalk) or the ground is uneven or sloped.
You are better off planting your foot a fair distance (12 inches or more) away from your other foot. A wider stance provides more stability.
Plant your airborne foot in the direction you are falling. If your center of gravity is moving forward, but you plant your foot behind you, this won't improve your balance. This may not be possible in sideways falls where your airborne foot is on the opposite side as the direction of your fall.;
, Once you have two feet on the ground, bend at the knees and hips to lower your body toward the ground. This will lower your center of gravity, making it easier to stabilize yourself. This also uses your legs as shock absorbers to soften the impact to your joints of stumbling or falling.


Make a conscious effort to bend at your waist and lean your torso opposite to the direction you are falling. This will further adjust your center of gravity and stabilize you. Just be sure not to overcompensate, as this could make you fall the other way.
This step is most effective on flat ground, where you are most likely to be able to squat down quickly without hurting your knees.
If you are a taller person, you may need to squat lower than someone who is shorter, as your center of gravity is naturally higher off the ground.

, Most people instinctively reach out when falling off balance to either grab a nearby object or counter-balance themselves against the direction of the fall. Sticking out your arms away from the direction your body is moving will help quickly offset your shifting center of mass. This way, you are fighting your body's tendency to let its mass be pulled down by gravity.


Keep in mind that anything you might be holding onto when you lose your balance could end up going flying when you thrust out your arms. If possible, hold onto it for even greater counter-balancing potential. You'll need all the help you can get!
This action is what gives falling people their signature flailing appearance, and you'll probably agree that it doesn't exactly look graceful. Nevertheless, it's better than the alternative.

, As mentioned above, your natural tendency when falling will be to reach out and catch yourself on something. Go with this. If you can get a hand on something stable enough to support you while you regain your balance, you are much more likely not to fall. You will, however, have to be lucky enough to be within reach of something when you begin to fall.


Walls, trees, railings, fences, parked cars, and even other people are good examples of things sturdy enough to catch yourself on. Just be aware that another person might go down with you instead.
Some things may seem stable enough to hold onto but may tip over once pulled or pushed on with force. This is usually not something you have time to evaluate when falling, but it is worth being aware of.
This is another action that could carry the consequence of accidentally throwing or crushing whatever you're holding at the time, as your natural reflex will cause you to rapidly extend your arm while opening your reaching hand.

, Unfortunately, you will not always be standing on flat, smooth ground when losing your balance. If you are on stairs, boulders, or some other uneven surface when you begin to fall, you will need to adjust your balance-recovery strategy. Here are a few things to consider:


Plant your feet on surfaces or objects that are as even with one another as possible. This will keep you from pulling yourself off balance even more while trying to plant your feet. If this is not possible, bend your knees and hips to counteract the different ground heights you're standing on.
In some cases, it might be best to transfer your landing into a jog or run instead of a stationary position. This is likely to be a good option if you lose your balance while on unstable ground (like a rocky hillside) or when your body is already moving with some momentum.
If you are slowly losing your balance, evaluate whether your landing will be more stable or safer by jumping as you fall. This way you can have a little extra time to reset your center of mass and land on two feet in a more or less vertical position. This is also useful in the event that you are near flat ground but not standing on it when you begin to fall.

, In some cases, being thrown off balance can be kept from turning into an actual fall by having on footwear suited to your activity. This is especially likely to prevent slips. If you are involved in an activity that puts you at greater risk of losing balance, chances are there is a shoe designed specifically for it that will improve your stability as much as possible.


Obviously, not all falls occur during risky activities. You should not design your wardrobe or life around the relatively small chance that you could lose your balance at some point. Just be smart about your footwear when the situation calls for it. For example, don't wear sandals while walking on ice.
Choose footwear that is not likely to actually cause a fall. Many loose-fitting shoes (including flip-flops and most other sandals) could cause you to lose your balance if they come off at an inopportune moment. Again, just don't wear loose shoes while playing sports or doing anything else that elevates your risk of falling.

, A lot of falls occur when the person simply isn't looking where they're going. Minimize your risk by watching your step, especially in slippery or dimly-lit conditions. Being generally aware of your surroundings is good advice anyway, and will also help you more easily recover your balance if you do stumble.


When walking or moving around at night, use a flashlight or headlamp (if the situation calls for it). Casting light on the ground in front of you will majorly decrease your likelihood of taking a spill.
When walking down stairs, it is an especially good idea to look at the step in front of the one you're currently standing on. If you look at the spot where you intend to step, your brain will do a much better job of telling your foot where to go than if you just settle into a rhythm of bouncing down the steps.

, Sometimes people take medications or consume other substances that decrease their ability to maintain balance. If you are under the influence of alcohol or medications that cause instability and reduce reaction times, your best bet for reducing your chance of a fall is to minimize your movement, especially if you are by yourself.


This doesn't mean you need to sit in a padded recliner if you have had a few drinks, but try to avoid walking long distances or participating in activities that involve lots of moving around on two feet.
Use extra caution when walking down stairs. This can be particularly dangerous if you have impaired balance.

, Almost all staircases and other inclined pathways (such as ramps) have handrails along their lengths, often bolted to a wall or other sturdy structure -- and for good reason. Hold onto these when moving down (or up) a steeply inclined path so you have an automatic safety net if you start to lose your balance. Gravity quickly takes over if you fall on stairs; don't let it win!


Slide your hand along the railing as you move down the stairway instead of taking it off completely. This minimizes the likelihood that you could fall while repositioning your hand.
Check that the railing feels secure. If your railing is not stable or well-attached, it won't do you much good if you use it to catch yourself. If it is not secure, use the one on the other side. If this is not an option, proceed cautiously.

, If you do fall all the way to the ground, protect your face and head above all else by covering them with your hands/arms. You should do this even if it means you could sustain an injury to another body part in the process. Head injuries can be very dangerous or fatal, so keep your head off the ground and away from any other hard, immobile objects.


When falling forward, bring your hands in front of your face. This can serve the dual purpose of helping you catch yourself and protecting your face at the same time.
When falling backward, put your hands behind your head and bend at the waist. This is the best way to keep your head off the ground and cushion the impact if you do make contact.

, In some cases, moving quickly to avoid falling could be almost as likely to cause injury as the fall itself. This is often the case for elderly people or those with pre-existing injuries. If you are likely to throw out your back by contorting to maintain your balance, there's a chance you're better off taking the fall and walking away with some minor scrapes and bruises instead.


Much of your movement while losing balance is a reflex to the situation. As such, you might not be able to avoid a quick body adjustment, even if you are trying to avoid it.
If you do have to allow yourself to fall to avoid a potentially more serious injury, try to land in a way that avoids sensitive areas or older injuries. For example, if you have a torn knee ligament that isn't quite healed, you might not want to plant that foot and should avoid hitting the ground with that knee by turning your injured body part away from the ground as you fall.

, If you fall forward to the ground, allow your arms to compress somewhat once your hands or forearms make contact. Think of this as doing a reverse push-up, where you are applying resistance to your arms but allowing them to flex to absorb the impact. This can help prevent arm bone fractures and will generally soften your landing.


Any time you catch yourself with your hands or arms during a fall, there is a chance you could break a bone in your arm, hand, or wrist. While this is a risk nobody wants to take, it very well could be your best option to avoid more serious injury.
Your risk of breaking a bone is higher if you brace your fall at an awkward angle, such as behind you while falling backward. This is because your arms are not suited to hard impacts while extended behind you, and your joints don't easily bend while in that position.
The stronger you are in your upper body, the more effective this technique will be in helping you keep from being hurt in a fall.

, If you fall to the ground with some momentum (such as if you trip while running or fall off a tall object), you might be able to minimize your risk of injury by letting yourself roll on the ground instead of trying to come to a sudden stop. If you try to do this, just make sure you are protecting your head and neck.


Contact the ground with your hands first, then your upper back/shoulder blade area. Try not to roll past your feet, as this could cause you to land on your face and defeat the purpose of rolling with your fall!
When rolling forward (or end over end), arch your back and duck your head while bending at the waist. The more you can make yourself into a ball shape, the more easily you'll roll.
When rolling onto your side (or barrel-rolling), keep your arms flexed and tucked in, with your hands over your face and your head ducked slightly forward. This will protect your face while keeping the back of your head off the ground.

, To do this, stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly shift your weight from one side to the other, lifting your opposite foot off the ground and holding the position for as long as possible (up to 30 seconds) before switching to the other leg. Repeat this exercise as many times as you feel comfortable.Stand near a stable object or wall if needed so you can grab onto it for stability if you start to fall.
Increase your repetitions to boost the difficulty of this exercise as your balance improves.
Choose a slightly unstable surface to stand on, such as a pillow or a BOSU ball for an even greater challenge.

, To begin this exercise, stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips. While staying upright, raise one foot off the ground and bend your knee so your raised foot is behind you. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds, then switch to the other foot. Repeat this exercise until you've done each foot several times.For an added challenge, you can try reaching your airborne foot to the side or in front of you without touching it to the ground. This forces your balancing muscles to engage as you shift your center of gravity away from your body.
Stand on an unstable surface or attach weights to your ankles to make this exercise more difficult.

, Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and grasping a dumbbell in one hand. Hold the dumbbell so that your elbow is bent at 90 degrees and your palm is facing upward. Lift one leg off the ground and hold that position for up to 30 seconds before repeating on the other side.Increase the difficulty of this exercise by gradually increasing the weight of the dumbbell. You can also try doing full bicep curls instead of keeping your elbow bent at 90 degrees. This will cause your muscles to constantly correct for the shifting weight.
Try variations to this exercise, such as changing which leg you raise off the ground. It will be harder to lift the leg on the same side as the dumbbell, so work up to this if you can't do it when you first start exercising.

, You can work on improving your balance and test how far you've come by practicing walking in a straight line while placing one foot directly in front of the other with the heel of your front foot almost touching the toes of your back foot. Raise your arms to the side and hold them at shoulder height.Keep your eyes focused on a point far in front of you for added stability. Looking at your feet will make it harder to balance.
Increase the difficulty of this exercise by moving very slowly or pausing with one foot in the air during each step.
Turn around at some point along the line you've walked without breaking your posture and go back the other way.

Warm up with cardio exercise.,
Do leg raises.,
Try hamstring curls.,
Do wall squats.,
Try step ups.,
Strengthen your inner and outer thighs.,
Finish with leg stretches.",How to Prevent Sore Knees During Your Workout1," Before you do any stretching or strengthening exercises, you should always warm up with some cardio exercise. Go for a ten minute walk on the treadmill or a ten minute spin on an exercise bike. Take a quick walk or light jog around the block for five to ten minutes. This will help to warm up your muscles and prevent injury.Doing a warm up before your workout can ensure you do not develop sore knees or pulled muscles, as your muscles will be warm and prepared for stretching or strengthening.;
, Leg raises will help to strengthen your quadriceps, the muscles located on the front of your thigh, without aggravating your knees. This is because the exercise is non-weight bearing, meaning it won’t put much strain on the knee joints.To do leg raises, sit down on an exercise mat. Bend your left knee and place your foot flat on the mat. Keep your right leg straight and raise it to the height of the opposite knee.
Repeat the leg raise 10-15 times for three sets, resting for 30 to 60 seconds between each set.

, People with knees issues often have weak hamstrings. Hamstring curls can help to strengthen these muscles on the back of your thighs, thereby helping your knees feel supported and strong. You can do this exercise lying flat on your stomach on an exercise mat.Lie down on your stomach, with your chest on the mat and your hands under your chin or by your sides. Inhale as you raise one leg up and out behind you with your toes flexed. Bring your heels as close to your butt as you can and hold the position. Exhale as you place your leg back on the mat.
Do this exercise 10 to 15 times on one leg and then switch to the other leg. Repeat for 2 to 5 sets.

, Wall squats allow you to strengthen your thighs and your glute muscles while keeping your lower back straight. Maintaining a straight lower back will ensure your knees are well supported and not at risk of injury.To do wall squats, stand with your back against a wall. Place your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Be sure that your feet are also in line with your knees, about a thigh-length away from the wall. You should be able to see the top of your shoes at all times during the exercise.
Slowly bend your knees, keeping your back and pelvis against the wall. Only bend until you feel a slight stretch in your thighs. Do not bend too low, as this can hurt your knees.
Hold the squat for five to ten seconds and then rise back up slowly, keeping your back flat against the wall. Repeat this exercise 10-15 times for a set, working up to 2 to 3 sets.

, Step ups are a great exercise for strengthening your leg muscles and to get your heart rate going. You can do step ups using a low exercise bench, a low platform, or the lowest step on a staircase.Place one foot on the step with your pelvis level. Bend your knee and slowly lower your other foot on the floor. Touch your toe to the floor and then raise it back up.
Repeat these movements 10-15 times on the same side. Then, switch legs. Make sure you inhale and exhale with each step.

, Strengthening your thighs is good because the thighs control the inward and outward motion of the knee during movement. Working these muscle groups may help keep your knees better aligned.

An inner thigh exercise can help prevent your knees from splaying outward. To work this area, stand about a forearm’s distance away from a sturdy chair or counter-top, holding it with your right hand. Position your feet hip-distance apart with your toes facing forward.
Then, place a soft ball or pillow between your thighs. Lift your heels, stand on the balls of your feet, and slightly lower your knees about an inch while pressing your inner thighs on the ball. Hold for a few seconds and then raise yourself and bring your left arm overhead. Repeat for reps before switching sides.
Try a standing side leg raise to work your outer thigh muscles. These help to prevent the knees from collapsing toward each other (knock knees). To do a standing side leg raise, stand next to a chair that you can hold for support. Stand on one leg – this is your starting position.
Keeping your leg straight, slowly raise it out to the side as far as you can and then swing it back down, crossing the opposite leg. Repeat this movement 5 to 10 times, increasing the range of motion as you do. Switch to the other side.

, Once you have done several leg strengthening exercises, you should always finish with leg stretches. Stretching your legs after doing a leg workout can help ensure your muscles do not tighten – tightness that can contribute to knee pain.Do a butterfly stretch. Sit on an exercise mat with the bottoms of your feet pressed together. Your legs should form a diamond shape. Hold your feet with your hands and inhale. Exhale as you slowly lean your upper body forward, keeping your lower back straight. Hold the stretch for up to one minute.
Try a hamstring stretch. Place your leg on the lowest step on a stairwell or on the curb of a sidewalk. Then, stretch your opposite arm toward your knee or your ankle. Hold the stretch for 20 to 60 seconds and then repeat it with the other leg.
You can also do hip flexor stretches. Lie on your back with arms at your sides, your feet on the floor, and knees bent. Your fingers should almost touch your heels. Then, press your heels down and lift your body up at the hips. Hold this for a few seconds and return to the resting position. Repeat a few times.
Finish with an IT band stretch. This targets the ligament along the side of your knee. To stretch the IT band, cross your right leg over the left while standing and lean to the right (toward the back leg) till you feel a stretch on the side of your left leg. Hold for about 20 to 60 seconds and repeat 2 or 3 times, then switch sides.

Avoid overtraining.",How to Prevent Ankle Injuries1," Although it may seem like a small detail, your choice of shoes can have a huge impact on your ankles and feet when doing any kind of exercise. Buying and wearing the right type of shoe for your foot will go a long way in preventing injury to your ankles. Keep some of the following tips in mind when shopping for your next pair of shoes:If you have low arches you will need a shoe that provides front and arch support.
Softer platforms and more cushion can be a good fit if you have high arches or stiff feet.
Cross training shoes can work for multiple styles of sports.
It's best to buy and wear a shoe that is specifically designed for your favorite sport. For example, buying actual running shoes for running, basketball shoes for playing ball, etc.;
, Over time your shoes will wear down, changing the way they support your foot. This changing support can affect how your foot falls when walking or running and increase the chances of you sustaining an ankle injury. Always replace your shoes to make sure they are supporting your foot properly.Generally, shoes should be replaced every six months.
If you run more often, replacing your shoes more frequently can be a good idea.
Check your shoes for obvious signs such as a crushed inner platform or any tears or rips.

, If you are a fan of walking or running exercise, you will want to pay attention the surfaces you are traveling on. Unleveled or uneven surfaces can pose a the danger of injuring your ankle. If your foot falls on an uneven surface it can twist and sprain the ankle. Always make sure your planned routes have level and safe surfaces for you to run or walk on. Roots, gravel, rocks, and holes can all present hazards and increase the chances of injuring your ankle.
Be careful when running up or down hills, as this can increase your chances of injury.Gradually add more hills to your running routes to protect yourself.

, Getting in regular exercise or physical activity can be a great idea for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, it is possible that you can get too much exercise. Overtraining will increase the chances of injury and make it more likely that you may hurt your ankle. Avoid training too much to keep your ankle safe.Try cross-training to avoid injury brought on by repetitive motion and exercise.
For example, if you are a runner you might try weight lifting, bike riding, or even walking to reduce repetitive strain and still improve your running capabilities.Take time off if you notice any pain or soreness in your ankle.

Wear shoes made of materials that will deter foot odor.,
Try not to wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row.,
Put on clean socks.,
Wear socks with close-toed shoes.This will help to wick moisture away from your feet, but keep most of it from being absorbed by your shoes and eventually causing odor.

,
Try medicated insoles.",How to Prevent Foot Odor1," Plastic and nylon shoes make it hard for your feet to ventilate, and can worsen odor. Choosing footwear made of leather, canvas, mesh and other breathable materials will help prevent odor.Wearing open-toed shoes in the summer (when it can be especially hot and/or humid) and going barefoot when at home will also help prevent foot odor.;
, This will allow your shoes more time to dry out before wearing them again. You can also remove the insoles from your shoes (if applicable) to speed the drying process.You can also try drying your shoes in the sun. Keeping your shoes dry helps to reduce odor-causing bacteria. Time spent in the sunshine and fresh air can speed the drying process and may deodorize your shoes.You can speed up drying time for the shoes by stuffing them with old newspaper which will absorb the moisture quicker than letting shoes to simply air dry.
If you cannot rid your shoes of odor, discard them and replace them with fresh ones.

, Wearing a fresh pair of clean socks every day will keep moisture, bacteria, and odor at bay. If you sweat excessively, changing your socks even more frequently will help reduce odor.
Wearing padded socks will provide additional material to wick moisture away from your foot, and thus control odor.
Cotton or wool socks are best, rather than nylon or other synthetic fibers.

,, These are made of various materials that have a deodorizing effect and which wick moisture away from the feet. Since the insoles of shoes normally absorb a lot of odor-causing sweat, these products are a great choice to control odor.Medicated insoles can be purchased over the counter at pharmacies and department stores.
Simply remove the standard insoles of your shoes and replace them with the medicated insoles.

Do not lock out your knees.,
Make sure your knee never goes past your ankle.,
Wear supportive exercise shoes.,
Stop the exercise if you feel shooting pains in your knee.",How to Prevent Sore Knees During Your Workout2," For those with knee problems, you should keep a small bend in the knee when you do leg exercises. Never lock out your knee or make it completely straight, as this can injure the joint. Instead, keep a slight bend in your knees, even when you are doing leg raises.You may practice your form in these exercises before you do them in a workout so you can get used to keeping your knees slightly bent.

, You should also check that your knee sits at a 90 degree angle when you are doing lunges, squats, or any other bent leg exercises. Your knee should never go past your ankle, as this can lead to injury.You may try doing leg exercises in front of a mirror to make sure your knee does not go past your ankle.

, A big contributing factor to sore knees is improper exercise shoes. Make sure your exercise shoes are supportive and fit you properly. You may try on several pairs of running shoes in store to make sure your knees feel supported and that your feet are properly protected when you wear the shoes.You may ask a salesperson to professionally fit you for running shoes so they are safe for you to wear when working out.
You may also avoid wearing shoes that do not offer proper support, even when you are not working out or at the gym. Opt for supportive shoes.

, If you feel any shooting pains in your knees or intense throbbing in your knees when you are working out, stop doing the exercise. This is a sign that you are not doing the exercise correctly or that your knee issue is severe.You may check to make sure you are not locking your knee or letting your knee extend past your ankle when you workout. These habits can lead to knee pain.
If the soreness in your knees is persistent or chronic, you may need to see your doctor to get your knee joints professionally examined and treated.

Commit to a weekly workout routine.,
Treat your knees at home.,
Follow a healthy diet.,
Take an exercise class.",How to Prevent Sore Knees During Your Workout3," Sore knees can also be caused by weight gain, as your body has to support more weight and this can lead to pain in your joints. You should try to follow a healthy lifestyle to prevent sore knees and other health issues. Commit to a weekly workout routine and stick to it so you can be healthy and at a fit weight.You may create a schedule for your workouts so you never miss one. This could be a weekly schedule, with time set aside specially for working out.

, Some basic first aid and home care can help you manage your knees, reducing soreness and inflammation and chance of injury. This can include rest, cold, compression, or over-the-counter meds.Rest sore knees. Take a few days off from your normal activity to avoid putting too much strain on the joints. Give your knees time to heal.
Apply ice. Cold will reduce pain and inflammation, so try putting a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel over your knees. Just be careful – don’t put the ice directly on your skin and don’t keep it on for more than 20 minutes at a time. Longer than that can damage nerves and skin.
Use a compression bandage. Look for compression bandages at your local drugstore. These fit right over the knee and help to control fluid buildup. They might also give you better knee alignment and stability.
Elevate. For soreness and swelling, try propping your injured leg up on a pillow or cushion. Gravity will help keep the swelling down.
Over-the-counter meds like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can also help manage pain. Some people find relief with numbing creams such as lidocaine, too.

, As part of a healthy lifestyle, you should also follow a healthy diet. This means having balanced meals that consist of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein. You should try to prepare healthy meals at home, as eating out can lead to poor food choices and meals lacking in vitamins and nutrients., To maintain a healthy lifestyle, you may trying taking an exercise class at your local gym or community center. You may look for a class that focuses on strengthening your leg muscles, as this can help to improve the health of your knee joints.You may also try taking up swimming or water aerobics. Doing exercises in water can lessen the weight your knees have to bear when you are moving, making you less prone to sore knees.

Prepare a warm foot bath.,
Soak your foot and affected toe.,
Massage your toe in the bath.,
Dry your entire foot thoroughly.,
Apply antibiotic cream.,
Slip some cotton or dental floss under the toenail.,
Trim the toenail properly.,
Determine the cause of the pain.,
Look for signs of infection.,
Rule out other common causes of toe pain.",How to Soak an Ingrown Toenail," The purpose of soaking your affected toe/foot in a warm bath is essentially two-fold: to reduce the discomfort and to soften the toenail in efforts to either trim it or put something under it to relieve the pressure.Grab a container that's big enough for your entire foot and fill it with very warm water. Consider adding some Epsom salt, as it can significantly reduce pain and swelling.The magnesium in the salt will also help the foot muscles relax.


Salt acts as a natural antibacterial, but other ingredients you can add to the water to deter a potential infection include white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, bleach, and iodine solution.
The warmer you make a salt bath, the more fluid you'll pull out of your toe, which is good for reducing the swelling.
If you can find on, borrow or buy a little foot jacuzzi, then use that for the bath because the jets will provide better water circulation and a gentle foot massage.;
, Once you have the bath water warm enough and you've added Epsom salt and/or any natural antiseptic compounds, submerge you entire foot and let it soak for about 15–20 minutes.Depending on results, you can repeat the foot bath three to five times daily, so don't throw out the water if that's your plan. If you use Epsom salt, you'll notice that your feet look quite ""pruned"" after 20 minutes — it's a sign fluid was sucked out of your feet/toes.


Flexing your toes repeatedly while in the bath will help with blood circulation.
If swelling is a particular problem in your toe, then follow the warm salt bath with cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel) until your toe feels numb (about 10 minutes). Ice helps reduce acute inflammation and dull the pain.

, While your toe is soaking in the warm bath, periodically massage the inflamed tissue gently in order to help reduce the inflammation.With the massage, you might notice a little pus or blood release from your toe into the water, which is fine, and it will likely reduce the pressure and pain in your toe.


Use your thumb and forefinger to lightly massage the most inflamed part of your toe, starting from the most distal part and pushing towards your ankle.
Spend only about five minutes or so of the bath time massaging your toe, as much longer might actually irritate it.

, Once you're finished with the warm foot bath and remove your foot from it, make sure to thoroughly dry it with a clean towel.Keeping your toe dry is important because bacteria and other potential pathogens, such as fungus, prefer moist, warm conditions in which they can flourish and reproduce.


After you've dried your toe/foot, elevate your leg on a few cushions while you sit in order to promote blood drainage out of your foot, which helps combat inflammation.

, Over the course of a day, apply antibiotic cream, lotion or ointment to your affected toe at least a couple of times, particularly just before you go to bed in the evening.After the cream has absorbed into the soft tissue surrounding the inflamed toe, apply a sanitized bandage. Make sure to change the bandage each time you apply antibiotic.


Some compounds around the house that have antibiotic properties include Clorox bleach, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, baking soda dissolved in water, iodine solution and fresh lemon juice.
Be warned that most home remedies that act as antiseptics will sting if the skin has already been cut by a sharp ingrown toenail.
Colloidal silver is a powerful antibiotic, antiviral, and anti-fungal that doesn't sting or irritate the skin when applied. It can be found at most health food or nutritional supplement stores.

, After soaking your foot in the warm bath, the ingrown toenail will soften up and allow you to slip a small piece of cotton, gauze, or bunched up dental floss (clean of course) underneath the nail, which will provide some padding for the sensitive soft tissue near the nail bed.Carefully pull back the inflamed skin and lift up the toenail with a nail file, or something similar, and tenderly push the cotton material underneath it. Change the cotton material daily.


It may take one to two weeks for the ingrown toenail to grow enough so that it doesn't poke into the skin any longer.
Avoid attempting “do-it-yourself"" surgery by cutting into the toenail in an attempt to provide pain relief, because it can actually cause the condition to worsen.

, Once the toenail has grown and is long enough to clip, then don't make the same mistakes again. Instead, trim the toenail straight across and don't taper the edges or clip them at angles.Also, refrain from cutting them too short as it will further agitate the injured toe.


If you have your toenails done by a pedicurist, tell them to trim your nails straight across and not too close to the skin. As a guideline, you should be able to fit your fingernail under the sides and end of the toenail.If home care and changing your trimming technique doesn't help or prevent your ingrown toenail issue, then see your family physician or a foot specialist (podiatrist) for advice and/or treatment.

, If one of your big toes (or any other toe) gets inflamed and starts to hurt, take off your socks or nylons and take a closer look at it in order to determine the cause of the pain. If the condition develops slowly, getting worse over the course of many days, and you have a history of trimming your toenails short and/or wearing tight or narrow shoes, then you're likely dealing with an ingrown toenail.In most cases, it's easy to see where the toenail is digging into or piercing the soft tissue surrounding the nail bed.


In addition to pain and swelling, other signs to look for include redness and tender to touch, along one or both sides of the nail.
Ingrown toenails are more common in adolescence and among athletes, especially males., The most serious consequence of an ingrown toenail is a bacterial infection stemming from a breach in the skin surrounding the nail bed.An infected ingrown toenail will get even more swollen and tender, quite firm and warm to touch, and eventually discharge pus that smells foul. Because of the warmth and swelling, usually some skin will peel off and look like a blister.


An infection swells because your immune system sends white blood cells to kill any bacteria within the injury (which is good), but sometimes the bacteria proliferate faster than the immune cells can contain them.
If an infected toe doesn't go away within a week and/or seems to be spreading beyond the affected toe, then see your doctor about it. Your doctor may remove the ingrown nail wedge surgically.
If you trim your toenails by tapering the corners such that they're curved with the shape of your toe, you're encouraging the toenail to grow into the skin on the sides.

, There are a number of other painful conditions that appear similar to an ingrown toenail that you should be familiar with. Relevant examples include gout (an inflammatory type of arthritis), bunions (chronic toe sprain leading to deformity), broken or dislocated toes, rheumatoid arthritis, necrosis (tissue death due to lack of blood supply), neuropathy related to diabetes, neuromas (benign tumors in the small nerves of the feet), fungal infection.A gout attack comes on quickly, usually within hours, and creates intense pain and inflammation in the big toe. Gout is dietary related — from eating too many purine-rich foods such as seafood and organ meats.
A bunion also affects the big toe and is caused mainly by wearing narrow shoes over many years. It's essentially a chronic joint sprain. The tell-tale signs are a crooked toe and achy, arthritic-like pain.
Stubbing your toe or other foot injuries can trigger ingrown toenails.

Always warm up.,
Slowly work into new activities.,
Don't ignore pain.,
Tape up your ankle.",How to Prevent Ankle Injuries2," Whenever you plan on exercising or doing any heavy physical activity, you will want to properly warm up. Warming up can help prepare your body and ankles for more strenuous work, reducing the likelihood of injuring the area.Light stretching is a good way to warm up.
Slowly jogging can safely bring up your heart rate and engage your ankles before exercising.
Don't force any stretch. Keep your motions slow and stop if you feel discomfort.

, If you plan on starting new exercises, activities, or increasing the intensity of things you're already doing, you will need to work into them slowly. Jumping into a new movement or intensity too hard, too quickly will greatly increase the chances of you sustaining an ankle injury.Gradually build up to new exercise programs over the course of a few weeks.
You can also use cross-training methods to build strength and keep you protected from injury.
For example, try running only one mile if you are new to running. If you felt comfortable running that much, add a bit more distance next time. Once you get used to that new distance, you can add more and continue building up your run length in this way.

, The simplest way to avoid injury to your ankle is to listen to what your body is saying. If you notice any pain at all during exercise or activity, stop immediately or change the motion. Pushing through any kind of joint pain will only further agitate the area and may result in a worse injury. Always listen to your body when exercising for signs of impending injury or pain. Don't train while injured. Allow the area to fully heal before continuing any exercise program.

, If you have an old ankle injury, you also have a greater chance of injuring it again. To cut down on recurrent injuries to your ankle you may want to apply a bandage or tape. The ankle bandage or tape will help reinforce the area and will help keep it from moving in a way that could result in another injury. Use this technique to properly tape your ankle:Apply one strip of tape around the lower shin to create an anchor.
Place another anchor strip around the middle of the foot.
Create a stirrup by placing one end of the tape at your first shin anchor, bringing it under the foot, and back up to the other side of your shin anchor.
Create a “figure 8” shape. Start a piece of tape at the top of your stirrup, either side will do. Bring the tape down, across the shin, under the foot, back up the leg and connect to it the opposite side of your stirrup.
Add another stirrup on the foot itself. Start on one side of the foot anchor tape, bring the tape under the back of the heel and end the tape on the opposite side of the foot you started from.
Repeat each strip once again. However, this time place the strips of tape with just a bit of overlap between them to cover more of the ankle and provide more support.

Get in some ankle circles.,
Try some calf raises.,
Add in shin raises.,
Practice single leg balance.",How to Prevent Ankle Injuries3," Ankle circles are a simple motion that will stretch out the muscles around the ankle and get it ready for exercise. Use the following motions to do a proper ankle circle stretch:Sit down with your legs straight out in front of you.
Place one leg over the other.
Start drawing a circle in the air with your toes using the elevated foot.
Make circles going both clockwise and counter-clockwise.
Switch legs and do the same motion for the other ankle.

, The calf raise is a simple move that can help you learn how to keep your balance while in motion. It can also help build strength in the lower leg which may help prevent injury. Use the following motions to get in a good calf stretch:Stand up straight with your feet at about shoulder width apart.
Shift your weight onto your toes.
Slowly lift your heels off the ground.
Maintain balance as you raise your heels up.
Lower your heels back down before repeating the movement.

, Shin raises will help improve your sense of balance, much like a calf raise. This simple motion can also help you to build strength in your lower leg muscles. Use the following motions to perform a proper calf raise:


Stand straight up and place your feet about shoulder width apart.
Keep your weight in your heels.
Slowly lift your toes up into the air.
Focus on keeping your balance as you lift your toes up.
Lower your toes back down to the ground and repeat the motion.

, An easy exercise you can use to build strength and balance in your legs is to balance on only one leg. Shifting the balance to one leg places your entire body weight on that leg alone. This increase in weight will engage your muscles and sense of balance, improving both. Use the following motions to practice the single leg balancing exercise:


Stand straight up with both feet on the ground.
Pull one foot slightly off the ground and shift your entire weight onto the other leg.
Slightly squat down using your one leg only.
Hold the squat for around 20 to 30 seconds.
Stand back up straight and put your other foot back down.
Repeat the motion on the other leg.

Wash your feet frequently.,
Soak your feet.,
Use foot powders.,
Apply an antibacterial cream.Antibacterial creams designed for use on your feet may help prevent foot odor.,
Use a deodorant or antiperspirant.,
Change your diet.",How to Prevent Foot Odor2," Bathing your feet every day in warm water will help reduce foot odor.Use a mild antibacterial soap.
Dry your feet thoroughly after washing. Don’t forget to dry between your toes.

, A variety of foot soaks can help reduce or prevent foot odors:Make a mixture of one part vinegar to two parts water.Soak your feet in this for thirty minutes at a time as needed.
Soak your feet in strong black tea for thirty minutes a day.Use two regular sized tea bags for each pint of water. Boil for fifteen minutes, and then add two quarts of water to make the tea cool enough to soak your feet in. Soak them for thirty minutes a day for a week. Because it is acidic, the tea will have an antibacterial effect that can reduce foot odor.
Dissolve a handful of kosher salt in warm water and soak your feet in the solution for thirty minutes as needed.No scientific studies conclusively show that salt prevents foot odor. However, it can dry your skin, potentially reducing moisture and thereby odor.
Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a tub of water large enough to place your feet in and soak your feet in the solution.Lemon juice has antibacterial properties, and can help remove dead skin cells. This may help reduce foot odor.

, A variety of medicated foot powders and simple home ingredients can help reduce or prevent foot odors. Take a small amount of your chosen powder and rub it all over your feet. Use a soft cloth to lightly dust off any that cakes up. Common powders used to control foot odor include:Corn starch.
Baking soda.
Baby powder.

, These may be found at pharmacies. Carefully follow all instructions supplied with your cream.

, Spraying your feet with antiperspirant or deodorant will help prevent foot odor. There are specialized foot sprays, but regular underarm deodorant or antiperspirant sprays work just as well.Over-the-counter or prescription roll-on deodorants and antiperspirants may also be effective.

, The foods and drinks you consume can contribute to body odor.If you have a problem with foot odor, it is possible that eliminating certain foods and drinks from your diet can reduce the problem. Common foods, drinks, and spices thought to contribute to body odor include:Caffeinated beverages.
Foods containing sulphur compounds, including onions, garlic, and cauliflower.
Red meat.
Alcohol.
Strong-smelling spices, such as cumin or fenugreek.

Discuss the different aspects of ACL surgery with your physician.,
Make sure that surgery is the only option.,
Set up your house so that you will be able to move around easily after your surgery.,
Stop taking NSAIDs two weeks before your surgery.,
Quit using tobacco products four weeks before your surgery.,
Talk to your doctor one week before your surgery about discontinuing medication used to thin your blood.",How to Prepare for ACL Surgery1," This will help you understand the true nature of your health status and assist you in making an informed decision.


Ask as many questions as possible. Let the physician know of any concern or anything that is unclear to you.
During the ACL surgery, a tendon from other place of your body will be taken and used to surgically reattach the two torn ligaments. This is needed because even surgery cannot simply sew back together the ligament without additional tissue.
The surgery is done with the use of a narrow, fiber-optic viewing scope. The surgeon will create a small incision on the knee. The scope will then guide the placement of the ACL graft.;
, In most cases, surgery is the last option when it comes to ACL injuries. Therefore, you and your physician should have already explored other medical interventions before resorting to surgery.


Remember that not all ACL tears needs surgery. People who have only stretched or partially torn their ACL can recover easily with physical therapy and non-invasive treatments.
Usually, surgery to treat an ACL tear is needed for athletes who need stronger and more stable ligaments to support intense and sudden movements. Surgery of the ACL may also decrease the chance of its recurrence.
There are two cruciate ligaments, the anterior and posterior. Along with these ligaments are the collateral ligaments positioned at the side. When there is more than one ligament injured and other adjacent structures of the knee are affected, then surgery is probably the best option.

, Take a moment to think about your living space. If you need to go up or down stairs to reach your bedroom, make sure that this is okay with your surgeon. Otherwise, you will need to come up with an alternate living arrangement.

, Discontinue your use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). These medicines thin your blood, which can result in complications due to bleeding after or during surgery. In order to reduce your chance of complications, avoid the following medicines:


Aleve (Naproxen)
Advil (Ibuprofen)
Motrin

, If you use tobacco products of any kind, discontinue your tobacco use at least 4 weeks before (and for 8 weeks after) your surgery. This is important because tobacco products negatively affect your body’s ability to heal itself, which could lead to infection.


There are many online resources to help you stop smoking.
Additionally, many commercially available products exist to help, such as patches, nicotine gum, and more.

, You will most likely need to stop taking prescription medicines that are used to thin your blood or prevent blood clots from forming 7-days prior to your surgery. These medicines can cause you to bleed excessively during surgery, and should be avoided.


Consult with your physician to determine if this applies to you.

Wear knee pads.,
Avoid movements that could injure your knees.,
Optimize your weight.,
Eat an anti-inflammatory diet.,
Ask your doctor about medications and other treatments.",How to Prevent Aging Knees1," If you are doing an activity that could cause you to injure your knees, such as a sport that could make you fall, then you should protect them before that happens. Wear knee pads whenever you are doing an activity that may involve a fall or pressure on your knees.


For example, volleyball players should use knee pads to protect their knees when they fall or dive for the ball.Knee pads can be useful for activities beyond sports. For example, if you like to spend a lot of time in your yard weeding, wear knee pads or use a cushioned pad to kneel on when you are on your knees.;
, There are certain kinds of motions that can put a lot of pressure on your knees. Sudden movements or direct pressure on the front or back of the knee can strain and injure the knee. This is especially true if you have an existing injury or illness in the knee, such as osteoarthritis.This means that you should be careful when lifting heavy objects. Be careful that you do not rotate while lifting, as this uses your knee abnormally under extreme pressure.
Also avoid using your knees in a way makes them overextend. For example, be especially careful when exercising that you do not hyperextend your knees.

, Too much weight on knees can age them prematurely. Work on keeping your weight at an optimal level to ensure that your knees do not become painful and damaged.Losing weight helps to limit the stress placed on your knees. If you can limit that stress, your knees are likely to function much better over time.

, For optimum joint health, it is a good idea to eat an anti-inflammatory diet.This diet simply focuses on eating foods that reduce inflammation and avoiding foods that promote inflammation.Foods that reduce inflammation include: fish, green vegetables, olive oil, fruit, and nuts.
Foods that promote inflammation include: fried foods, soda, refined carbohydrates, fat, and processed meats.

, If your knees bother you or if you are concerned about developing problems with them in the future, then talk to your doctor. There are lots of different things that you can do to protect and promote your knee health, and to relieve pain as well. Some options include:Wearing a knee brace to keep your knee properly aligned.
Cortisone injections to reduce pain and inflammation in your knees.
Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Knee surgery to correct severe or ongoing knee pain.

Look between your 3rd, 4th, and 5th toes.,
Look for dry, flaky skin on the bottoms and sides of your feet.,
Be suspicious if you feel itching and burning pain.,
Distinguish between types of blisters.,
Pay attention to toenail changes.,
See your family doctor.,
Get a referral to a medical specialist.,
See a podiatrist.,
Use an over-the-counter anti-fungal preparation.,
Try some home remedies.,
Get a prescription for an anti-fungal drug.",How to Know if You Have Athlete's Foot," These are the most susceptible areas of your foot for fungal infection due to three main factors: they are often neglected when drying the feet; the spaces between toes don't evaporate sweat or moisture very well; they are most prone to abrasion from poorly fitting shoes.If you're itchy in that part of your foot and see some redness, then you might be dealing with a fungal infection.


The primary signs and symptoms of athlete's foot include: a scaly, itchy rash that sometimes leads to stinging or burning pain.
In advanced cases, inflammation and peeling of the skin occur between the toes — a process called maceration.
Athlete's foot is contagious and is easily spread via contaminated floors, towels, socks or flip-flops.;
, As athlete's foot worsens it spreads over the sole of the foot, where it causes dry, flaky skin.It will feel rough to the touch and likely be itchy and somewhat irritated. Initially the area will be small, but it will spread and form an irregular margin.


There are three main varieties of tinea pedis: moccasin type (involves the sole of the feet), inter-digital type (involves the clefts between the toes) and the blistering type (involves the formation of blisters).Athlete's foot is sometimes called ""jungle rot"" by members of the armed forces who serve in humid tropical climates.

, Foot pain, particularly aches and cramps, are common and usually the result of overuse or ill-fitting shoes, but burning pain accompanied by severe, non-stop itching should make you consider athlete's foot. Fungi cause burning and itching because they burrow into the tissue of the foot and use superficial layers as food. As a result, nerve endings become irritated, which provokes itching and leads to burning pain.


Itching is often most intense right after you take off your shoes and socks.Athlete's foot is caused by the same type of fungi that leads to ringworm and jock itch.

, A foot blister can easily be caused by too much walking or running, especially if your shoes don't fit well, but blisters caused by athlete's foot are different — they tend to ooze pus and other fluid and get crusty.Blisters usually form on the thick skin patches, which increases the risk of bacterial infection.


After the fungal blisters erupt, lesions with a red, scaly border grow outward and leave a clear center — this is the classic ringworm appearance found over the skin.
You're at higher risk of athlete's foot if you are male, frequently wear damp socks or tight-fitting shoes, walk barefoot in public areas and/or have weakened immunity., The fungus of athlete's foot often spreads to infect the toenails, which then become discolored, thick and even crumbly.In advanced (chronic) stages of infection, toenails become brittle and may even fall off — a condition known as onycholysis.


Fungus is difficult to eradicate from nail beds because it burrows deep into the tissue.
Burning foot pain and toenail changes are also common with diabetes, so make sure your blood sugar levels are within the normal range.

, There's no point in guessing about your foot ailment, so make an appointment with your physician and tell him/her your observations and suspicions. In some cases, your doctor may be able to diagnose a fungal infection simply by looking at your foot. However, to confirm the diagnosis (and rule out other conditions), he/she might take a skin sample, add a few drops of potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and look at it under a microscope. The KOH dissolves skin, but leaves budding fungi intact, making it easy to see.Alternatively, your doctor may view your feet under black light from a Wood's light, which highlights the presence of fungal infections.Your doctor may also do a gram stain to see if there is an underlying bacterial infection.Your doctor may also take a blood test in order to rule out diabetes and other types of infections (bacterial and viral).

, Medical specialists who deal with skin problems are called dermatologists. A dermatologist is likely to have much more experience than your family physician in dealing with skin conditions, such as infections, rashes and other afflictions. A dermatologist is more likely to be able to do a skin biopsy and KOH preparation under a microscope in their office, so the results can be available in a matter of minutes instead of hours or days.If there is no sign of fungus, then the dermatologist needs to consider other skin conditions that cause a similar appearance such as psoriasis, contact dermatitis, eczema, bacterial infections, gout and venous insufficiency.
Psoriasis can be distinguished by its characteristic silvery white scales, which are usually found in the folds of joints.

, A podiatrist is a foot specialist who also can confirm a diagnosis of athlete's foot and provide treatment. A podiatrist is a also a great source of information on what kinds of shoes and socks to wear to prevent fungal infections from reoccurring.


Occlusive shoe materials, such as vinyl, rubber and plastic, don't allow for sufficient ventilation, which cause feet to remain warm and moist — providing an excellent opportunity for the fungus to proliferate.Switch to shoes with leather insoles instead.
Use cotton socks that absorb water from your feet. Try to avoid socks made with nylon or other synthetic materials.
Try to change your socks every day. Wash them in hot water with baking soda to kill any fungus.

, Over-the-counter anti-fungal powders, creams and/or ointments can help rid you of athlete's foot. The topical drugs that are effective against tinea pedis include azoles, allylamines, ciclopirox, tolnaftate, and amorolfine.Keep using the medicine for a couple of weeks after the infection has cleared to prevent its return, as there may be spores buried in the skin.


Use the powder to disinfect your shoes and save the cream / ointment for your feet, applying it early in the morning and at bedtime.
Fungicidal and fungistatic chemicals used for athlete's foot frequently fail to kill the fungi in the deeper horny layers of the skin, which explains why they're sometimes ineffective., Instead of buying creams from the pharmacy, look in your cupboards for white vinegar (acetic acid). Diluted vinegar (with 75% water) is strong enough to inhibit fungal growth.Soak your feet in diluted vinegar for 10-15 minutes, twice daily, until the itchiness and dryness disappear.


Alternatively, soaking your feet in a drying solution of aluminum acetate (Burow's solution or Domeboro solution) can be effective also.
Clorox bleach can also be effective for killing fungi and most other pathogens, but it may temporarily irritate your skin and nerve endings. Furthermore, try not to inhale it directly as it may cause dizziness, headache or confusion.
Consider an aluminum salt solution, such as aluminum chloride 10% solution or aluminium acetate. These act as antiperspirants by blocking sweat glands. The usual ratio is 1 part solution mixed with 20 parts water (unless a physician instructs otherwise). The solution should be applied to your feet overnight.

, More advanced or resistant cases of athlete's foot may need an oral (pill) anti-fungal such as terbinafine (Lamisil), itraconazole (Sporanox) or fluconazole (Diflucan).Potent oral medications are reserved for people who don't respond to powders, creams, sprays or ointments. Pills may need to be taken for up to a month or so.


Blood tests may be needed before you take these medications to make sure your liver can tolerate them.
Treatment for nail fungus may be more intensive and require longer courses (three to four months) of oral medications.
Fluconazole 50 mg once daily for 4-6 weeks is adequate to clear most fungal infections.
Itraconazole 100 mg once daily for 15 days may be a better alternative.

Understand that exercising your ACL will help to speed up your recovery after surgery.,
Perform the heel dig bridge exercise.,
Try glute sets.,
Perform hamstring curls.,
Give heel raises a try.,
Try the straight leg raise exercise.,
Adduct your hip to gain strength.,
Strengthen your calves with calf raises.,
Ice and wrap your knee after exercising to manage swelling.,
Use crutches or braces if required by your doctor.",How to Prepare for ACL Surgery2," Surgery is usually scheduled in advance to give you enough time to prepare and work on an exercise routine. Exercising prior to surgery will restore some of your knee function and will ensure that your knee will be strong enough for the surgery.


The main objectives of exercising the ACL are to strengthen the supporting muscles and to improve your range of motion as much as possible.
The intensity of the exercise should be gradually increased. Be alert of pain which may signal that you are pushing yourself too much.
When pain is felt, stop the exercise immediately and decrease the intensity of the exercise.
Your physician might refer you to a physical therapist who will develop an exercise program especially tailored to your current condition.
Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise regimens.

, This exercise will help strengthen your hamstring, gluteus (butt muscles), and hip muscles. Perform 3 sets of 12 repetitions of this exercise.


Lie on your back with your hands interlaced on your stomach. Your knees and ankles should be bent in such a way that only your heels are in contact with the floor.
Tighten your abdominal muscles and lift your buttocks and hips up off the floor until your knees, hips, and shoulders are all in line.
Hold this position for 6 seconds and then slowly go back to the starting position and rest for 10 seconds.
Repeat the whole exercise.

, This exercise will strengthen your gluteus muscles, which are important when extending and rotating your legs. Do 3 sets of 12 repetitions.


Lie on your back with your knees straightened and ankles at a 90 degree angle perpendicular to the floor.
Use your elbow to raise your upper body.
Squeeze your buttocks as strongly as possible and hold for 6 seconds. Relax for 10 seconds and repeat the whole procedure.

, This exercise will develop the muscles at the back of your thigh. Do 3 sets of 12 repetitions.


Lie on your stomach with your hands folded to support your head.

You can place a washcloth above your knee if your kneecap feels painful or uncomfortable.


Bend the injured knee towards your hamstring.
Swing down your injured knee back to the starting position in a free-fall, but as the leg is about to hit the floor, “catch” it. Then continue bringing it down again.
Perform the same procedure until desired number of repetitions is achieved.

, This exercise will improve the strength of your calf muscles. Perform 3 sets of 12 repetitions.


Stand behind a backrest of a chair and hold it to gain support.

Your feet should be a 6 inches apart.


Slowly raise your heels off the floor. Keep the knees straight. Hold for 6 seconds and then slowly return to the starting position.

, Straight leg raises will strengthen your quadriceps muscles.


Sit on the floor/mat with your legs straight out in front of you.
Lift your shoulders, using your forearms to maintain this position.
Tighten the thigh muscle on the leg of your injured knee.
Keep your thigh tight and knee straight while you lift your leg 3 to 5 cm off the floor/mat.
Perform this exercise on each leg 5 to 10 times.
Hold each contraction for 5 seconds.
In time, you should be able to progress to 30 reps on each leg holding each contraction for 10 seconds.

, Performing hip adductions will strengthen your hip muscles and increase stability.


Lie down on the floor/mat with your legs bent.
Place a pillow between your knees.
Squeeze your knees together.
Hold this position for 5 seconds.
Rest for 5 seconds.
Repeat 5 to 10 times.
As you become stronger, increase your reps and your time progressing to 30 times and holding each rep for 10 to 15 seconds.

, Calf raises will build the muscles in the lower part of your legs and enable you to support your legs properly.


Stand facing a wall.
Place your feet shoulder width apart.
Point your toes straight ahead.
Lift your heels so you are standing on your toes.
Begin with a set of 10, holding each lift for 5 seconds.

, Manage any swelling with elevation, ice packs and a wrap (ace bandage). If you notice that your knee swells more or your knee pain increases following exercise, bring the swelling down by wrapping your knee in an ace bandage, elevating it and using ice.


Ice packs can remain on your knee for 15 to 20 minutes.
Make sure you have a barrier between your skin and the ice; otherwise, you could damage your tissues.
You can use ice on your knee once every hour.
Bringing the swelling down will ultimately decrease your pain level.
Rest your knee and contact your physiotherapist or surgeon before resuming your exercise routine.

, If your surgeon instructs you to do so, use your brace or crutches to get around. Avoid limping around and further aggravating your knee.

"
"
Stop eating and drinking by 12 am the night before your surgery.,
Arrange for someone to drive you home after your surgery.,
Wear your glasses and leave unnecessary items at home.,
Bring the necessary paperwork to the hospital.",How to Prepare for ACL Surgery3," Typically, you will be instructed to fast for at least 12 hours prior to your appointed hour of surgery. Fasting will reduce the chances of nausea or throwing up during surgery, which can be triggered by some types of anesthesia.


Fasting includes gum, mints, and other small items.
You can brush your teeth; just do not swallow any of the water or toothpaste.

, You will be discouraged from driving home after the surgery, due to residual effects of the anesthesia. Arrange a driver so you can get home after you are discharged without any delay.


Your driver can also help you get your medications from the pharmacy on the way home.

, Try to avoid placing anything on your body that could inadvertently interfere with the surgical procedure. This includes jewelry, makeup, perfume, cologne, lotions, etc. Also, wear glasses instead of contacts, as your eyes may be dried out during the surgery.

, To expedite the process of registration and make sure you are ready for surgery on time, make sure to bring the required items. Bringing these items and having them on hand will save you time digging through your bags or returning home to get them. Bring:


A photo ID (driver’s license or state identification card).
Your health insurance card.
A form of payment if another arrangement has not already been made.
A list of the medications you are taking, the dosage and time of the day that you take them.
You should also bring a list of the medications you are allergic or have had a reaction to.
Walker or crutches, if necessary.
Bring a case for your glasses, dentures and hearing aid, if applicable. All of these items will be removed prior to surgery.

Warm up before exercising.,
Perform targeted weight training.,
Increase knee flexibility.,
Be careful with high-impact exercise.",How to Prevent Aging Knees2," A good warm will get your knees ready for activity and will reduce the chance of injury. To warm up your knees properly, do stretches on the muscles of your thighs. These stretches will get your knees warmed up as well.For example, some good knee warmups include quad stretches, walking lunges, and hamstring stretches.

, By strengthening the muscles that surround your knees, you may improve the function of your joints and reduce the pressure on them as well. Some muscles to target in your routine include:Quadriceps. These are the muscles in the front of your thigh. You can target these with lunges and leg extensions.

Hamstrings. These muscles are in the back of your thighs. You can target these muscles with leg curls and squats.

Abductors. These are on the outer part of your thigh. You can target these with side-lying leg raises or by using an abductor machine at the gym.

Adductors. These are using the muscles on the inside of your thighs. You can target these muscles by holding an exercise ball between your feet with your legs in the air or by using an adductor machine at the gym.

Gluteals. These are your buttock muscles. You can strengthen these by doing squats, lunges, and donkey kicks.

, The right kinds of exercise can help with flexibility in your knees, preventing age related wear and tear. In order to keep your knees from aging prematurely you should spend some workout time focusing on flexibility. Low impact exercises, such as swimming and yoga, can be great for keeping your knees in great shape over time.As you get older, your joints can lose flexibility. Continuing to stretch them on a regular basis can help you avoid this loss.

, While you should be exercising your knees, some exercises can do more damage than good if not done properly. In particular, running and other high-impact activities, such as those that require excessive jumping, can exert a lot of pressure on your knees.To limit this impact, do these types of exercise on soft surfaces or wear well-cushioned and well-fitting shoes. Whatever you can do to limit the impact of high impact exercise is a good idea.


Try to exercise in ways that will put less pressure on your joints, such as swimming, biking, or using an elliptical walker on low or no resistance.
There is some evidence that running may actually be good for your knees. Recent scientific studies show that runners are less likely to have knee problems than non-runners but this may be related to the fact that runners are also more likely to be carrying less weight on their bodies than non-runners."
"
Use skin treatments.,
Work on targeted exercises.,
Use slow weight loss techniques.,
Consider cosmetic surgery.",How to Prevent Aging Knees3," There are a variety of skin treatments that can be used to promote smooth and tight skin on the knees. These include acid treatments to remove dead and damaged skin, as well as moisturizing treatments to keep skin soft and elastic over time.An alpha hydroxy acid treatment can be very effective in getting rid of old and dried up skin on the knees and elbows. There are a variety of these products available over the counter and they should be applied as the packaging directs.

, Exercising the muscles in your legs can increase the skin tension all over your legs. With increased muscle mass, your skin will be better supported and the areas around your knees should firm up.For example, focus some time during your daily workout on exercising your quadriceps. Pumping up these muscles, located directly above your knees, should tighten up the skin on your knee as well.

, Losing a large amount of weight at one time can create a lot of saggy skin all over your body. This sagginess can even affect the look of your knees.Instead of going on a crash diet, focus on losing a pound or two per week, so that your skin has a chance to catch up and tighten on its own.
However, if you are losing a dramatic amount of weight, there may be too much skin for your body to absorb. In cases such as this, the extra skin will not necessarily tighten on its own.

, If you are concerned about the look of your knees then surgery is an option. Plastic surgeons use liposuction and lasers to reduce the amount of loose skin and fat on your knee, leading to tighter skin in the area.Unlike the other options for preventing aging knees, plastic surgery does present some health risks to you. Discuss the possible risks from anesthesia and surgery with your doctor before getting this medical procedure.

Assess your risk factors.,
Recognize the symptoms of arthritis of the knee.,
Keep track of pain.,
Evaluate the range of motion and stiffness.,
Watch for swelling or creaking.,
Note any changes or worsening of symptoms.,
Seek medical advice.",How to Know if You Have Arthritis in the Knee1," Depending on the type of arthritis, there are several factors that may make you prone to arthritis of the knee. Although some of these factors are non-modifiable, there are others you can change to reduce your risk of knee arthritis.Genes. Your genetic background can make you more susceptible to certain types of arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus). If you have a family history of arthritis, you may have a higher risk of developing knee arthritis.Gender. Men are more likely to have gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis resulting from high levels of uric acid in the blood, while women are more likely to develop rheumatic arthritis.Age. You are at a higher risk of developing arthritis as you grow older.
Obesity. Being overweight puts stress on the joints in your knees and can increase your risk of developing arthritis.
History of joint injuries. Damage to a knee joint can be partly responsible for the development of osteoarthritis.
Infection. Microbial agents can infect joints and possibly cause the advancement of differing types of arthritis.
Occupation. Certain jobs requiring repetitive knee bending and/or squatting may increase your risk in developing osteoarthritis of the knee.
If you have one or more of the risk factors for arthritis, consult your doctor about preventive steps you should take (or see section on prevention below).;
, The most common symptoms of knee arthritis are joint pain and stiffness in the knee. However, depending on the type of arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis) you may experience a wide range of other symptoms as well. To recognize signs of arthritis, take a note if you experience any of the following symptoms:Pain that often worsens with activities.
Decreased or limited range of motion.
Stiffness of the knee.
Swelling and tenderness of the knee joint.
A feeling the joint may ""give out.""
Fatigue and malaise (often associated during periods of rheumatoid arthritis flares).
Low-grade fever and chills (often associated during periods of rheumatoid arthritis flares).
Deformity of the joint (knock-knees or bow-legs) is typically an advanced symptom of arthritis that has been left untreated., Not all knee pain is a sign that you might be suffering from arthritis. Arthritis pain is usually felt in the inside of the knee and in some cases in the front or back of the knee.Activities that load the knee joint, such as walking long distances, climbing up the stairs, or standing for extended periods of time, can make arthritis pain worse.
In cases of severe arthritis of the knee, the pain may occur when sitting or lying down.

, Besides pain, arthritis also decreases the range of motion in your knee. In time, and due to the loss of the gliding surfaces of the bone, you may feel that your knee is stiff and your motion is limited.As the cartilage is worn away on one side of the knee, you may discover that your knee will become more bow-legged or knock-kneed.

, Swelling is another sign of inflammation (in addition to pain, warmth and redness) and is a common symptom of arthritis of the knee. In addition, people with knee arthritis may actually feel or hear a catching or clicking within the knee joint., The symptoms of arthritis can occur gradually and often progress as the condition worsens. Learning to recognize the patterns of arthritis symptoms may help you differentiate it from other knee pains.


People with rheumatoid arthritis often experience periods of worsening of the condition called flares. During these periods the symptoms worsen, reach a peak, and then gradually lessen., If you experience one or more of the above symptoms, consult a doctor whether you might be suffering from arthritis of the knee.


Your doctor will check your knee for swelling, redness and warmth and will assess the range of motion. If your doctor suspects you might be suffering from arthritis, he may suggest some of the following tests to confirm the diagnosis:Laboratory tests to analyze markers of arthritis in your blood, urine and/or joint fluid. Joint fluid is collected via aspiration by inserting a needle into the joint space.
Ultrasound imaging to visualize soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures in your knee. Ultrasound may also be used to guide the needle placement during joint aspiration.
X-ray imaging to visualize cartilage loss and bone damage and/or spurs.
Computerized tomography (CT) imaging to visualize the bons in your knee. CT images are taken from different angles of your knee and then combined to create cross-sectional views of the internal structures.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to produce more detailed cross-sectional images of the surrounding soft tissues in your knee, like the cartilage, tendons and ligaments in your knee.

Understand that nutrient-rich food can help to speed up your recovery process.,
Concentrate on eating protein-rich foods.,
Eat more kiwis to aid in your recovery.,
Snack on some cherries to reduce swelling.,
Eat guavas to quicken the healing process.,
Make sure to stay hydrated.",How to Prepare for ACL Surgery4," It should be noted that in some instances, the healing process after a surgery is slowed and can even fail. Therefore, you need to eat the right amount and types of food before the surgery to give yourself the best chance at a healthy recovery.

, Amino-acids are the building block of protein and without protein, the body cannot heal itself. Getting a sufficient amount of protein in your diet will allow your muscles to rebuild properly and swiftly.


With this in mind, eat lean meat, legumes, and fish such as tuna, salmon, sardines, and trout.

, Though kiwis may seem tiny, they are densely packed with nutrients that can help you recover from surgery. Kiwis have an amazing amount of Vitamin C (twice as much as found in oranges). They also contains large amounts of fiber, potassium, phytonutrients, minerals, vitamins and more.


Vitamins, minerals, and potassium are known to help in collagen formation, essential for the healing of the graft.
Aim to eat at least two kiwifruits a day.
Kiwi has higher antioxidant content when it is very ripe.

, Cherries are high in anti-inflammatory substances which will decrease the swelling of your current knee injury. In addition, after the surgery, the anti-inflammatory properties of the cherries will decrease pain and swelling you experience.

, Guavas are rich in antioxidants, lycopene, and vitamin C. These substances aid in healing by supporting collagen formation, decreasing free radicals in the body, and suppressing inflammation.

, Your body will not function well without proper hydration. Water keeps your cells healthy and therefore contributes to proper healing.


This means drinking at least 8 glasses of water.

Look for irritation at the site of a small wound.Jungle rot makes its home in wounds you already received.,
Check for an ulcer.An ulcer is a serious sore or lesion accompanied by a breakdown of nearby tissue.,
Recognize when you feel pain.The first two to three weeks of jungle rot are the most painful.,
Check for a foul smell.When the pustules burst, they exude a stinky mixture of blood and pus.,
Look out for tetanus.Tetanus — also known as lockjaw — is a serious bacterial disease that affects the nervous system.,
Check for ruptured tendons.The Achilles tendon — a tendon connecting your heel to the muscles in your calf — is often at special risk for rupture if you have jungle rot.,
Look for gangrene.As the tropical ulcer progresses, it might lead to gangrene, a medical condition characterized by the death of tissue due to infection.,
Look for edema.Edema is buildup of bodily fluid that causes the skin to swell and become discolored.If you notice yourself accumulating weight in your legs or feet, experiencing stiffness in your joints, or feeling aches and pains in your legs, you probably have edema.,
Look for hyperpigmentation.Hyperpigmentation is the darkening of skin in uneven patches.You might notice the skin around your ulcer becomes discolored and darker than the rest of the surrounding skin.,
Use caution when traveling to tropical regions.As their name implies, tropical ulcers are found in the hot, tropical regions of the world.,
Stay out of mud and puddles.The bacteria that cause tropical ulcers thrive in dirty water.,
Treat wounds immediately.,
Protect your legs and feet.Walking barefoot puts you at higher risk for tropical ulcers, since the bacteria that cause it usually invade through wounds in your legs or feet.",How to Know if You Have Jungle Rot," Tropical ulcers generally occur in small wounds. Inflammation of the skin will begin soon after the wound is infected, starting small but increasing quickly in size. You’ll first notice a papule (lesion) that is raised slightly and brown, red, or pink in color.


By the fifth or sixth day, a pustule about one centimeter in diameter will develop on the site of the initial wound.
The affected skin might be reddened, itchy, and scaly.
As the inflammation continues, part of the skin will progress from a rash that's itchy and scaly to dry and peeling.;
, On your feet or legs, the ulcer will cause severe tissue damage, bleeding, and possibly a grayish slough (a layer of dead tissue separated from the rest of your skin).The center of the ulcer might be yellow or red.


It might be oval or round in shape.
If you have jungle rot, your ulcer could be from half an inch to thirteen inches in diameter. Your ulcer's size will depend on your overall health and nutrition. The healthier you are, the less serious your ulcer will be.
The ulcer will grow quickly during the first three weeks, then slow in growth until it reaches its maximum size after about six weeks.

, Walking and standing might become nearly impossible due to the pain.


In severe cases, there is marked disability where one is unable to walk. This may occur when the infection spreads to the tendon, sheath and the bones.
You can relieve pain with adequate bandaging. Use a non-adhesive dressing and change it daily. Wash the wound with clean water between dressings and pat dry., In the later stages of the disease, a foul smell might also indicate that your muscle tissues have begun to rot and die.

, Tetanus bacteria enters the body through a wound, so it is important to see your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you haven’t had one in the past 10 years. Tetanus causes painful muscle contractions, especially in the jaw, and can affect your ability to breathe. Stay aware of signs that you might have tetanus, including:Difficulty swallowing
Spasms that last several minutes
Stiffness in the neck or jaw
Fever
High blood pressure

, Ruptured tendons can be identified by hearing or feeling a pop or snap in your calf followed quickly by a terrible pain in your leg or ankle. With a ruptured tendon, you will be unable to walk properly or put a normal amount of weight on the leg.Most cases of ruptured tendons require surgery. Talk to your doctor if you suspect you’ve ruptured a tendon.

, If you suspect you have gangrene, contact a medical professional immediately for treatment. Your ulcer might have become gangrenous if:You have extreme pain in your affected limb followed by a period of numbness
Your skin near the ulcer is deeply discolored and appears bruised. It might be red, purple, black, blue, or bronze in color.
Your skin is pale, hard, numb, or cold.
You have an extreme fever and/or low blood pressure in addition to any of the above symptoms.

, Combined with related symptoms, this may indicate a case of tropical ulcers.

, This is usually temporary, but could last for several months.


The amount of time the hyperpigmentation lasts varies from person to person.

, Most of Africa and South America host the bacterium that cause tropical ulcers, as does India, Pakistan, Iran, and Southeast Asia. When traveling to these areas, steer clear of forests and jungles, as well as marshes and swamps.

, Do not step in mud and puddles. Instead, walk around them to avoid contact.


If you do get mud splashed on you, wipe it off immediately.
Those who live near the river or streams, farmers who work in rice paddies, and those who live in slum areas are at risk of developing tropical ulcers.

, Exposing wounds to the elements can increase your risk for infection. Rinse the wound with clean water. Apply a topical antibiotic to the wound site and wrap it in clean bandages. For more serious wounds, consult a doctor.


Take special care with injuries to the legs and feet, since 90% of all tropical ulcers develop below the knee.It is then best to keep the area clean and dry at all costs — especially in cases of burns.

, Plus, wearing adequate footwear decreases the chances that you’ll receive a wound that the jungle rot bacteria can enter. The bacteria that cause tropical ulcers can also spread from one person to another if the two individuals both walk about barefoot on a shared floor.


Wear clean socks and well-fitting shoes.
Additionally, wear pants that extend to the ankle.
Avoid wearing shorts.
Keep your feet dry. Do not walk in wet shoes for any significant distance. If your shoes get wet, remove them and allow them to dry.
Do not share clothes or shoes with others.

Lose weight.,
Modify your activities.,
Take joint supplements.",How to Know if You Have Arthritis in the Knee2," Probably one of the most important treatments for arthritis is losing weight, though many people find this difficult. Reducing the amount of weight your knees carry, decreases the load and damage to the joint and can lower your risk of osteoarthritis., Limiting certain activities may be necessary and learning new exercise methods may be helpful to prevent or reduce arthritis damage.Aquatic exercise is an excellent option for patients who have knee problems.
Using a cane or a crutch in the hand opposite the affected knee will help decrease the demand placed on the joint.

, Many joint supplements contain molecules that are naturally made in the body, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and are important for healthy cartilage in your knee joints.Although joint supplements may control pain, it is now clear that they do not regenerate cartilage. Good studies have shown that there is no better benefit than placebo, but risks are minima (other than to your wallet), so most orthopedists advise to give it a try.
Some doctors recommend you take joint supplements for a period of three months to see if they provide any help.
Over-the-counter joint supplements are not typically controlled by the FDA. You may want to consult your doctor before taking these supplements.

"
"
Go to physical therapy.,
Take anti-inflammatory medications.,
Get hyaluronic acid injections in your knee.,
Ask your doctor if you should take corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,
Consult your doctor whether you need a surgery.",How to Know if You Have Arthritis in the Knee3," Strengthening of the muscles around the knee joint may help decrease the burden on the knee. Preventing atrophy of the muscles is an important part of maintaining functional use of the knee and reducing further damage to the joint., Prescription and nonprescription anti-inflammatory pain medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) are drugs that help treat the pain as well as the inflammation in the knee.Always consult your doctor before attempting to treat arthritis with over-the-counter medications, especially if you are taking other medications to treat arthritis.
Never exceed the recommended dosage of any medication, including over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. Overdose of NSAIDs can be life-threatening., Hyaluronic acid helps lubricate the joint and is naturally found in the fluid of your knee. If you suffer from arthritis, the natural hyaluronic acid in your knee becomes thinner and less effective.Your doctor may recommend a hyaluronic acid (also called artificial joint fluid or visco supplementation) injection into your knee joint.
Although these injections are not helpful to everyone, they can relieve the symptoms for three to six months.

, There are some prescription medications available to treat arthritis. Consult your doctor whether you are a candidate for some of these treatment options.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (such as methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine) slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints.
Biologics (such as etanercept and infliximab) target various protein molecules involved in the immune response that leads to arthritis.
Corticosteroids (such as prednisone and cortisone) reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. They can be administered orally or injected directly into the painful joint.

, If conservative treatments are not limiting arthritis pain or are not enough to prevent further damage, you may need a surgery, such as joint fusion or joint replacement.During a joint fusion surgery, your doctor will remove the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.
During a joint replacement surgery, your doctor will remove the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one.

Pay more attention to your feet.,
Reconsider the foot pain you feel.,
Notice if your foot muscles feel weak.,
Take note of skin and toenail changes.,
Look for ulcer formation.,
Beware of complete lack of sensation.,
See your family physician.,
Get a referral to a medical specialist.,
See a podiatrist.",How to Know if You Have Neuropathy in Your Feet," You might assume that some loss of sensation or sporadic tingling in your feet is a normal and expected part of aging, but it's not. Instead, it's an early sign that the small sensory nerves in your feet aren't working properly.As such, examine your feet more often and compare the ability to feel light touch there with other parts of your body, such as your thighs or hands.


Use a pencil or pen to lightly stroke your feet (top and bottom) to see if you can feel it — better yet, close your eyes and ask a friend to do it.
Loss of sensation/vibration usually begins in the toes and slowly spreads up the foot and eventually the leg.
In the U.S., the most common cause of foot neuropathy is diabetes — 60–70% of diabetics will develop neuropathy within their lifetimes.;
, Some occasional foot discomfort or cramping may be completely normal, especially after long walks in new shoes, but constant burning pain or strange intermittent electric pain without reason is an early sign of foot neuropathy.See if changing your shoes makes a difference with your foot pain, or try some off-the-shelf shoe inserts.
Neuropathic pain usually gets worse at night.Sometimes pain receptors get so sensitized with neuropathy that covering your feet with a blanket is unbearable — a condition known as allodynia.

, If walking is becoming more difficult or you seem more clumsy / accident prone while on your feet, then that may be a sign of early motor nerve damage due to neuropathy.Foot drop while walking (leading to lots of stumbling) and loss of balance are also common neuropathic symptoms.


Try standing on your tip toes for 10 seconds and see how difficult that is — if you can't do it, then that may indicate a problem.
You may also notice involuntary twitching and loss of muscle tone in your feet.A cerebral stroke can also cause muscle weakness, paralysis and loss of sensation in your feet, but symptoms are usually sudden in onset and accompanied by several other signs and symptoms, whereas neuropathy is usually gradual., Advanced damage to autonomic nerves in your feet will likely cause you to sweat less, so there will be less moisture in the skin (which become dry, scaly and/or flaky) and toenails (which become brittle).You may notice your toenails start to crumble and look similar to a fungal infection.


If there is concomitant arterial disease caused by diabetes, lower leg skin can turn dark brown due to lack of blood flow.
In addition to color changes, the texture of the skin may change, often looking smoother and shinier than before.

, Ulceration of the skin on the feet is a consequence of advanced sensory nerve damage. Initially, neuropathic ulcers can be painful, but as sensory nerve damage progresses, the ability of the nerves to transmit pain is dramatically reduced.Repeated injury can result in multiple ulcer formation that you may not even notice.


Neuropathic ulcers usually develop on the bottoms of feet, especially in those who constantly walk around barefoot.
The presence of ulcers increases the risk of infection and gangrene (tissue death).

, Completely losing all sensation in your feet is a very dire situation and never considered normal. Not being able to feel the sensations of touch, vibration or pain makes it difficult to walk and puts you in danger of foot trauma leading to infection.In advanced stages of the disease, the muscles of the feet may become paralyzed, making walking without assistance nearly impossible.


Loss of pain and temperature sensation may lead to carelessness about accidental burns and cuts. You may be unaware that you're injuring your feet.
Complete lack of coordination and balance puts you at risk for leg, hip and pelvis fractures due to falling.

, If you suspect that your foot issue is more than just a minor sprain or strain and may be neuropathic, then see your doctor — she will give you a physical exam and ask questions about your history, diet and lifestyle. Your doctor will also likely take your blood and check for high glucose levels (a telltale sign of diabetes), certain vitamin levels and thyroid function.


You can also test your blood sugar levels at home with a store-bought testing device, but make sure you read the instructions carefully.
High levels of glucose in the blood are toxic and damaging to small nerves and blood vessels, as is too much ethanol from drinking alcoholic beverages.
B-vitamin deficiencies, especially B12 and folate, are another relatively common cause of neuropathy.Your doctor may also take a urine sample to see how well your kidneys are functioning.

, You may have to see a nerve specialist (neurologist) in order to get a confirmed diagnosis of neuropathy. The neurologist may order a nerve conduction study (NCS) and/or an electromyelography (EMG) to test the ability of the nerves in your feet and legs in transmitting electrical messages.Damage can occur in the protective covering of a nerve (myelin sheath) or underneath in its axon.


NCS and EMG are not very helpful for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy, so either a skin biopsy or quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) are sometimes used.
Skin biopsy can reveal problems with nerve fiber endings and it's easier and safer than a nerve biopsy as your skin is on the surface.
Your specialist may also perform a color Doppler test so he can see the condition of the blood vessels of your legs — to rule in or rule out venous insufficiency.

, A podiatrist is a foot specialist who can give you another informed opinion about your foot issue. A podiatrist will examine your foot for any trauma that may have damaged any nerves or benign growths or tumors that are irritating / compressing nerves. A podiatrist can also prescribe custom made shoes or orthotics (shoe inserts) for your feet to increase comfort and protection.


A neuroma is a benign growth of nerve tissue often found between the third and fourth toes."

Move around.,
Find a new way to sit.,
Wiggle your toes.,
Change your shoes.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Calm down.,
Change your sleeping position.",How to Keep Feet from Falling Asleep1," Feeling like your foot is ""asleep"" is a common sensation. It's also a feeling that most people would like to avoid. Typically, parasthesia occurs when there is a lack of movement in that body part. To keep your feet from falling asleep, make sure to move them regularly.When your nerves are compressed, they can't send normal messages to your brain. That's why you lose feeling in your feet during parasthesia.
Try rotating your ankles in gentle circles to increase blood flow to your feet. You can also gently flex your feet forwards and backwards.;
, Sitting ""cross-legged"" is comfortable for many people. You might find yourself sitting with one or both feet tucked under your body, especially if you are sitting on the floor. While sitting that way may be comfortable for you, it is also one of the most common reasons that feet fall asleep. To avoid nerve compression, try not to tuck your feet underneath you when you sit. Instead, make sure your feet are free to move around, and do not let your body weight press down on them.It's a good idea to stand up at least once an hour. Walking around is good for your overall health, too. Try setting a reminder on your phone so that you make sure to get out of your seat even when you're at work.
It is quite common to compress your nerves that run through the buttocks and back of the leg to the feet. Avoid sitting on a thick wallet on one side.
Try to sit with your legs at a 90 degree angle. Avoid sitting in a position where the back of your thighs dig into the chair. Sit at a 90 degree angle, or use a stepper to place your feet.

, One of the easiest and most effective ways to keep your feet from falling asleep is to move your toes around periodically. You can do this while you're sitting or lying down. For example, if you are watching tv, get in the habit of wiggling your toes during commercials.You can also wiggle your toes while you are standing. Have you ever had your feet fall asleep while you're waiting in a long line? Next time you find yourself in that situation, try moving your toes around inside of your shoes.
Often, feet fall asleep while you are riding a stationary bike or using an elliptical machine. Wiggle your toes periodically while you exercise and you can prevent the problem.

, It is possible for your feet to fall asleep even while you are walking. Often, this happens because of an underlying problem with the nerves in your feet. You can help alleviate this issue by wearing properly fitting shoes.Make sure that your shoes are not too tight. You should be able to move your toes around in them without pain.
Avoid wearing high-heels, as these types of shoes put added pressure on your feet.

, Anxiety is actually a cause of feeling pins and needles. If you suffer from a general anxiety disorder, helping to manage it can help you to prevent your feet from falling asleep. Try to keep your breathing slow and steady. This promotes an overall calming effect on your mind and body.During panic attacks, many people hyperventilate. This can cause pins and needles. Focus on drawing deep, slow breaths when dealing with anxiety.
Breathe in slowly for five to seven seconds, and hold each breath for two seconds before slowly exhaling.

, Controlling your anxiety is important for your mental health and also in preventing your feet from falling asleep. There are several things you can do to help manage anxiety. For example, you can try adding meditation to your daily routine.Each day, make time in your schedule to sit quietly and calm your mind. You can download guided meditations to listen to on your smartphone.
Do yoga. Yoga has wonderful benefits for both your mind and body, including easing anxiety. It is also excellent for circulation.

, If you are a sound sleeper, it is possible that you don't move much while you are sleeping. This is due to nerve compression. If you fall asleep with your legs crossed, or one foot tucked under the other, you may wake up to paresthesia.Try sleeping on your back with your legs parallel to one another. This will help keep pressure off of your feet.
If you share a bed with your partner, try sleeping a little further apart. Your feet could fall asleep if someone else puts his or her leg on top of yours.

Consider the causes.,
Seek medical attention.,
Adopt healthy habits.",How to Keep Feet from Falling Asleep2," Paresthesia is common, and often the result of sitting in the wrong position for too long. But pins and needles can also be an underlying cause of a more severe medical condition. For example, diabetes is one of the leading causes of parasthesia.Other issues that cause the problem are related to nerve damage, which can be caused by substance abuse or injury.
Vitamin deficiency can also lead to a numbness of the feet, such as Vitamin B deficiency. It’s best to check with a nutritionist, dietitian or your physician to assess any vitamin deficiency.
Seizures and migraines have also been linked to parasthesia.

, If you regularly experience parasthesia and you are unsure of the cause, schedule an appointment with your doctor. He can run tests to figure out what is causing the issue. For example, abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in your body might be the cause. A blood test can help find answers.Keep a record of when your feet fall asleep and for how long. Share this information with your doctor.
Once your doctor has determined the cause of your parasthesia, he can make a treatment plan for you.

, Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent parasthesia. It can also help prevent some underlying causes, such as certain cases of diabetes. To maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet.Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and healthy fats. Avoid added sugars and trans fats.
Exercise frequently. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity five days of the week.

Re-evaluate your position, and your progress.",How to Make the Best from a Broken Ankle1," It’s a bummer to break your ankle! Your patience and physical comfort are going to be tested. You will be experiencing more disappointment and irritation than normal. You can handle it. Put yourself in the right mental space to do so. Accept the reality of your situation to empower yourself emotionally.Practicing acceptance is a good way to feel better about your situation. As the Serenity prayer states, “Change what you can and accept the things you cannot change.”


Stay calm and recognize that you will recover. This will make the recovery process go more smoothly, and allow you more pleasure along the way. Recognize that you have an opportunity to organize your time and energy however you’d like to do so. Though it may seem forced, tell yourself that you have the freedom to choose how you’re going to benefit from (and enjoy!) your new found time.
Try meditation, deep breathing, and practicing mindfulness to help you stay calm.;
, Throughout the recovery process, you can remain active in plenty of ways. However you choose to do so, the important thing is to get some type of exercise despite your injury. For instance, you can use exercise tools such as weights or resistance bands, or go for a walk (with crutches! – instructions in this article).


Be sure to stretch after doing any kind of physical activity. You can do upper and lower body stretches while sitting.

, Many parks are designed to be extremely accessible. Find a park in a neighborhood you haven’t been to. If the weather is dreary, movie theatres often have seats with more room for those with things like crutches and casts.

, The blues come quickly to those who have to spend large amounts of time sitting around at home.This is part of the reason it is important to stay active. Join an online support group if the stress and discomfort of recovering from an ankle injury do get to you. There are even support groups online specifically for people recovering from leg injuries!


Keep in mind that to be diagnosed with depression you have a to have at least one or two depressive symptoms ongoing for at least two weeks.

, Everyone has a project they’ve been wanting to do but haven’t had the time for. Here’s your chance! Or pick up a new skill you’ve always wanted to learn. Who knows, this injury might end up leading you to a new hobby. One idea: learn to knit. This will pay of next winter, when your ears are the warmest on the block, and you’re ready to make inexpensive, high utility, and heartfelt gifts.

, Cooking is a creative and practical pursuit that you can still do with a broken ankle. Check out online resources for getting different recipes. You can find recipes for everything from dinner to baking a cake.

, Check the course list at your nearest community college. Classes are often remarkably cheap, and you’ll likely see something that peaks your interest.


Alternatively, there are many high-quality learning opportunities you can access online, including free lectures from universities like MIT.You can even learn specific and highly marketable skills like coding or photo editing online at no cost!Maybe it’s fall and you want to take a photography class, or perhaps it’s summer and you want to take a gardening class, either way this is great for self-improvement and personal growth.

, Writing is great way to express yourself creatively. It can also help you organize your thoughts for future plans. Best of all: contribute productively to an online organization or website that you already enjoy, and would like to be a part of. You could even write your own “How To…” article for WikiHow, or edit this one!

, Whenever you’re feeling yourself get frustrated or demoralized by discomfort or malaise, throw your brain a curve ball and congratulate yourself for getting through a tough week, or even just a tough day. Likewise, after moments of unexpected (or totally expected) joy, congratulate yourself for enjoying life despite your injury!

Start with an absorbent powder, like baking soda or cornstarch.,
Add a few drops of a fragrant essential oil.,
Close the lid of the container, and shake vigorously.,
Apply the powder to your feet.,
Store your powder in its lidded container in a cool, dry place.",How to Make a Natural Foot Odor Remedy1," These products will absorb moisture from the surface of your feet, preventing the continued growth of odor-causing bacteria. Place 5-10 tablespoons of whichever powder product you choose into a dry container with a lid. Other natural powders which could be substituted for baking soda or cornstarch include talcum powder, baby powder, or arrowroot powder.
You can use a single absorbent powder, or a combination of two or several if you prefer.;
, Lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oils are all popular choices. Essential oils provide a lovely fragrance, and contain natural chemicals called tannins which kill bacteria. Start with 3 or 4 drops of whichever oil or oils you choose, and add more if you'd like the powder to have a stronger smell., This will mix the essential oils with your chosen absorbent powder. After you've shaken it, remove the lid and take a whiff to determine if you'd like to add more drops of essential oil.

, You might want to stand on a towel, or set your feet in the bath tub to avoid a mess. Sprinkle over the top and bottom of your foot, paying special attention to the spaces between your toes, where bacteria tend to thrive. If your feet are already sweaty or dirty, wash them first with warm water and soap. Consider applying your powder at the start of your day, before putting on clean socks and shoes, after a shower or bath, or just before bed.
You can also use your foot powder as a shoe deodorizer. Just sprinkle the foot powder into your shoe, making sure the shoe is dry first, then leave overnight.

, Don't make too much powder at once, since essential oils evaporate over time, losing some of their potency.

Rest.,
Ice.,
Compress your ankle.,
Elevate to reduce swelling.,
Increase physical activity gradually.,
Keep yourself clean.,
Scratch!,
Aerate your casted ankle.,
Eat nutritiously.",How to Make the Best from a Broken Ankle2," Keeping weight off of your injured leg is vital to your initial recovery.Your doctor will tell you when it is OK to place any weight on your injured ankle. Most of the time, this will be at least 6 to 10 weeks. Do not put weight on your ankle too soon, as this may cause your bone to heal improperly. Rest is the first letter in a sports injury care acronym known as RICE, which stands for:


R=Rest. Prop you ankle up on a pillow and rest.
I= Ice. Ice for twenty min cycles.
C= Compress. Compress the ankle with an elastic ankle wrap or compression stocking.
E=Elevate. Elevate the foot and rest.

, Make a cold compress by wrapping ice in a moistened towel. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Hold the compress to your ankle for 20-30 minutes every 1-2 hours, especially for the first few days you’re able to do so. After 2 or 3 days, use the cold compress for 10 to 20 minutes, 3 times a day as needed., You can compress your ankle by wrapping it in an elastic ACE bandage or by wearing a compression stocking. Ask your doctor about the best option for your situation., Elevating your ankle is helpful throughout various stages of the recovery process, but particularly when you are experiencing discomfort from swelling.Sit with your foot resting above your knee periodically, perhaps when you are icing., You may end up in a splint or walking boot as you heal. Even once your actual bone has fully healed, the muscles and ligaments in your ankle, feet, and leg will be stiff and weak.


Undergo physical therapy with a professional if you feel especially weak or out of sorts.Do not increase your physical activity without talking to your doctor or physical therapist first.
Do not return to sports or long-term standing until you have full strength in your calf muscle and have full or nearly full range of motion in your ankle and foot., This may be harder than normal, especially if you’re wearing a task. To take a shower, set an upside-down plastic bucket or stool in your tub, wrap your cast in a garbage bag, prop it up and off to the side, and shower the rest of your body normally.

, Note: This one might not come with a formal doctor’s recommendation, as they tend not to like it when you stick stuff in your cast. That said, the plastic sticks that are attached to the balloons in the aisle of your grocery store may have something to say about that itch just out of your fingers’ reach.

, There are a few ways to get air in your cast to prevent the growth of odor-causing bacteria and other sources of unpleasantness inside your cast. Perhaps the best way is with a vacuum, which can draw air through the porous material that makes up your cast, forcing fresh, dry air to replace it and refresh your skin.


You can buy vacuum attachments designed for this purpose, or simply try the attachments you may already have. You just need something of a seal between the vacuum hose and the wall of your cast.

, We should all be paying attention to the quality and quantity of what we consume. This is especially important when our body is working to repair itself. There are some surprising facts associated with bone recovery in particular. Some helpful points to know:


You may actually need to increase your caloric intake. This may seem odd, since you’ll likely be more sedentary with a broken ankle. However, bone recovery processes sometimes lead to increased metabolic demand, so much so that your ideal caloric intake will be much higher than normal. If you’re your metabolic demand is not met by your caloric intake, your healing process may be slowed.Eat more protein. Research has indicated that even small increases in protein consumption will speed up your bone’s recovery process.Make sure you’re getting your nutrients. Zinc, calcium, copper, phosphorus, magnesium, and silicon are particularly important to bone health and recovery.Take your vitamins. In fact, step up your vitamin intake. Whereas protein and minerals provide the materials with which bones are rebuilt, vitamins make it happen. Vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin K, and the B vitamins have been proven to play a role in this process."

Ask for a physical therapy consult.,
Learn how to use crutches.,
Sit down safely.,

Hold both crutches in the hand corresponding with the side of your body with an injured leg, putting your weight on your strong leg and weak-side crutch.,
Stand up safely.,
Learn to climb stairs.,
Keep your crutches and home safe for movement.",How to Make the Best from a Broken Ankle3," If you have been admitted to the hospital for a broken ankle, then you can ask to have a consult with a physical therapist. A physical therapist can show you how to properly use your crutches and offer other important information about moving safely while you have a broken ankle., If you want to walk around while wearing a cast or splint – and you should – you’re going to need to use crutches. Crutches will help with both balance and stability, and will allow you to walk without putting pressure on your injured leg. In order to walk safely on crutches, be sure to wear a rubber-soled, non-slip shoe on your strong, uninjured leg.Place your weight on your uninjured leg, and grip your crutches comfortably. Move each crutch forward simultaneously. Take care not to hit your injured ankle. Place the crutch about a foot in front of you, a bit wider apart than your shoulders.
Lean your weight into the support of the crutches and step forward with your uninjured leg. The crutches will hold you during the step, until you land on the same leg you stepped forward with. Only your uninjured leg should ever touch the ground.
Turn by pivoting on your good foot, and never let your injured ankle touch anything. Go slow!
Repeat the process until you’ve arrived wherever you want to be.

, Having one operable foot and two crutches makes sitting down more difficult. You can handle it. Back up towards whatever you want to sit on until it is touching your legs. Move your injured leg in front of you and out of the way while balancing on your strong, uninjured leg. Your crutches could help here – they can act as a second foot to help stability., (If you are unable to hold both crutches in one hand, set your strong-side crutch down within reach.)
Reach back with your free hand and grab something firmly attached to whatever you’re going to sit down on.
Sit down slowly.

, Standing will require additional effort with only one operable leg. Position yourself on the front edge of your seat. Set your injured leg gently in front of you. To stand up:


Hold both crutches in your hand that corresponds with the side of your body with the injured leg. (If unable to do so, set the crutch up in such a way that you will be able to easily reach it while maintaining stability once standing.)
Use your free hand to help push yourself from your seat as you stand up with your uninjured leg.
Carefully balance on your strong, uninjured leg as you position a crutch in each hand.

, Do not attempt to walk up or down stairs on crutches until you are comfortable using them. Until then, sit down and move yourself up and down stairs one at a time. It may feel silly, but it will feel less silly, and less painful, than re-injuring your leg or busting your other ankle! Once you’re ready to use your crutches on stairs:Up: Step up with your strong leg first, then bring the crutches up at the same time, one in each arm, placing them on either side of your body.
Down: Place your crutch ends on the next step down, one in each arm, a bit wider apart than your shoulders. Move your weak leg forward and down, without resting weight on it. Move your strong leg down last.
With handrail: Hold the handrail with one hand if you feel more stable. Hold both crutches on your other side in your other hand.
Go especially slow when you are on stairs, ramps, or uneven ground.

, Check the tips of your crutches frequently and replace them when they are visibly worn down. Decrease obstructions in your home. Remove loose rugs, rugs with corners that stick up, and cords that could trip or tangle you or your crutches. Keep floors free of clutter, clean, and dry.

Use IcyHot.,
Consider your painkiller options.,
Ask your doctor about NSAIDS if you are unsure about what to take.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Make the Best from a Broken Ankle4," IcyHot can be used to treat minor aches and pains of the muscles and joints. Products like IcyHot use menthol and methyl salicylate to cause the skin to feel cool and then warm. This effectively distracts your sense of feel away from the ache or pain beneath the surface of your skin.


Use IcyHot only on the skin. Do not use IcyHot on your face or in your nether-regions. Do not touch those areas of your body when IcyHot is on your hands.
Apply a thin layer to the uncomfortable area up to 4 times a day, but no more. Rub the ointment into your skin gently, but thoroughly. Wash your hands after applying this medication.
Do not use IcyHot, Biofreeze, or Bengay on skin that is cut, scraped, sunburned, or otherwise injured. Do not use this medication in proximity to activities or environments that will increase your skin temperature.
Since there are many products similar to IcyHot available at varied strengths, always read your medications’ labels and consult a doctor with any questions.

, You’re going to be dealing with a lot of aching, itching, and swelling. Consider taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). However, be aware that the chronic use of NSAIDs can lead to gastric bleeding and ulceration. Therefore, be careful how long you are on the medication. NSAIDs are available as various types of over-the-counter pain-relievers including:


Aspirin (such as Bayer or Excedrin). Take 650mg (usually two pills) every fours, with food. Do not give aspirin to children. Naproxen sodium (Aleve). Take 400-440mg twice a day, with food. Do not take more than 500mg in one day. Talk to your doctor about Aleve for patients under 13.Ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin IB). Ibuprofen may be ideal for ankle injuries because it is both a pain medicine and an anti-inflammatory.Take 200-400mg every 4-6 hours. Do not take more than 1,200mg in one day unless advised to do so by a doctor., If you are overwhelmed by your choices, then ask your doctor. Other reasons to talk to your doctor first are if you:Are over 60 years old.
Are pregnant or nursing.
Drink three or more alcoholic beverages daily.
Have liver, kidney, or heart disease.
Are taking medication to thin the blood, for high blood pressure, or have other bleeding problems. If you’re already taking aspirin to help prevent blood clots, always take your aspirin 30 minutes before any other NSAID., When taken for less than ten days straight, NSAIDs are safe for most people. That said, several studies have raised concern about bone healing and NSAID use. More studies have been recommended. Without definitive proof of negative effects, NSAIDs are widely considered useful medications in fighting pain for those with leg injuries, though some medical professional encourage the use of acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), which relieves pain but does not have anti-inflammatory properties.Do not take NSAIDs if you are at a high risk of bone healing impairment."

Keep your feet dry as much as possible.,
Wash your feet daily with antibacterial soap.,
Rub your feet with essential oils after washing.,
Soak your feet in a salt bath.,
Exfoliate your feet with a pumice stone.",How to Make a Natural Foot Odor Remedy2," Moisture promotes the growth of bacteria, which are the root cause of most foot odor, so if you are prone to foot odor you should let your feet ""air out"" as often as possible.


Going barefoot whenever it is safe and appropriate to do so will help your feet remain dry.
Socks made from natural fibers like cotton or wool are more breathable than most synthetic materials. Wearing more breathable socks will help your feet remain dry, and free from odor.
Sprinkling a natural deodorizer like talcum powder or baking soda on your feet before putting your socks and shoes on will help them remain dry throughout the day.

, This will keep the growth of odor-causing bacteria on your feet in check by killing already present bacteria, and removing dirt and dead skin which can promote their growth. Pay special attention to the gaps between your toes, and be sure to thoroughly dry your feet after washing. , Fragrant essential oils, like tea tree and lavender oils, not only provide a pleasant scent to mask foot odor, they also contain natural disinfectants which can slow the growth of odor-causing bacteria., Dissolve half a cup of kosher salt in a liter (about 4 cups) of warm water in a basin or bucket large enough for you to comfortably rest both feet in, and allow your feet to soak in the solution for 15 minutes, then allow them to air dry. Salt is an effective disinfectant, and the salt which remains on your feet after they have air-dried will help keep your feet dry and free from bacteria.Epsom salt is a popular alternative to kosher salt, and can be prepared in the same way. Simply substitute 1/4 cup of epsom salt for the 1/2 cup of kosher salt.
You can soak your feet in this manner as often as you like, even daily. If the skin on your feet becomes irritated or over-dry, reduce the frequency of the salt soaks, or use a different kind of soak.
Other natural alternatives for soaking include lemon juice (use about half a lemon's worth per liter of water), white or apple cider vinegar (about 1/4 cup per liter) or baking soda (2 tablespoons per liter). Soaking your feet in black tea is another all-natural alternative to a salt bath. Add 5 bags of black tea to 4 cups of boiling water, and allow the tea to steep and cool to a comfortable temperature before using.

, This can help reduce the presence of odor-causing bacteria, which feed on dead skin. It is best to exfoliate after you wash or soak your feet, as moisture makes dead skin easier to remove.

Keep your shoes dry.,
Wear socks.,
Disinfect smelly shoes.,
Deodorize your shoes.,
Add a natural fragrance to cover up any remaining odor.,
Discard worn-out footwear.",How to Make a Natural Foot Odor Remedy3," The bacteria responsible for foot odor thrive in moisture, so you should make sure that you allow your shoes to dry out quickly, and remain dry, whenever you aren't wearing them. Setting your shoes in a warm, dry, well-ventilated space as soon as you take them off will help them dry out more quickly, naturally slowing the life cycle of any odor-causing bacteria.Laying your shoes in sunlight on a bright, warm day is a great way of drying them out.
Storing your shoes on a shoe rack will increase the ventilation they receive, and help them dry out faster.
Wearing the same shoes every day can prevent them from thoroughly drying out. Rotating which shoes you wear on a daily basis will help ensure that all your shoes have plenty of time to dry out between uses.

, Socks prevent moisture and bacteria from your feet from coming directly into contact with the lining of your shoes, so always wearing a pair is a simple way of preventing shoe odor without resorting to the use of any artificial products. Socks are also susceptible to infestation by odor-causing bacteria, so be sure to wash them often, and try not to wear the same pair more than once between cleanings.

, Because shoe odor is largely caused by the presence of live bacteria, it's important to eliminate bacteria in your shoes' lining. Thoroughly disinfecting your shoes before deodorizing them will help them stay fresh far longer. Steaming the inside of your shoes with a clothes steamer is a great, natural way to kill any bacteria which are present. Exposing bacteria to the high temperatures present in steam is an effective way of eliminating them without the use of chemicals.
Vinegar naturally contains acetic acid, a chemical which kills bacteria, and can be used to disinfect shoes. Simply mix one part water with one part vinegar to create a natural disinfecting solution. Apply it to the inside of your shoes (a spray bottle helps), then allow the shoes to dry thoroughly.
Contrary to popular opinion, placing your shoes in the freezer is not an effective way of disinfecting them, since a typical household freezer does not reach temperatures low enough to kill bacteria. , Once you have killed the odor-causing bacteria in your shoes, you can introduce a powdered deodorizing agent to absorb and eliminate any remaining odor and moisture. Baking soda is a popular option, but other common household products like corn starch, baby powder, and kitty litter are also good alternatives to store-bought chemical deodorizers. Simply sprinkle a generous amount of whichever deodorizer you choose inside your shoes, making sure to cover as much of the inside of your shoes as you can, then leave them in a dry place for at least 24 hours. Dispose of the powder inside your shoes, using a moist cloth to remove any excess. To avoid having to clean the powdered deodorizing agent from your shoe's lining, you can instead place the powder in a clean sock, and then insert the sock into your shoe.

, While it will not eliminate the root causes of shoe odor, a pleasant scent will mask minor odors, allowing you to go longer between cleanings. Essential oils, such as eucalyptus, clove, or tea tree oils, are good options, and provide a pleasant, long-lasting fragrance. Apply a few drops of essential oil to a wad of crumpled up newspaper, then stuff the newspaper into your shoes and leave overnight.
Citrus peels contain fragrant essential oils, and can be used to scent your shoes. Simply place the peels inside your shoes and leave overnight, then discard the peels. Teabags, especially black teas, are a great choice. Not only are they convenient and fragrant, but black tea is known to contain tannins: natural chemicals which can help kill odor-causing bacteria inside your shoe., If cleaning and deodorizing a particular pair of shoes has proven ineffective at eliminating their odor, it may be time to discard them. Keeping and wearing already stinky footwear provides a breeding ground for bacteria, which can then be transferred to your feet, or any other shoes or socks you might wear."

First and foremost, make sure that you treat your ankle very well before the event.,
Take some painkillers before the event so you are not in too much pain.,
If your ankle is feeling very sore and delicate, it's best to keep the tensor bandage on during the event.,
Ladies, try to avoid high heels.,
To avoid limping, which would be a dead giveaway of the injury, walk on the balls of your feet.,
Stay seated as much as possible to prevent unnecessary strain from your ankle.

,
When standing, keep your weight on your uninjured foot.

,
If dancing is involved, keep it low-key.,
Tell people you are feeling a bit tired, and they won't be surprised if you take frequent breaks to sit down, which will allow you to rest your ankle.

,
Take bathroom breaks every 2 hours; soak some toilet tissue in cold water and wrap it around your ankle while in the bathroom to soothe it.

,
Go home early!",How to Hide an Ankle Sprain," You have to make sure it is rested and not overworked so there won't be too much strain on it later on. This includes keeping it wrapped in a tensor bandage, icing it every 2 or 3 hours for 15 minutes and keeping it elevated above heart level.;
, Take some more with you just in case the pain elevates during the event.

, Guys should be fine because they can simply wear pants and closed toed shoes to hide the bandages. As for ladies, they can wear a nice pair of dress pants, or try wearing some cute ankle boots to hide the bandage; ankle boots are very trendy!

, Wear trendy flats or some super low kitten heels! If you absolutely must wear high heels, find intervals during the event when you can take them off and walk very delicately.

, This keeps the pressure on your foot localized to one area and will allow you to walk without bending your ankles. This should be a relatively pain-free way to walk for minor ankle injuries. Be aware that if you are walking in high heels, it will be extremely difficult to keep your weight on the balls of your feet and will probably be painful.

,,, Keep your legs still or slowly moving from side-to side and compensate by swinging your waist and arms around more.

,,, Don't push yourself to stay out on your feet too late because you could do some serious damage to your already injured ankle. Your friends and family will understand if you leave earlier than usual; everyone gets tired once in a while!

, The ACL is meant to stabilize the leg and provide support during weight bearing activities. High body weight is a risk factor and a leading cause of ACL injury, because of the extra stress placed on the ligament by an overweight body. You can easily accelerate your dog's healing process by reducing the body weight of your dog. Try lowering your dog's body weight with a combination of diet and exercise.


To reduce the body weight of your dog, decrease its calorie intake at least 60%.
Don't reduce the calorie intake suddenly, but rather feed your dog smaller portions more throughout the whole day.

To minimize any digestive upset, try to ease your dog into the new diet gradually. Make sure to monitor the outcome of your weight reducing program regularly.


Be sure include regular, but non-vigorous, exercise for your dog. The exercise may include walking or running.

In the case of a severe ACL injury with inflammation, exercise should be postponed until after you give your dog some NSAIDs to reduce pain.
If your dog has a severely torn ACL, specialized hydrotherapy (walking/swimming in water) is recommended.


Please consult with your vet to get an appropriate exercise list based on the clinical condition of your dog.
Due to lowered pressure on knee joint, your dog will be able to heal its ligament faster.

, Full rest and limited activity will give your dog's body the chance to heal. Lower inflammation due to rest will allow the body to heal itself naturally. Some veterinarians advise you totally restrict the activity of your dog, while others advise some limited exercise.


You should not allow your dog to jump up to catch a ball or Frisbee or to jump out of a truck or off a porch.
You can practice a short-leash walk with your dog only.

, Sometimes, using a towel as a sling under the hip of your dog to support its weight can be helpful to speed up healing. The towel sling is commercially available, or you can make one easily by using a bath towel or recycled children's jacket in your home.


For using a bath towel, you should cut a large bath towel in half and apply it under the lower abdomen of your dog. By applying upward pressure, while holding both ends of the towel, you can help your dog walk.
Commercially available athletic bandage can also be used for this purpose.
If you use a recycled jacket, you should cut the sleeves so that the jacket fits on your dog’s abdomen.

Try a sugar scrub.,
Do a weekly foot soak.,
Use a pumice stone after a shower or bath.,
Apply coconut oil or olive oil to your feet.",How to Heal Dry Skin on Your Feet1," Sugar is a natural product that helps to remove dry skin and soften any hard or cracked skin. You can make a basic sugar scrub by combining brown or white sugar with a small amount of olive oil and an oil extract. You can also add essential oils to the mixture if you want so your feet end up soft and smelling good.To make a sugar scrub, combine ⅔ cup granulated white sugar, ⅓ cup packed brown sugar, and ½ cup olive oil in a mason jar. You can also add one tablespoon vanilla extract to give the scrub a vanilla scent.
You can make a soothing peppermint foot scrub by combining 1 cup of Epsom salt, ¼ cup olive oil or almond oil, and 10-15 drops of peppermint essential oil in a mason jar.;
, Soaking your feet will help to hydrate and soften any dead skin. You should try to follow a foot soak with a good scrub with a pumice stone to help remove dry skin and leave your skin feeling soft and refreshed.


Avoid soaking your feet in Epsom salt, as it can end up drying out your feet more. Instead, add ½ cup of apple cider vinegar to a warm bath and soak your feet in the solution for 10 to 15 minutes., A pumice stone is made of volcanic rock and is useful for removing dead skin on your body, including your feet. Run a warm bath and add a small amount of Epsom salt to the water. Let your feet soak for several minutes and then rub them with a pumice stone. The water epsom salt bath will help to loosen up the dead skin, making it easier to remove.Follow this foot scrubbing routine every night or several times a week. Using a pumice stone on a consistent basis will also allow any foot moisturizers you are using to penetrate your skin and soften hard or cracked skin on your feet.

, Use an all natural moisturizer to sooth and soften your feet. Avoid creams that contain alcohol, as alcohol can dry and irritate your skin. You can also use Vaseline, or cocoa butter to moisturize your feet.


Apply a generous layer of coconut oil or olive oil to your feet at night before bed and then wear socks to seal in the moisture and to keep your feet from drying out in the night."

Utilize therapeutics.,
Try rehabilitation therapy.,
Get your dog orthotics.,
Utilize some physical therapy exercises.,
Try prolotherapy to regenerate the ligaments.,
Look into stem cell regenerative therapy.,
Know when surgery is necessary.",How to Heal a Torn Dog ACL Without Surgery2," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are sometimes helpful to heal the torn ligament. The anti-inflammatory drug will relieve your dog's pain during the observation period. Different groups of NSAIDs are used in ACL treatment. The doses vary depending on pain levels, and your dog's body weight and body condition.


Commonly used NSAIDs are oxicam derivatives (Meloxicam). They are used for different types of muscle and skeletal pain.

The commonly used doses are: Meloxicam (Trade: Melovet ®-5mg) @ 1ml/25 kg, Firocoxib (Previcox®) @ 2.27mg/lb/day (5mg/kg), Carprofen (Rymadil®) @ 2 mg/lb/day.
However, drug availability and legislation may vary in different countries.


In general, low doses and short term usage is very safe while higher doses used long term use can cause some side effects.
If your dog is suffering from side effects like vomiting, lethargy, depression or diarrhea, stop the drug treatment and consult with a veterinarian.

, Rehabilitation therapy by a trained practitioner may speed the healing of the ACL. This option includes a range of motion and mobilization exercises, aquatic walking, cavaletti walking, and controlled slow leash walking. If the condition is improved, you can gradually introduce stair climbing and sit-to-stand exercises.


Aquatic walking or swimming will increase the muscle strength of your dog.
You may find some veterinary hospitals that have these facilities, including special tanks and whirlpools for hydrotherapy.
Some other practices of physiotherapy can be helpful, including cryotherapy, laser therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation.

, An external orthotics or knee brace can be used to support the joint, but there is a limited amount of research done on the effects of this treatment. The purpose of using an orthopedic brace is to support the joint and ligaments by allowing the relaxation of the injured legs.


Braces are often made with hard elastic materials and set up in between the femur and tibia to prevent unwanted movement of knee joint.
Dogs that are advanced in age or too young for surgery are often the ideal candidates for an orthopedic brace.
Braces can provide an alternative when the surgical treatment is not affordable for the owner.

, Once your dog has regained some amount of mobility and strength, you can try a few light exercises to attempt to rehab the ligaments. These exercises should only be tried once they are approved by a veterinarian, or they could hurt your dog further. Evidence suggests that physical therapy by a trained rehabilitation practitioner can advance your dog's recovery from surgery. However, this evidence does not suggest that physical therapy is a reliable alternative to surgery for most dogs.


Sit to stand. On a floor with good footing, ask your dog to sit and tuck the knee as close as possible to the body. Then ask your dog to stand as slowly as possible thus causing it to put weight on the affected leg. Do 5 repetitions 3 times daily.
Weight shifting. On a floor with good footing, with your dog in a standing position, rock the pelvis so that weight is forced on the affected leg. Start lightly first and increase force as your dog becomes more comfortable. You can actually apply enough force so that your dog takes small sideways steps to each side. Do 10 repetitions 3 times daily.
Unilateral weight bearing. Lift the unaffected limb off the ground. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds. Move the foot around and put your dog off balance if he/she tries to lean on your hand. Another way to do it is to tape an object (like a pen) under the uninvolved foot to force full weight on involved side – only do with supervision.
Circles and figure eights. While on a leash, get your dog on your left side and then walk in tight circles and figure of 8’s. This encourages weight bearing on both legs and increases strength and balance.

, Prolotherapy, also known as nonsurgical ligament reconstruction, is a medical treatment for chronic pain. “Prolo” is short for proliferation, because the treatment causes the proliferation (growth, formation) of new tissue in areas where it has become weak. A proliferant (substance that promotes tissue rebuilding) is injected into the affected ligaments or tendons causing a localized inflammation which “turns on” the healing process and directly stimulates the growth of new collagen, strengthening damaged and weak ligaments and tendon tissue.


Prolotherapy is primarily used to treat joint pain, and has been shown to increase joint ligament strength by 30-40% in humans. Clinical results using prolotherapy in dogs and cats appear to indicate the same response.
As the tendons and ligaments grow stronger, and more capable of supporting and maintaining normal joint stability, the pain is alleviated.
Prolotherapy is a possibility to consider when dealing with a partial tear, particularly if your dog is older or could not undergo anesthesia.

, Stem cell regenerative therapy is a relatively new treatment. It has been successfully used to treat arthritis and other degenerative conditions in dogs, with very exciting results. However, this therapy does require a minor surgery to harvest the stem cells and anesthesia for both the harvesting and the injection of the stem cells.

, Once a dog is undergoing treatment, most veterinarians recommend a period of 4-5 weeks for observation. After that period, your dog should walk well on its knee, or with a mild limp. If the condition still remains the same, you need to go for a surgical procedure. In most cases, the lightweight dog can recover without surgery, while oftentimes heavy weight dogs can’t.


It is important to know that even if the symptoms resolve, there might be a chance of developing secondary complications like arthritis.

Arthritis is a non-reversible change in the joint, and delayed or partially healed ACL injury can increase its severity.
Moreover, your dog will favor another leg to bear the body weight instead of affected leg. It may (in more than 50% of cases) cause the gradual rupture of another ACL.

Progress to weight resistance exercise.",How to Heal after Arthroscopic Knee Surgery," Following your arthroscopic knee surgery, it's important to do what your doctor thinks is most appropriate for the best possible recovery. Your knee may not end up being perfect, but following specific advice about controlling inflammation and pain, as well as stimulating healing, will lead to the best outcome for your particular injury.


Almost all arthroscopic knee surgery is done on an outpatient basis and lasts only a few hours at most.Arthroscopy can be performed under local, regional, or general anesthesia, which prevents you from feeling pain during the surgery.
The most common conditions that warrant arthroscopy of the knee are: torn meniscus cartilage, pieces of cartilage within the joint space (known as ""joint mice""), torn or damaged ligaments, chronically inflamed joint lining (called synovium), misaligned kneecap (patella) or removal of cysts behind the knee.;
, Your doctor will recommend medications mainly to control pain and inflammation, but possibly also to deter infections and/or blood clots depending on your diagnosis, age and overall health condition. Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of stomach ulcers.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin help you deal with inflammation and pain.
Analgesics such as opioids, diclofenac and acetaminophen help you to get relief from pain, but not inflammation.
Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infections, whereas anticoagulants prevent blood clots.

, To help prevent inflammation in your knee naturally, elevate your leg higher than your heart level by using pillows to support the leg while you rest. This will help blood and lymph fluid return into circulation as opposed to collecting in your lower leg or knee.It's easier to elevate your leg while lying on the couch instead of sitting in a chair.


Total bed rest is not a good idea for any type of musculoskeletal injury because some movement (even just limping around the house) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. As such, some rest is good, but complete inactivity is counterproductive.

, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries because it restricts blood vessels (reducing inflammation) and numbs nerve fibers (reducing pain).Cold therapy should be applied above and around the scar from the operation for about 15 minutes every 2-3 hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your knee with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation and limit swelling.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, You will leave the hospital with a sanitized dressing covering your knee, which will absorb any blood that leaks from the wound. Your surgeon will tell you when you can shower or bathe, and when you should change the dressing in order to reduce the likelihood of infection.The main intention is to keep the surgical incision clean and dry. Using some antiseptic solution on the wound as you change the bandage is a good idea.


In most cases, you'll be able to fully wash your body about 48 hours after surgery.
Common antiseptic solutions include iodine, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.
Check with your surgeon before applying anything to the wound. For example, iodine can impede wound healing and has fallen out of favor with some surgeons

, Signs of infection post-surgery include: increased pain and swelling near the incision, drainage of pus and/or red streaks extending from the affected area, fever and lethargy. If any of these signs manifest, then see your doctor immediately.


Your doctor will treat your infection with systemic antibiotics and local antiseptic solutions.
In more extreme cases, your infected wound may have to be drained of the pus and fluid.

, Arthroscopic surgery may alleviate most of your knee pain almost immediately, but be very careful and resist the urge to participate in any strenuous activity during the first few days or so to allow for healing. Any exercise during the first few days post surgery should be very mild and focused on leg muscle contractions and mobilization without weight bearing, such as slowly raising your leg while lying on your bed or sofa.After a few days, focus on regaining your balance and coordination by putting more weight on your leg, but support yourself with a chair or against the wall in case you lose your balance.
Complete inactivity (such as bed rest) is not recommended post surgery — muscles and joints need to move and get ample blood flow in order to heal.

, Most likely you'll need to take some time off from your job, especially if it involves much standing, walking, driving or lifting. Recovery from simple arthroscopic procedures is usually relatively fast (a few weeks), but you may need to use crutches during that time.If parts of your knee have been repaired or rebuilt, you may not be able to walk without crutches or a knee brace for several weeks, and full recovery may take several months to a year.


Make sure to get your crutches fit to your height, otherwise you might develop a shoulder injury.

, If you have a physical job, then talk to your boss about switching to something less demanding, if possible. For example, maybe you can do something more sedentary at the office or work from home on the computer. Even driving is typically restricted from 1-3 weeks after an arthroscopic knee procedure, so merely getting to work might be very difficult.When you'll be able to drive depends on: the knee involved, whether your car is manual or automatic, the nature of the procedure, your level of pain, and whether you are using narcotic pain medications.
If your right knee is involved (which is needed to press the gas and brake pedals), expect to be restricted from driving for a longer duration.

, After a few days, depending on your pain level, it should be safe to do some exercises while laying on the floor or bed. Regular exercise to restore your knee mobility and strength is necessary, and for the most part, it can be carried out at home.Your orthopedic surgeon may recommend that you exercise your leg for approximately 20-30 minutes, 2-3x daily. Start with muscle contractions around the knee without actually flexing the knee joint very much.


Contract your hamstring muscles: lay down or sit with your knees bent to about 10 degrees or so; pull your heel against the floor, tightening the muscles in the back of your thigh as you do so; hold for 5 seconds, then relax; repeat 10x.Contract your quadricep muscles: lay on your stomach with a towel rolled under the ankle of your recuperating knee; push your ankle down against the towel roll — your leg should straighten out as much as possible; hold for 5 seconds, then relax; repeat 10x., Once you've lightly worked the muscles surrounding the knee with isometric contractions, try some weight bearing ones while standing. As you increase the intensity of your exercising, you may experience some temporary setbacks — if your knee swells up or starts to ache after a particular exercise, stop the activity until your knee settles down.


Partial squat while holding onto a chair: hold onto the back of a sturdy chair or countertop with your feet 6-12 inches from the chair or counter. Do not bend all the way down. Keep your back straight and hold for 5-10 seconds. Slowly come back up, relax and repeat 10x.Standing quadriceps (thigh muscle) stretch: standing with your recuperating knee bent, gently pull your heel toward your butt muscles, which should create a stretch in the front of your leg (thigh). Hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat 10x.Forward step-ups: step forward and up onto a 6-inch stool, leading with your recuperating leg. Step back down and then repeat 10x. Increase the height of the stool or platform as your leg strength increases., The final phase of rehabilitating your knee involves using weight resistance via weight machines or exercise bikes. If you're not accustomed to going to the gym and weight training, then consider the help of a personal trainer or physical therapist. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your knee, and if need be, treat your sore muscles with modalities such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.Ride the stationary bike. Start pedaling for 10 minutes a day with the resistance on the lowest level, then progress to 30 minutes with significantly more resistance.
Try leg extensions with weights when cleared by your orthopedist. Find the leg extension machine at the gym and select the minimum weight. In a seated position, hook your ankles around the padded protrusions and try to straighten your legs. Hold for a few seconds and slowly lower your legs back down — repeat 10x and gradually increase the weight over the course of a few weeks. Stop the exercise if it is painful and check with your doctor before continuing.

Apply cold to the ligament.,
Compress the injured limb.,
Use crutches, if necessary.,
Put a brace on the injured area.,
Elevate the injured ligament.,
Provide time for healing.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Supplement your diet with vitamins and nutrients.",How to Heal Ligaments1," Make sure to apply an ice pack to the injury as quickly as you can. Do this by covering your skin with a towel and then placing a bag of ice on the injured area. Keep the ice on the injured area for 10 to 30 minutes every 1 to 2 hours. Continue to apply ice to the area for 2 to 3 days., After icing the area, you should compress the injury. Use some sort of elastic bandage to apply pressure to the area. Compressing the injury will help stabilize it and limit swelling.Make sure whatever compression device you use does not limit blood flow to the limb.

, If you do need to get around, you should use crutches or similar devices to aid in movement. Crutches will take pressure off the injured limb and enable the healing process to continue without further stressing the ligament.Your doctor may recommend a knee walker or some other device instead of crutches.

, Braces used in conjunction with crutches or knee walkers. They are intended to stabilize the injured limb and to prevent further damage. Without a brace, you may not be able to walk, and if you do, you could wind up worsening your condition.


Knee braces are one of the most common types of braces. They are commonly used to treat ACL problems.
Braces are only effective for some people with ligament damage., Raise the strained ligament above your heart as often and as long as possible. This will reduce swelling. An ankle, knee, or foot can be propped up on pillows or a chair. If your wrist is injured, use books or a pillow to keep it elevated as you work., Perhaps the most important element of healing a ligament is time. Unfortunately, it may take a very long time for a ligament to completely heal. This, though, depends on the level of injury.


A grade 1 ligament injury may only take a couple days to heal.
A grade 2 ligament injury may require you to use crutches or a brace for several days. In addition, you may need to withdraw from sports or exercise for up to two months
A grade 3 ligament injury could require a brace or cast for over a month and could take weeks or months to health completely., Anti-inflammatory medication will limit pain and decrease swelling. Just make sure to follow the products’ directions and consult a doctor if you have any side effects.


Avoid medicines like NSAIDS if you suspect there is bone damage., There are several vitamins that you will need for your ligaments to heal in a timely fashion. As a result, make sure you are getting enough vitamins and nutrients daily. The best way to get these is to have a diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, flax seeds, and fish. You can also take a supplement. Make sure to get enough:


Vitamin C
Vitamin A
Omega-3 fatty acids
Zinc
Antioxidants

Use heel balm.,
Buy a battery powered foot file.,
Ask your doctor about medicated foot cream and ointment.,
Talk to your doctor if you suspect you have Athlete’s foot or eczema.",How to Heal Dry Skin on Your Feet2," Heel balm can come in a container or in stick form and will help to moisturize your dry and cracked heels. Put it on in the morning to increase the elasticity of the skin on your heels before you start to walk around and move for the day and then put it on again at night to hydrate your feet while you sleep.You may find heel balm to be slippery on your heels, especially when you move around during the day in shoes without socks. If so, start with a small amount of heel balm on the rims of your heels and on any cracked areas.
If you don’t want to get heel balm on your hands, you can use a heel balm stick for easy application.

, These foot files act like power sanders for your feet and are great for removing dry, dead skin. You simply hold the foot file in your hand and run it over your feet, preferably in the bathtub so the dry skin does not end up all over your bathroom. Wash away the powdery foot dust with water once you are done using the foot file. Try to get into the habit of using the foot file twice a week.Most battery powered foot files are $30-$40USD. They are a good option if you are looking for a quick and fast way to remove dry skin on your feet.

, Though home remedies can help remove dry skin and prevent foot irritation, your doctor may be able to recommend over the counter foot creams or medicated ointments to speed up the healing of your dry skin.There are many over the counter foot creams that can help relieve dry skin on your feet. Your doctor may also prescribe a stronger cream or ointment, depending on the severity of your dry skin.

, If you display the symptoms of Athlete’s foot, such as an irritated or burning sensation on your feet, peeling and cracked skin, and bleeding and pain, you should speak to your doctor about treatment. Your doctor will prescribe a topical, antifungal foot cream, or an antifungal drug, to help treat your Athlete’s Foot.


You should also check if you have symptoms of eczema on your feet, such as scaly skin, painful breaking of the skin, and possibly weeping or bleeding from the skin. Your doctor should help you determine the cause of your eczema, such as an irritant that you use when working or a substance in your shoes or socks, and prescribe a steroid cream or ointment."

Wash your feet every day.,
Dry your feet well after a shower or bath.,
Wear comfortable shoes that don’t restrict or rub your feet.,
Alternate your shoes and change your socks every day.,
Drink lots of water to stay hydrated.,
Be cautious when getting a professional pedicure in a nail salon.",How to Heal Dry Skin on Your Feet3," Hygiene plays a key role in maintaining skin integrity. Soap, although important in hygiene, can cause irritation and may not help in removing any of the dead skin caused by dryness. Instead, rinse your feet thoroughly with warm water every time you bathe in order to promote moisture. Warm water (40 to 34°C) promotes circulation and both comforts and refreshes your feet.Always wash the bottoms of your feet well and between your toes. You should use a washcloth to get between your toes or use a long handled sponge on your feet if you prefer not to have to bend down in the shower.

, Make sure you dry well between your toes with a towel as this will prevent the develop of infection, and reduce any odors or bacteria on your feet., Tight, uncomfortable shoes can cause painful foot growths and distort your toe shape. They can also irritate your feet and lead to blisters and cracked skin. Try to wear comfortable shoes that fit well on a daily basis, especially if you are always on your feet throughout the day.If you wear high heels, look for heels that are wide, stable, and no higher than two inches. Make sure there is enough room in your heels for your toes, as your shoes should not narrow until well past the balls of your feet. You should also alternate your heels heights regularly to prevent your Achilles tendon from shortening.
Avoid wearing flip flops and completely flat shoes, as they do not provide arch support. You should also avoid walking around barefoot to avoid developing flat feet. Minimize the amount of time you wear shoes with no arch support to keep your feet healthy and strong.

, Try to alternate your shoes so you do not wear the same pair every day, even if you have two pairs of the same style. This will prevent shoe odor, and foot infections.You should also change your socks every day so you wear a fresh pair. This will prevent foot irritation and infections, which could trigger dry and cracked skin.

, Promoting hydration is one of the best ways to keep any part of your skin healthy, including the skin on your feet. If possible, drink whenever you are thirsty--thirst is your body’s way of telling you that you are becoming dehydrated. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water every day., Make sure the nail salon sanitizes and cleans every metal instrument before they use them on your feet and only go to a nail salon that is known for its good hygiene.A good nail salon can help remove dry skin from your feet, massage your feet to improve blood circulation, and moisturize your feet so they look their best.

Consult your doctor.,
Visit a rheumatologist or orthopedic doctor.,
Talk to a personal trainer.,
Have your doctor run diagnostics.",How to Heal Ligaments2," Your primary care physician can evaluate the extent of your injury. They can provide treatment and relief for minor strains, and if it is more serious, they can refer you to an orthopedic doctor. If needed, you may even receive a prescription for anti-inflammatory medication., These doctors specialize in the skeletal muscular system and will be able to make a sound judgement about how to best treat a ligament injury. They’ll question you about the cause of your injury, symptoms, and then advise you about the most appropriate treatment.A specialist (like a rheumatologist or orthopedic doctor) might recommend surgery or some other course of action.

, Depending on the severity of your injury, you’ll want to consult a personal trainer about steps you can take to promote ligament healing. Ultimately, a personal trainer will likely recommend that you limit stress to the damaged limb while working out muscles that surround the damaged ligament.Ask your doctor if they can recommend a personal trainer.

, There are several diagnostics that will provide your doctor with information about the severity of your ligament damage. Without running these diagnostics, your doctor might not be certain as to its extent and whether damage impacts other ligaments, tendons, or bones.


Your doctor will likely start with an X-ray. Although an X-ray won’t detect ligament damage, it will let the doctor know if there is a broken or fractured bone involved.
After an X-ray, your doctor will likely prescribe an MRI. An MRI will create a picture of your skeletal-muscular system – including ligament damage."

Get a reference to a surgeon.,
Have reconstructive surgery.,
Use a continuous passive movement machine (CPM).,
Commit to physical therapy.",How to Heal Ligaments3," If the strain has not healed within two weeks of basic treatment, you may need surgery. Ask your doctor for a referral to a musculoskeletal specialist or to a surgeon skilled with ligament surgery., Some ligament damage, particularly ACL problems, can only be healed or corrected through surgery. If your damage is severe enough, your doctor will likely recommend surgery. When you undergo ligament surgery, your surgeon will likely replace your damaged ligament with a nearby tendon.


Ligament reconstructive surgery is successful about 95% of the time.
The reconstructive ligament will likely function just as good as the old one. It will also last you for the rest of your life., Your doctor will likely prescribe a CPM machine for you to use after your surgery. The machine will move your limb (often your leg) through a range of motions. It will start slow and with limited motion and gradually increase speed and intensity., For most people, the only way to finish the healing process initiated by reconstructive surgery is to go through physical therapy. In physical therapy, a therapist will work with you to regain your full range of motion in a slow and measured manner.


Your doctor will likely recommend you attend physical therapy three days a week.
You’ll have to perform your physical therapy exercises at home every day.
You could need days, weeks, or even months of physical therapy to completely recover."

Work on a way to safely lose weight.,
Choose how you lose weight; be it by dieting or exercising.,
Look at your current food intake.,
Exercise.",How to Improve Knee Pain Associated with Osteoarthritis1," Research findings continue to support the notion of weight loss being linked to decreased cartilage loss in the medial tibia - a key cause of osteoarthritis. A study carried out by Australian researchers in February 2014found that with every 1% weight loss, there was a 1.2mm^3 decrease in the loss of medial tibial cartilage volume - subsequent studies might put this into question, however, so don't take it as a hard and fast rule.;
, Obviously your ability to do the latter will be dependent upon the intensity of the pain that you experience.

, Are there any cutbacks you can make, not only in terms of snacking between meals, but in switching to lower calorie versions of the spreads, drinks, and so on in your fridge. A diet doesn't have to be a complete denial of the foods that you love. It can just be a series of adjustments to the foods that you already eat. If you don't have a lot of weight to lose, that is. If you have a lot of weight to lose, a more traditional and regimented diet may be required.

, This doesn't mean getting to the gym and pumping iron for 3 hours a day. Exercising can just mean going on short walks more regularly - walking to the grocery store rather than driving or taking public transport, parking further away from a shopping precinct so you have to walk further to get to where you want. As with dieting, exercising doesn't have to be a punishing regime of calorie counting and footstep monitoring - you're more likely to keep up with regular exercise if it's not too inconvenient for you to do so, you might even enjoy it!

Choose low-heeled shoes and loose clothing.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Do a restorative yoga pose.,
Maintain a balanced diet.,
Quit smoking and limit your alcohol consumption.",How to Get Rid of Varicose Veins1," Keeping your legs in the same position for an extended length of time reduces circulation in your legs and can cause blood to pool in your veins. Focus on shifting or changing the position of your legs to maintain good circulation.Change your position every 30 minutes or so. Take a walk around the office or, if this is not possible, stand up and stretch your arms and legs every 30 minutes.;
, Elevating your legs while you sit can ease the pressure on your blood vessels. Keeping your legs uncrossed can also reduce pressure on your veins.Place your feet on a stool or another chair, when possible, to improve the circulation in your legs. Try occasionally lifting your legs so that your feet are above the height of your heart.

, Elevate your legs as you sleep, as well. Keeping your legs elevated as you lie down can be just as important as elevating them when you are sitting down., Wearing high heels and tight clothing can make it more difficult for blood to pass through your veins. Low-heeled shoes or flats cause your calf muscles to work more as you walk, which also helps with circulation of blood flow in your legs.You should especially avoid tight clothes that cut off circulation around your waist, legs, or groin. Go for loose clothing or clothing that does not squeeze or constrict these areas.

, Including moderate exercise into your daily routine can improve both the circulation and muscle tone in your legs.Exercising on a regular basis will also help you lose weight, if needed. If you are overweight or obese, shedding your extra pounds can ease the pressure on your legs and greatly minimize varicose veins.


A 30-minute walk or jog around your neighborhood a few days a week can greatly improve your overall circulation, especially the circulation in your legs.
Focus your efforts on cardiovascular exercises, which help to get the blood pumping throughout your body, and strength training exercises that target the legs in order to build and tone muscle mass there.

, Restorative yoga is a type of yoga that uses props like a wall, a bolster or a block to support your body. In restorative yoga, there should be no muscle activation at all and you should use this practice to release any stress or tension in your muscles. Legs-against-the-wall pose is great for circulation and blood flow, thereby lowering the potential for varicose veins in your legs. Find a quiet, open area with a wall and place your yoga mat against the wall. Have a bolster or several rolled up towels next to your mat to use in these poses.If you have stiffer muscles, the bolster or support should be lower under your back, just above your tailbone, and placed farther from the wall. If you’re more flexible, the bolster should be closer to the wall. Your distance from the wall also depends on your height: if you’re shorter, move closer to the wall. If you’re taller, move farther from the wall.
Start with the bolster 5–6 inches from the wall. Sit sideways on the right end of the support. Exhale and swing your legs up onto the wall. Keep your shoulders and head on the floor. Your sitting bones don’t need to be right against the wall, but they should be a few inches from the wall. The bolster should be under your back area, higher or lower depending on your flexibility.
Bend your knees, press your feet into the wall, and lift your pelvis off the bolster a few inches. Then, tuck the bolster a little higher up, under your pelvis and lower back. Then, lower your pelvis onto the bolster and straighten your legs so they are now stretched out against the wall.
Keep your legs firm, with just enough weight to hold them vertically in place. Release your skull away from the back of your neck and open your shoulder blades away from your spine. Release your hands and arms out to your sides, palms up.
Stay in this pose for five to 15 minutes. You should feel the blood draining from your legs, into your hip area. This is a sign the blood flow is being reversed and flushed out.
Do not twist off the support when coming out of this pose. Slide off the bolster onto the floor and then bend your knees. Roll to one side and stay in the fetal position, with your knees bent and your head tucked in, for a few breaths.

, A balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables can keep your salt levels down and your fiber levels high, thereby stabilizing your blood pressure and putting less press on your veins.A low-salt diet will minimize the amount of swelling in your legs connected to water retention. You should also focus on eating foods rich in fiber, such as whole grains like rice and quinoa. Bioflavonoids found in dark berries, dark leafy greens like kale and spinach, garlic, and onions also help to keep your veins healthy.

, Tobacco and alcohol can cause high blood pressure. Cutting them out of your life or reducing their presence can help you get reduce your varicose veins.Alcohol can cause your blood vessels to dilate, which, in turn, can aggravate varicose veins. An occasional drink may not hurt, but frequent drinking will.
Smoking has a direct connection to blood pressure, and cutting smoking out completely is important if you plan to be rid of your varicose veins.

, You might want a discrete brace that could be hidden under clothing, or you could want a more substantial brace where you're happy to sacrifice subtlety for greater protection.

, There are a number of knee brace manufacturers who all specialise in slightly different areas of the knee brace market - one manufacturer might specialise in elastic, pull up knee braces, for example. Chances are you'll want to find the best manufacturer for your chosen style and level of support.

, Different manufacturers require different measurements, so if you do decide to order a knee brace, have all three of these measurements ready - they could ask for any one of them, or all of them!

, With the knee brace ordered and worn, it should work to shift your weight off the most damaged portion of your knee - so you should experience an improvement in your knee pain even while carrying out your normal routine.

Book an appointment with a physiotherapist.,
Research and buy a TENS machine.,
Follow the manufacturer's instructions to put the physiotherapist's advice or your own deductions into action.",How to Improve Knee Pain Associated with Osteoarthritis4," They will be able to assess your condition and make recommendations about how to use the TENS machine. Be honest with them, if the electrical current that they apply feels uncomfortable or doesn't help at all - just say. They'll be able to adjust the current accordingly. You can, of course, do this without a physiotherapist, but it is likely to be a much quicker (and potentially less painful!) process with their help than it would be without it.

, Prices of TENS machines can vary dramatically, depending on the functions available and the overall quality of the machine.

, As TENS machines are small and lightweight, you can carry one with the electrodes already attached to your knee, that way, it's ready to be immediately deployed when necessary. Please take care if you do decide this though, there are a number of areas that you should never put the electrodes over like broken or irritated skin, varicose veins and so on - the instructions that came with the machine will expand upon this.

Wear compression stockings.,
Talk to your doctor about sclerotherapy.,
Speak to your physician about surface laser treatments.,
Learn about endovenous thermal ablation.,
Ask your doctor about vein ligation and stripping.,
Consider PIN stripping.,
Try ambulatory phlebectomy.,
Ask your doctor about endoscopic vein surgery.In this treatment, an endoscope in inserted into the vein and used to close the vein from the inside.",How to Get Rid of Varicose Veins2," These elastic stockings put therapeutic pressure on the veins of your legs, easing any leg pain and temporarily keeping your varicose veins in check. They are often tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart. However, compression socks are not guaranteed to prevent varicose veins from getting worse or prevent new varicose veins from appearing.Compression stockings come in a variety of different sizes and pressures. Most people with varicose veins will be prescribed a class one (light compression) or class two (medium compression) stocking. They’re also available in different colors, lengths (to the knee or to the thigh), and different foot styles (covering your whole foot or stopping just before your toes).
You can purchase compression tights from your local pharmacy or directly from a manufacturer online. Your doctor can also prescribe compression socks for you, based on the severity of your varicose veins.
While compression socks can improve circulation in your legs, you will likely need to wear them all day to see any noticeable results, they can make your legs hot and sweaty, and you will need to replace the socks every three to six months., This is a type of injection that causes the varicose vein to close and fade from sight.During the procedure, your doctor will use a needle to inject a special chemical into the vein which will cause the vein walls to swell, stick, and ultimately shut. Blood flow stops completely and the vein eventually turns into a scar and fades from sight.
No anesthesia is needed, but you may need multiple treatments for the same vein. Treatments are performed every four to six weeks.
Another form of this therapy called microsclerotherapy may be used for spider veins or other small varicose veins.

, Laser therapy is usually used on smaller veins. A strong laser light is directed at the varicose vein in short bursts, eventually causing it to disappear. The treatment is not generally effective for varicose veins larger than 1/10 inch (3 mm).Laser treatments can last for 15 to 20 minutes, and you may need two to five treatments before you get rid of the varicose veins.
No chemicals or incisions are made, but the laser can be painful nonetheless.

, For this treatment, lasers or radio waves are used to damage the vein with powerful heat. That varicose vein then scars shut and fades from view. Deeper varicose veins called saphenous veins are usually treated with this method.Your doctor will insert a catheter, or small tube, into the problem vein through which a small probe is inserted. The laser or radio waves are transmitted through the tip of this probe, closing off the vein.
Healthy veins around the closed vein take over the flow of blood. Varicose veins on the surface that are connected to the treated vein usually close up shortly after treatment, as well.

, During this procedure, varicose veins are tied closed and removed from the leg through small incisions in the skin.This treatment was more common in the past but is generally only used for patients who cannot undergo endovenous thermal ablation.
You will receive anesthesia during this treatment, and the treatment will be performed in an operating room.
After the veins are removed, deeper veins will usually take over for the veins that are now missing, so blood flow should not be affected.

, This treatment also entails the removal of problem veins, but in this instance, the veins are removed via an instrument called a PIN stripper.Your doctor will sew the tip of the PIN stripper to the end of the vein. When he removes the PIN stripper, the vein will be removed, as well.
This procedure can be performed with general or local anesthesia, and it will either be done in an operating room or an outpatient center.

, For this treatment, small incisions are made to remove small problem veins close to the surface of the skin.Small hooks are inserted through small incisions in the skin. The vein is pulled out through these incisions.
Your leg will be treated with anesthesia, but you will not be put to sleep for the treatment.

,


This treatment is generally only used for varicose veins causing skin ulcers.
The doctor will make a small cut in the skin near a varicose vein. The endoscope, a tiny camera attached to the end of a thin tube, is inserted into the vein and pushed through. A device on the end of the tube seals the vein shut.

Be wary of home remedies for varicose veins.,
Try supplements containing horse chestnut.,
Apply apple cider vinegar.",How to Get Rid of Varicose Veins3," Home remedies or treatments may claim “unique” “permanent” or “painless” methods to remove your varicose veins. But they may not actually measure up to these claims. Always talk to your doctor about any health risks or possible side effects of home remedies before you apply them to your varicose veins.Some home remedies can interact with other medication, so ask your doctor if it is safe to take alternative remedies if you are on any other medication.

, This herbal extract can be an effective treatment for chronic venous insufficiency, a condition associated with varicose veins where your leg veins have difficulty returning blood to your heart. It may also help with swelling and discomfort caused by varicose veins.Do not use horse chestnut if you have liver or kidney disease or take blood-thinning medication or diabetes medication. Never take more than the recommended dosage. If you are allergic to latex, you may also be allergic to horse chestnut.Talk to your doctor before trying horse chestnut seed extract, and ask him if he can recommend any certified providers of this herbal treatment.

, While there is little scientific proof that this works, it remains a common folk remedy. The topical application of apple cider vinegar is thought to reduce the size of varicose veins.Soak a small cloth or cotton pad in a little bit of apple cider vinegar. Rub the vinegar over the varicose veins or wrap the cloth around your leg.
Let it sit on your skin for 30 minutes to maximize the effect.

Your doctor will examine your feet, ankles and legs, ask questions about your family history, diet and lifestyle, and maybe even take your blood pressure or send you for a blood test (to check cholesterol levels). Your doctor will determine if your cankles have a relatively benign cause (such as weight gain or edema from too much dietary salt) or if they are related to a health problem (such as poor circulation or heart disease). However, your family doctor is not a foot or circulatory specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.


Genetically, some women have naturally larger bones / ankle joints and thicker calf muscles, which cannot be remedied without invasive surgery.
Obesity obviously involves fat accumulation around the body, but the face, abdomen, buttocks and thighs are much more common destinations for fat deposit than the ankles.;
, If your family doctor thinks your cankles are related to a blood flow problem such as venous insufficiency (a vein condition that causes blood and other fluid to accumulate around the ankle and foot) then you may be referred to a vascular surgeon for a consult.If a hormonal problem is suspected (such as low insulin levels, which is indicative of diabetes), then you may be sent to an endocrinologist. If a heart problem is suspected (such as congestive heart failure), then a cardiologist might be the most appropriate doctor to see and treat your problem.


Vascular ultrasound is a painless procedure that allows a doctor to assess the function of the veins and arteries of your lower leg.
Podiatrists are foot specialists who may also be helpful in diagnosing ankle problems.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your cankles. If it's determined that you have no health issues and your larger-than-normal ankles are simply due to genetics and body type, then focus more on body acceptance and overall health, while being less concerned about something as frivolous as the aesthetics of your ankles. Body shapes and sizes can be changed somewhat, but only within well-defined limits.


Muscle fiber types and bone structure are inherited characteristics, so loosing weight and working out your leg muscles may have very little impact on your cankles.Research the various causes of thick ankles on the internet. It will give you ideas of potential treatments you can do at home, but always stick to reputable medical / health sites.

, Walking, jogging and cycling are all good exercises that force your lower leg muscles to contract. If you have poor circulation in your legs due to faulty or leaky valves within your veins (a common cause of venous insufficiency), then exercising your lower legs muscles can act like a second heart because they will squeeze the veins and help return the venous blood back into circulation.If you decide to jog, then run on softer surfaces (such as grass) and wear well-cushioned shoes or else you increase the risk of damaging or spraining your ankles and contributing to your problem.
Stretching your ankles and lower legs may also promote better blood and lymph flow.

, Fluid accumulation (edema) around the ankles can also be caused by peripheral arterial disease, which occurs when small arteries carrying blood to the legs slowly become narrowed or blocked from plaque accumulation inside the arterial walls -- a disease process called atherosclerosis.Without proper blood flow, the tissues of the foot and ankle don't get enough oxygen and other nutrients and become damaged. With time, the feet and ankles may become inflamed. Taking blood thinners (usually a prescription medication) prevents the plaque build-up in arteries and promotes better blood flow and blood pressure.Commonly recommended blood thinners include aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin).
Arterial plaque contains cholesterol, so maintaining a healthy blood cholesterol level may help prevent atherosclerosis.

, Compression stockings are available online, at medical supply stores, or maybe your medical specialist will give some for free if you're diagnosed with a vascular disease. Compression stockings provide support to muscles and blood vessels, which reduces edema / swelling and promotes better circulation.


Putting your feet up while resting, watching TV or sitting at the computer will help with blood flow from your legs due to reducing the effect of gravity. Laying down is even better.
Soaking your feet and ankles in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling.

, If your cankles are caused by obesity, then shedding some weight should also help to slim your ankles eventually, as well as improving your overall health status (such as a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke).Depending on your level of obesity, you may want to start with exercises that don't put too much pressure on your ankles and other leg joints, such as swimming or cycling. Once you bring your weight down to safer levels, add weight-bearing exercises such as walking or bouncing on a mini trampoline, which will also promote better blood circulation within your feet and legs.


Exercise regimens for obese people should be supervised by a healthcare professional.
Fat loss usually occurs from the face and abdomen initially, so be patient for the fat to be burned off from around your ankles.
Consider doing some leg exercises that increase the definition of your calves (such as stair climbing) without making the muscles bigger. The enhanced muscle definition may make your ankles appear slimmer.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercise, focus on reducing the number of calories you consume on a daily basis. Most people who are relatively sedentary only require about 2,000 calories per day to maintain their body processes and have enough energy for mild levels of exercise.Reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories daily will result in about 4 pounds of fat tissue loss per month.


Salads made with leafy greens and fresh vegetables are excellent choices for weight loss because they are low-calorie, high in nutrients and relatively bulky (high in fiber), so they fill up your stomach. Just remember to go easy on the salad dressing.
Drinking lots of water is great for weight loss because it's calorie free and helps to curb your appetite.

, If you're having trouble losing the fat deposits around your ankle, then schedule a consultation with a vascular or cosmetic surgeon in order to discuss fat removal via liposuction.Being invasive, surgery should be your last option to combat your cankles, not your first choice because of the potential convenience. In addition to liposuction, the surgeon may be able to shave or remodel the bones and muscles of the lower calf and ankle.


Make sure you understand all the risks of undergoing surgery, such as allergic reactions to anesthesia, infections and heavy blood loss.

, Diets high in salt tend to make tissues look puffy because the sodium within salt pulls the water from the cells into the surrounding interstitial spaces, creating a type of swelling called edema.The face, hands and feet / ankles are common areas affected by high-salt diets. Most processed foods are high in sodium, so focus more on fresh meats and produce.


Canned tomato sauces, salsas, crackers and pickled veggies are particularly high in sodium. Your daily sodium intake should be between 1,500 mg and 2,300 mg.A low-sodium diet recommended by many doctors is called the DASH diet., Pregnancy not only involves weight gain that may negatively impact your ankles, but also periods of poor circulation and changes in hormonal levels, which often promotes fluid retention in the lower legs. So if you're worried about your cankles during pregnancy, then you can certainly reduce your sodium intake, but simply wait until you give birth and see if your ankles go back to normal size.


Going on moderately paced walks and always raising your legs when you sit will help reduce edema in your ankles while you're pregnant.
Realize also that edema can come and go with a woman's menstrual cycle., Chronic alcohol intake can injury the pancreas and liver because ethanol is relatively toxic. A damaged liver doesn't work properly making enzymes and processing amino acids, which leads to edema (water retention) in the body.Alcohol is also fairly high in sugar-based calories (especially when combined with soda pop) without containing any other nutrients, which promotes weight gain. Beer can be particularly problematic because some brands are also high in sodium.


Consider switching to red wine, which is healthier for your blood vessels.Avoid eating the peanuts and pretzels that are served at some bars, as both are very high in salt.

, Long pants will cover your cankles and slim your legs at the same time. Wide-legged styles are best, as these don’t hug your ankles. Try to avoid skinny jeans and cropped styles that cut off right above the ankle.Long dresses and skirts also have a slimming effect. Just make sure they cut off at the ankle, not above it.

, High-waisted bottoms lengthen your legs, resulting in a slimmer-looking ankle. Try high-waisted pants or a long, high-waisted skirt., Chunky heels can make large ankles look slimmer. Stay away from stilettos, which are small and thin, making your ankles look larger in comparison., Ankle straps will only call attention to your cankles. Instead, pick shoes that cover your ankles, like high boots, or shoes with pointed toes, which help elongate your legs., If you don’t want to give up cropped pants or sandals with ankle straps, try accessorizing. Bold accessories, like handbags, sunglasses, and jewelry, will draw eyes upward and away from your cankles."

Take care not to overstretch your foot. You should never feel more than a small amount of pressure while stretching. If your foot gets overstretched, take a break from stretching for a few days.
Foot stretchers are available online or you can make your own. Take a sanded piece of wood (about two times the length of your foot) and use a glue gun to glue a sock around the circumference of the wood. Take a Thera-Band (which you can buy online) and tie it in a knot a fist’s width away from your sock. Slip your toes through the knot in the Thera-Band and rest your heel on the sock to stretch out your foot., Sit on the floor with your legs outstretched.

Get an accurate diagnosis and understand the cause.",How to Get Rid of Shin Splints," Shin splints are often caused by either running (or walking) too much uphill, on uneven terrain or on particularly hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete.As such, try altering your course and changing the type of surface you run or walk on — switch to grass, sand or a rubberized athletic track, for examples. Alternatively, cut down on your mileage and the number of times your workout per week.


Over-pronation (the rolling in of ankles) and flat feet are risk factors for getting shin splints.;
, Poorly fitting or excessively heavy shoes can also contribute to the development of shin splints. As such, wear stable, lightweight footwear that suits your sport or activity. Aim for no more than a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) heel. If you're a serious runner, replace your shoes about every 350 to 500 miles (560 to 800 km) or 3 months, whichever comes first.Remember to always tie your shoes tightly because loose shoes or flip-flops puts more strain on your foot and lower leg muscles.
Get fitted for your shoes by a shoe salesperson late in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches., If changing your routine and footwear doesn't make a positive impact on your shin pain, then consider switching to an entirely different activity that may be more ""friendly"" to your shin muscles, such as swimming, cycling or rowing. Then after the shin splints resolve (perhaps in a matter of days or a few weeks), slowly reintroduce running, walking or dancing back into your routine.


Swimming burns more calories than walking or jogging because most swimming strokes require the use of all your body's muscles.
Lifting relatively heavy weights with your upper body is a good alternative, and it also burns more calories than cardiovascular exercise.

, Weight loss may help prevent shin splints as there's less pressure put on the bones and muscles of the lower leg. For most women, consuming less than 2,000 calories daily will lead to some weight loss every week even if you're only a light exerciser. Most men will lose weight at under 2,200 calories daily.Switch to lean meats and fish, whole grains, fresh produce and lots of water for the best weight loss results.
Many overweight people have flat feet and tend to overpronate their ankles, which are risk factors for developing shin splints.

, Sometimes the best course of action for inflamed shin splints is to stop exercising your legs altogether. Because shin splints are often caused by overuse, common medical recommendations involve resting the legs for up to several weeks, but don't give up all physical activity and become a couch potato either.Focus on the lower impact exercises mentioned above until the shin pain disappears, then slowly reintroduce weight-bearing activities such as walking, hiking, and then jogging.

, Along with resting, icing your shin splints is a commonly recommended and effective therapy. Apply ice packs to the affected shin for 15 minutes at a time, at least four times per day for several weeks.The inflamed tissues of the shin are very superficial, so ice does not need to be applied for longer than 15 minutes at a time.


To protect your skin from frostbite, wrap the ice packs in a thin towel.

, Gently stretch your Achilles tendon (near your heel) and your calves if you have medial shin pain by wrapping a towel around your toes and then trying to slowly extend your leg while holding on to each end of the towel. Alternatively, gently stretch the anterior shin muscles (tibialis anterior) if your pain is centered in front of the shin bone by kneeling on a carpeted floor with your feet together and toes pointed back, then slowly sitting back onto your calves until you feel the tension in the muscles of your shin. Hold each type of stretch for 20 seconds, relax and repeat 5x daily.In a sitting position with your affected leg in the air, try tracing the letters of the alphabet with your toes. This is a good exercise that stretches all muscles of the lower leg.

, Soaking your feet and lower legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling.The magnesium in the salt is thought to help the muscles relax. If swelling is a particular problem for you, then follow the warm salt bath with an ice bath until your feet feel numb (about 15 minutes or so).


Always dry your feet thoroughly before you get up and walk away from your foot bath in order to prevent slip and falls.

, Get a massage therapist to give you a foot, calf, and anterior shin massage. Massage reduces muscle tension and inflammation, helps break down scar tissue and promotes better blood flow.Have the therapist start rubbing from the feet and work towards the knee so the venous blood is helped back up towards the heart. The therapist may also perform trigger point therapy, which is sustained pressure to the sorest spots within the muscle.

, A physical therapist can show you specific stretches and strengthening exercises for your lower legs, and if need be, treat your sore muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound, electronic muscle stimulation or microcurrent. Taping shin splints with medical-grade tape can help relieve symptoms by providing support for the muscles of the lower leg and also by reducing traction forces.Chiropractors are also trained to diagnose and treat musculoskeletal injuries of the limbs and they can re-align the joints / bones of the lower leg if need be.


Kinesio tape is a form of taping that has been clinically proven to decrease swelling and increase the range of motion.
Orthotics (custom-made shoe inserts) can also help with shin splints by supporting the arch of the foot and promoting better biomechanics when running or walking — they can be made by podiatrists or some chiropractors.Wearing an elastic compression bandage during exercising may also prevent additional swelling in the shin.

, High end running stores often employ people who are qualified to assess your gait, examine your legs and feet and check the wear patterns on your shoes. These people are not doctors, but they are usually experienced runners who can give you sound advice, which may reduce your risk of getting shin splints or help rid you of chronic shin splints.


You may be asked to jog over a force plate that's hooked up to a computer, or get videoed while you're running as part of the assessment.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncture for shin splints can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur.Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


In a 2002 study, acupuncture treatment (twice weekly for three weeks) was found to outperform sports medicine (physiotherapy) and the use of anti-inflammatories for the treatment of shin splints., If you develop shin pain that won't go away after a few days, and none of the usual treatments work, then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your legs and ask questions about your family history, diet, and lifestyle, and maybe even send you for a blood test (to check blood glucose levels among many other possible causes of lower leg issues, calcium imbalance, potassium deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, etc., and rule out the possibility of diabetes). However, your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal or circulatory specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.


Other types of healthcare professionals who could help diagnose and treat shin splints include osteopaths, chiropractors, physical therapists and massage therapists.
Your family doctor may recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin to help you deal with the pain and inflammation of shin splints.

, Shin splints are not considered a serious medical problem (although they can be quite painful and hinder walking), but there are some serious conditions that can mimic shin splints such as stress (hairline) fractures of the tibia, venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves of the lower leg), diabetic neuropathy, bone cancer, chronic compartment syndrome (swelling of the lower leg muscles) or popliteal artery entrapment.As such, a medical specialist may be needed to properly diagnose your condition, such as vascular surgeon or an orthopedist (musculoskeletal specialist).


Vascular ultrasound is a painless procedure that allows a doctor to assess the function of the veins and arteries of your lower leg.
X-rays or bone scans of the lower legs can be used to rule out more serious medical conditions such as bone cancer or fractures.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your condition. Obviously, conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or venous insufficiency have much different treatment protocols than a benign musculoskeletal injury such as shin splints. In most cases, changing your exercise routine or shoes and resting for a few weeks will be sufficient.


Shin splint pain is often worse in the morning after intense exercise from the night before.The pain of shin splints is often deep and achy and located laterally in the mid-section of the tibialis anterior muscle. Typically, one leg is involved and it's usually the most dominant one."

Select a powder.,
Remove the orthotic insert from your shoe.,
Sprinkle the powder inside your shoe.,
Rub the powder in.,
Re-insert the orthotic.",How to Get Your Orthotics to Stop Squeaking1," Several types of powder can be used to stop your orthotics from squeaking. Some good options include foot powder, talcum powder, and baby powder. Just look around your house and see if you have any of the above to choose from., Simply take the orthotic insert out from the inside of your shoe. Take a slightly damp washcloth and wipe off both your insert and the inside of your shoe.

, Take your powder of choice and sprinkle it generously inside your shoe. You will need to use more than you may think.

, Massage the foot powder around in your shoe. Focus on the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic contacts with the nylon or leather of your shoe. This area creates friction and is the most likely to make noise.

, Place the orthotic insert back into your shoe. Be sure that it is positioned correctly. Then, put your shoe on and take a few minutes to walk around on it. Hopefully the squeaking has ceased!

Soak feet in warm water.,
Remove calluses with a homemade scrub.,
Use a foot file to remove dead skin.,
Moisturize your heels.",How to Get Soft Heels1," Use your bathtub, or fill a container large enough to submerge your feet in. Soaking your feet in warm water will benefit your feet in a handful of different ways, such as hydrating your skin, soothing any foot pain, and getting them ready to be exfoliated.


Try putting some Epsom salt into your foot bath. Epsom salt is used for a number of conditions, but it can help your dry heels by soothing the dry skin and killing off bacteria or funguses that might be in the skin.Sit in the foot bath for at least 5 minutes. Stay in it longer if you have the time. The longer you let your feet soak, the easier it will be to scrub off dead skin when it comes time to exfoliate. Staying in a window of 5-15 minutes is ideal. But, don’t soak and treat your feet this way more than 3 times a week, as it could ultimately dry out your feet.;
, You can use a number of ingredients in your scrub, most of which you can find in your bathroom cabinet or kitchen pantry. What you decide to use in your scrub will depend on your preferences, and/or any allergies you might have to various ingredients.


Try a simple scrub with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) brown sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) honey, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix these ingredients in a bowl. After soaking, gently rub the mixture into your heels in a circular motion.You can also try adding a cup of milk to your foot bath. Soak in the milk and water mixture for 5-10 minutes. Make a paste out of 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of sugar or salt, and ½ cup of baby oil or coconut oil. After soaking, massage this mixture into your heels with a pumice stone to exfoliate dead skin away and soften your heels., If you don’t already have a foot file, they are easy to find in the beauty or personal care aisle of your local grocery or big box store. One side of the foot file will look a little bit like a grater, while the other side will have a sandpaper surface.


You can opt to file your feet while they are still dry, prior to soaking. Sometimes wet skin makes it more difficult to see the driest areas of your heels, so you can file your heels before soaking and scrubbing if you choose.Be careful not to file your heels too much. Once you notice the skin feeling smoother and softer, move on to another spot or your other foot. Over filing might lead to your skin being more sensitive, or prone to drying out again much faster. Avoid filing your feet more than three times a week.

, After soaking, filing, and scrubbing, you will want to make sure to lock in moisture on your heels. You can use a variety of moisturizers, whether you choose to make your own or use one you have on hand.


You can make your own heel moisturizer by combining a tablespoon of olive oil with a few drops of either lemon or lavender oil. Mix them together and apply the mixture to your heels. Wear socks to keep the moisture in as it soaks into your skin.If you have a bottle of moisturizer on hand, you can use that. Make sure you put on a thick layer, then let it soak in before putting on another.

Remove the orthotic from your shoe.,
Use hand lotion.,
Use anti-chaffing gel.,
Use food-grade silicone spray.,
Place the orthotic back in your shoe.",How to Get Your Orthotics to Stop Squeaking2," Just as with the powder method, the first step is to gently remove the orthotic insert from your shoe. Now it also a good time to wipe it off and make sure it is clean. Then select the gel, cream, or spray you would like to use.

, Distribute a few pumps of regular hand lotion into your hand and rub your hands together. Then, apply this lotion to the underside of the orthotic insert, paying specific attention to the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic connects with your shoe.Avoid petroleum-based products (like Vaseline) as these can damage the material of your orthotic.
If possible, opt for simple lotions free of fragrances and dyes.

, Runners, hikers, and other types of athletes often use anti-chaffing gels to prevent blisters on their feet. You can use this same type of gel to stop your orthotics from squeaking. Simply apply anti-chaffing gel to the underside of the orthotic insert, paying specific attention to the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic connects with your shoe.Anti-chaffing gel is available for purchase from outdoor equipment or sporting goods stores.

, Food-grade silicone is another great option for lubricating the underside of your orthotic inserts and stopping (or preventing) squeaking noises. Spray food-grade silicone into your shoe and on the underside of your insert., Position the orthotic insert back inside your shoe, and put your shoe back on. Walk around for a few minutes. Hopefully you will not hear any noise.

Remove the orthotic insert.,
Use tape.,
Use a dryer sheet.,
Use moleskin.,
Place the orthotic back in your shoe.",How to Get Your Orthotics to Stop Squeaking3," Just as before, remove the orthotic from your shoe. Then locate materials from your house that could be used to temper the friction of your orthotic insert. Some materials to choose from are tape (duct or packing), a dryer sheet, or moleskin.

, Tape can be an excellent choice because its adhesive quality assures that it will stay put. Packing tape or duct tape are great options. Simply take some tape and wrap it around the plastic edges of your insole, where it makes contact with your shoe., Using a dryer sheet is another good tactic. You can use either a brand-new sheet, or recycle one that has already been used for drying. Cut the dryer sheet into the shape of your insole. Then, insert the dryer sheet directly into your shoe. Using a dryer sheet has the added benefit of making the inside of your shoes smell like fresh laundry., Moleskin is a heavy cotton fabric available in craft stores. Sometimes, it is available with adhesive backing. If your moleskin does not have sticky backing, simply cut a piece of moleskin the shape of your orthotic and place it inside your shoe (as you would do with a dryer sheet). If your moleskin does have adhesive backing, stick it onto the plastic edge of your orthotic (as you would do with tape)., Insert the orthotic back into your shoe. Ensure that you have positioned it correctly. Put on your shoe and walk around. You should not hear any squeaking.

Get a pedicure at a salon.,
See a dermatologist or podiatrist.,
Purchase specialty creams, scrubs, or medicated balm.",How to Get Soft Heels2," Head to your local nail or beauty salon and get a professional pedicure. They range in price from anywhere between $20 to well over $100, so make sure you shop around and see which location offers something in your price range.


Different salons might use different products or offer different services. Do your homework and decide which salon offers what you’re looking for. Luxury day spas might over more extravagant pedicures, while your local nail salon might be a little less lavish, but still get the job done.
Wherever you decide to get your pedicure, make sure the salon appears to be clean and safe. Make sure the technician is certified or licensed, and uses sterilized tools.Don’t hesitate to ask your technician to focus on your heels while doing your pedicure. Let them know you have trouble with dry heels, and they will spend more time filing and smoothing them for you.

, If your dry heels are causing more concern than just irritation, you might want to seek out the advice of a dermatologist or podiatrist. A dermatologist can address skin-related concerns, while a podiatrist focuses specifically on foot health.


If you begin to have trouble walking without pain, have trouble standing on your feet for too long at time, or your at-home remedies are no longer working or effective, you might need to seek the advice of a doctor.People with certain medical conditions, like diabetes, can suffer from foot health problems. If you have diabetes or any kind of medical condition that affects your nerves, you will want to take extra caution and stay under the care of a doctor when tending to your heels., There are a great number of options for you to choose from when it comes to specialty creams, balms, and scrubs for your feet. The personal care aisle at your local drug store is the best place to check.


Read the labels of each cream. See which cream or balm best addresses your specific needs. Some foot creams are made specifically for dry or cracked heels, and will only be applied to this area.If you have sought the care or advice of a doctor, they might prescribe you a medicated cream. Apply any prescription cream or balm according to your doctor’s instructions.

Avoid wearing open shoes or walking barefoot.,
Adjust your diet.,
Keep feet clean and moisturized.,
Avoid taking very hot or excessively long showers.",How to Get Soft Heels3," You may have noticed that your heels suffer when you wear very flat and open-backed shoes, like flip-flops or sandals. When you expose your heels by wearing these shoes or walking barefoot, they are more prone to dryness, cracking, and irritation.


Walking barefoot or in open-backed shoes will cause your skin to callus to create a protective barrier on your feet. By keeping your feet in closed shoes, your skin will not have to generate this callused barrier.When possible, wear socks and closed shoes, like tennis shoes or sneakers. Not only will this protect the skin on your heels, but it will also help your posture and joint health by supporting your arches. , Hydration is important, but in reality, drinking more water won’t have much of an effect on your dry skin. Try incorporating more fatty acids into your diet. These are found in things like nuts, olive oil, and salmon.Studies show that increasing your intake of borage oil or flaxseed oil supplements can help increase the moisture in your skin, and relieve dryness. Try taking at least 2.2 grams (0.08 oz) of these supplements per day., It goes without saying that proper hygiene and cleanliness can maintain various aspects of your bodily health, but making sure you keep your feet clean is especially important. Keeping your feet clean will prevent any kind of bacteria or fungus from growing on your heels, and it can help reduce dryness.You might notice that when you wash your hands often, they dry out. The same can happen with your feet. So, it’s important to keep your feet moisturized in correlation with keeping them clean. After washing or showering, apply moisturizer to your heels and feet.Try applying moisturizer to your heels before bed and putting on a pair of thick socks. The socks will keep the moisture locked in your heels while you sleep. Doing this over time will help reduce the dryness in your heels.Most stores sell special socks for keeping your feet and heels soft. They come infused with lotion, or gel inserts on the heels. You might consider trying a pair of these to wear to bed.

, Staying in a hot bath or shower for too long can dry out your feet and heels. To keep this from happening, try not to turn the water temperature up too high, or stay in the shower for too long.Certain soaps you use in the shower might also be drying to your heels. Make sure you are using a mild soap, and consider trying a soap that has a moisturizer built into it."

Increase your lutein intake.,
Include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.,
Get plenty of vitamin A.,
Eat foods high in vitamin C. Vitamin C can help slow the formation of cataracts and the onset of macular degeneration.The following foods are some of the best sources for the nutrient.Oranges.,
Add zinc to your diet.",How to Strengthen Eyesight1," Lutein is a nutrient sometimes known as the eye vitamin. Consuming up to 12 mg per day of lutein can help slow the advance of age-related macular degeneration and other eye-related ailments. Foods rich in lutein include:Green leafy vegetables. Kale, broccoli, and spinach will all give you a good dose of lutein.
Fruits, especially kiwis, oranges, and grapes.
Squash and zucchini.
Alternatively, you can take dietary supplements for lutein. Make sure you take specialized lutein supplements rather than multivitamins- these only contain a very small amount of the nutrient. Keep in mind, however, that the body usually absorbs lutein more efficiently when it's from a meal rather than supplements.;
, These essential nutrients can slow macular degeneration, help prevent cataracts, and improve dry eye symptoms. The best source for omega-3's is oily fish, especially salmon and sardines. They are also found in tuna, mackerel, and oysters.If you don't like or don't have access to seafood, you could also take a fish oil supplement to increase your intake of omega-3's.

, This vitamin helps improve your vision in the dark and prevent night blindness. Several foods are rich in vitamin A.Carrots. For decades carrots have been hailed as the food for good vision. They're packed with vitamin A and are a great food for maintaining eyesight.
Sweet potato.
Eggs. These also contain lutein, so include them in your diet for an all-around good food for your vision., Get your vitamin c from a whole orange rather than orange juice. That way, you can avoid the added sugar that comes from orange juice.
Yellow peppers. Just one large pepper will give you 500% the necessary daily intake of vitamin c.
Dark green vegetables. Kale and broccoli especially are high in vitamin c. With a cup of either, you can get an entire day's worth of vitamin c.
Berries. Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries are all great choices for vitamin c.

, Zinc aids in the production of melanin, a pigment which helps protect the eyes. This can help the eye resist damage and slow the onset of macular degeneration. You have several choices to add more zinc to your diet.Shellfish. Lobster, crab, and oysters all provide high doses of zinc.
Green leafy vegetables. Along with lutein, these vegetables will give your body a good dose of zinc.
Nuts. Cashews, peanuts, almonds, and walnuts are all high in zinc. They are easy to snack on throughout the day.
Lean red meat. In small quantities, low-fat red meat is a great source of zinc."

This can cause serious damage to your eyesight. For details on how best to avoid and treat digital-related eyesight problems, see Protect Your Eyes when Using a Computer.

, Sticking to a good diet won't only help improve your eyes with nutrients. A balanced diet will also help you avoid weight-related diseases like diabetes, which is the leading cause of blindness in adults. Talk to your doctor to find out what your ideal weight is, then use diet and exercise to stick as close to that as you can., Smoking can lead to numerous eye problems like cataracts, macular degeneration, and optic nerve damage. It can also cause diabetes, which damages the eyes. If you smoke you should quit, and if you don't smoke you shouldn't start., UV radiation from the sun can increase your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration. Buy a good pair of sunglasses that blocks out 99-100% of UV rays and wear them whenever you're in the sun. Look for an ""ANSI"" sticker on sunglasses to ensure that they meet American National Standards Institute guidelines and screen out the required amount of UV rays., Dirty contact lenses can damage your eyes and even lead to vision-threatening infections. By properly caring for your lenses you can protect your eyes from damage.Wash your lenses after every use with the cleaning solution your eye care professional recommended.
Wash your hands before handling your contacts. This ensures that you won't transfer any bacteria from your hands to your lenses. Also wash with a mild, fragrance-free soap. You could also transfer chemicals and fragrances onto your lenses and cause eye irritation.
Apply makeup after your lenses are already in, and remove your makeup after your contacts are out.
Never sleep with your contacts in, unless they are specially designed for extended use.

, Small objects can do a lot of damage if lodged in the eye. You should always wear appropriate eye protection during any activity where foreign objects or chemicals could enter your eyes. This will ensure that your eyes stay safe and healthy.Make sure that your goggles wrap around your head to protect the sides of your eyes as well.

, A solid 8 hours will rest your eyes properly and re-lubricate them. That way you'll wake up with refreshed eyes ready for the day."

Ask your eye doctor about eye exercises.,
Blink consistently for a few minutes.,
Trace a figure 8 with your eyes.,
Alternate between focusing on near and far objects.,
Focus on your hand as you move it towards your face.",How to Strengthen Eyesight3," Although there is doubt about whether eye exercises actually improve eyesight, some eye doctors prescribe them for people with particular eye problems. These include trouble focusing vision, a lazy eye, and crossed eyes.Ask your doctor if eye exercises are right for you, and he can suggest some exercises in addition to the ones on this list.

, While blinking is not exactly an exercise, it is necessary for healthy eyes. A common problem is that people working on computers or watching TV don't blink enough, leading to dryness and eyestrain. Take a break from your work and try blinking every 3-4 seconds for a 2 minute period. This will help re-lubricate your eyes and treat symptoms of eyestrain., Tracing patterns with your eyes will help strengthen eye muscles and can sharpen vision.Start by tracing a figure 8.
After you've gotten used to tracing the 8 in one direction, try reversing directions.
Then mentally flip the 8 on its side, making an infinity symbol. Trace this figure one way, then the other.
When you've gotten tired of the figure 8, you can try tracing other shapes as well.

, This exercise can help your eyes stay focused when you switch your focus to objects of different distances.Place your finger about 10 inches from your face. Then focus on it.
Then switch your focus to an object about 20 feet away.
Alternate between these two focus points every few seconds for about 3 minutes.

, This will help keep your eyesight sharp as you focus on moving objects.Hold your hand out in front of your face with your arm fully outstretched. Put your thumb up and focus on it.
Move your thumb back towards you until it's about 3 inches from your face, keeping your eyes focused on it the whole time.
Then extend your arm again and stay focused on your thumb.

Visit your eye doctor regularly.,
Check labels on all medications you take.,
Ask your eye doctor about prescription eye drops.,
Consider laser eye surgery.",How to Strengthen Eyesight4," You should get your eyes checked at least every other year. The eye doctor can give you a comprehensive checkup that will find any problems that could be damaging your eyes. It is very important to catch conditions like cataracts and macular degeneration early so you can undergo treatment. The doctor can also prescribe corrective lenses and give you advice on certain lifestyle changes that will protect your eyes.Be sure to inform your eye doctor of any health issues you may have, even if they aren't related to your eyes. Problems like high blood pressure and diabetes can affect your vision, and the eye doctor should be aware of your entire health history., Some medications have side effects or drug interactions that can affect your vision. If you notice a sudden change in your vision and take medicine regularly, ask your doctor or pharmacist about the drugs you're on. There may be a side effect or interaction that you weren't aware of., If you suffer from chronic eye discomfort or inflammation, there may be prescription options for you. For problems like chronic dry eyes, prescriptions like Restasis can help stimulate tear production.Bring up any problems you've been having when you visit the eye doctor and see if there are prescriptions you can try.

, LASIK is a medical procedure where a surgeon uses a laser to reshape sections of the cornea. This helps the eye focus better and improves vision. LASIK has a high success rate. It can be very expensive, however, and the results may not be permanent. Talk with your eye doctor to find out if this is a good option for you."

Make sure that you do not have a foreign object in your eye.,
Use eye drops or ""artificial tears."",
Remove your contact lenses.,
Make an eye compress to soothe irritated eyes.",How to Stop Watery Eyes1," If you have something stuck in your eye, it may be causing that eye to water. Do not try to pull a foreign object out of your eye with your fingers or tweezers. To remove a foreign object from your eye, you will need to wash your eye.


To wash your eye, use clean hands to hold your eye open under a gentle stream of lukewarm running water. You can also do this in the shower by allowing the water to hit your forehead and holding your eye open as the water runs down your face. Or, you can wash your eye with an eyewash station or an eyecup.Don’t rub your eyes if you think you have something stuck in them. Rubbing your eyes when you have a particles stuck in them may cause damage to your eye.;
, It may sound counterintuitive to use artificial tears for watery eyes, but you can actually use eye drops to stop watery eyes. Eye drops work well when your eyes are watering because of excessive dryness. Eye drops will help to moisten and lubricate the eyes, which will lead to a decreased production of tears. To use eye drops:Extend your head back and pull down your lower lid. Hold the eye drop bottle an inch or two away from your eyes. Do not allow the bottle tip to touch your eyes.
Apply three drops (or as many as your doctor prescribes) to your eyes by squeezing the bottle and letting one drop hit your eye at a time. Use artificial tears every four hours or as needed.

, If your eyes just won’t seem to stop watering, try removing your contact lenses. Contacts can make watery eyes worse while also potentially preventing eye drops from working. Talk to your ophthalmologist if you think your contacts might be to blame for your watery eyes.Follow your eye doctor’s instructions for keeping your contact lenses clean. If you use disposable contact lenses, never wear them more than once. Always dispose of them after use.
Never sleep with your contact lenses in unless your eye doctor says it is okay.
Avoid wearing your contact lenses when swimming or showering.

, Warm compresses help to remove crust from the eyes while also working to loosen up any toxins that might be blocking your tear ducts. They also help to reduce the redness and irritation that often comes with watery eyes. Run a washcloth under warm to hot water, squeeze out the excess water, and then lay the washcloth across your eyes. Lie down and keep the cloth there for five to 10 minutes. "

Undergo tests to measure the eye.,
Stop taking medications that may increase bleeding.,
Take antibiotic eye drops.,
Don't eat or drink before surgery.,
Opt for local anesthesia.,
Ask about the types of surgery.,
Choose the type of lens.,
Know what to expect.,
Book a follow up with your doctor.,
Take care of your eye(s).",How to Survive Cataract Surgery," Once it's determined that your vision problem is because of a cataract(s), you'll be asked by your doctor to undergo tests about a week or so before the surgery.Typically your ophthalmologist will perform a painless ultrasound test (called an A-scan) in order to measure the size and shape of your eye(s) so they can determine the right type and size of lens implant to use during surgery.


The curve of your cornea can also be measured with a technique called keratometry.
It's easy to detect cataracts, even with the naked eye, because the lens of the eye looks cloudy or opaque and eventually obscures the color of the person's eyes.
Cataracts often develop in both eyes at the same time, although one eye may be more advanced and have worse vision than the other.;
, As is the case with any surgical procedure, your ophthalmologist may ask you to temporarily stop taking any over-the-counter or prescription drugs that could increase your risk of bleeding during the cataract surgery.If that's the case, then stop taking certain medications at least a day (possibly two) before you're scheduled for the procedure.


Anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), some painkillers (diclofenac) and all blood-thinning medications (warfarin) should be stopped temporarily.Alpha-blocker drugs (Flomax, Hytrin, Cadura, Uroxatral) for prostate problems are also problematic because they can prevent your pupil from dilating properly during surgery.
Don't forget about herbal supplements. Ginkgo biloba, garlic pills, ginger, Asian ginseng, feverfew and saw palmetto should also be discontinued for a few days because the tend to ""thin"" the blood too.

, Your ophthalmologist may also recommend that you take preventative action by using antibiotic eye drops starting a couple of days prior to surgery.Antibiotic eye drops significantly reduce the risk of a bacterial infection developing after surgery when your body's immune system is slightly weakened or over-worked. These eye drops are prescribed and don't typically cause any stinging or irritation in your eyes.


Add a few drops to each eye (even if you only have a cataract in one eye) 3x daily, particularly just prior to leaving home for your surgical appointment.
If you aren't prescribed antibiotic eye drops for some reason (allergy?), there are natural ways to kill bacteria in your eye. Consider using saline solution (salt water), colloidal silver or diluted hydrogen peroxide (3% solution diluted 50/50 with distilled water).

, Another common recommendation for virtually any type of surgery is to not eat food or drink any beverages about 12 hours prior to the procedure.The reason is that nausea is common with general and local anesthesia, and it's dangerous to vomit while you're on your back because you might choke. A little bit of water may be permitted, but avoid consuming everything else.


Schedule your appointment early in the morning so you can still eat something for dinner the evening before and not get too hungry.
Drinking alcohol is definitely a no-no because it thins the blood and prevent clotting, so avoid all alcoholic beverages for at least 24 hours prior to surgery.
Your last meal prior to surgery should be bland in order to reduce the risk of indigestion and heartburn. Avoid fatty, fried and spicy foods.

, Virtually everyone gets nervous prior to surgical procedures and are worried that it will hurt. Many are often squeamish about having parts of their eye cut out and replaced. As such, some people are tempted to ask for a general anesthesia so they're completely asleep during the cataract surgery. However, most patients can remain awake during the procedure and only need a local anesthesia, which carries less risk of allergic complication.Local anesthetic using sedatives, topical anesthetic drops or injections around the eye are used much more often than general anesthesia because it also allows patients to return to normal activities quicker — often within 24 hours.If you're given a local and a sedative, you'll remain awake, but feel groggy during the cataract surgery.

, There are two main ways of removing a cataract: phacoemulsification and extracapsular cataract extraction.Phacoemulsification involves inserting a thin needle-like probe into your eye's cornea to break up the cataract with ultrasound waves, and then sucking out the small fragments. Extracapsular cataract extraction requires a larger incision in order to cut out and remove the cloudy portion of the lens.


Look for an ophthalmologist that is experienced with phacoemulsification because it causes less damage to your eye. In fact, stitches may not even be needed to close the small incision on your cornea.
In contrast, the larger incision needed with extracapsular cataract extraction requires stitches and a longer recover time, as well as slightly greater risks of complications, such as excessive bleeding and infection.
Regardless of type of procedure, cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure and typically takes less than an hour to perform. If you have cataracts in both eyes, you'll likely have 2 separate procedures spaced a few months apart.

, There are different types of lenses that are implanted during cataract surgery. The lens implant, called an intraocular lens or IOL, is made of either rigid plastic, acrylic or flexible silicone.If it's appropriate for your case, choose a flexible type of IOL because they can be fit through a small incision that requires few or no stitches to close, which reduces recovery time. Ask your doctor about all your options.


In contrast, rigid plastic IOLs need a larger incision and more stitches to close, which increases recovery time and risk of complications.
The type of IOL depends on the size and shape of your eyeball, the size of the cataract and the doctor's preference for using certain materials.
Ask your surgeon about available options for IOLs. Some types are made to block out UV radiation, whereas others work like bifocals (provide near and distant vision).
In general, an IOL significantly improves vision, although it doesn't often correct for near or farsightedness.

, After your cataract surgery, you should expect your vision to significantly improve within a few days.Directly after surgery, your vision will be blurry, but clarity returns pretty quickly — especially if you get phacoemulsification surgery with a flexible IOL that requires no stitches. You may be asked to wear a protective eye patch or shield for a day or so.


If you get a local instead of a general anesthetic, most people are able to resume normal activities within 24 hours, although it may take another day or two to be able to see well enough to drive a car or read a book.
After leaving the operating room, you will be given different types of eye drops to take (antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and/or moisturizing types). You'll likely need to take the drops for a week or two.
It's normal to experience mild discomfort, itching and some fluid discharge from your eye for a few days after cataract surgery. If your symptoms persist or get worse than see your doctor immediately.

, To avoid complication and unnecessary side effects and truly ""survive"" cataract surgery, you should book follow-up visits with your ophthalmologist at regular intervals.Book appointments for a few days after your procedure and then again the following week and following month.


You doctor will examine your eye and make sure recovery is normal and that there's no signs of infection, excessive inflammation or vision issues.
Vision problems after cataract surgery are rare, but can include temporary loss of vision, double vision and increased eye pressure.If your recovery goes as planned, your eye will be completely recovered within 8 weeks — although your vision will be back to normal within a week.

, Within the first few weeks after cataract surgery, be conscientious of not damaging your eye. For example, when you get home after surgery, avoid bending over and lifting heavy objects for a few days because it'll increase pressure within the eye and increase healing time. Avoid rubbing or pushing on your eye in any way and consider wearing a protective shield when you sleep for a few weeks.Use your eye drops multiple times per day during your recovery period, as instructed by your doctor.
To ease discomfort immediately after surgery, take over-the-counter painkillers such as acetaminophen instead of anti-inflammatories (aspirin, ibuprofen) as they ""thin"" the blood and can trigger bleeding.
Avoid getting any water (from pools, lakes, rivers), dirt or dust in your eye, which can increase the risk of infection.
Signs of infection to look out for include eye pain, swelling, discharge of pus, nausea and a mild fever. If antibiotic drops don't combat the symptoms, see your doctor immediately.

Opt for brightly colored produce.,
Add at least one fruit or vegetable to every meal.",How to Eat More Foods Rich in Antioxidants1," Fruits and vegetables rich in colors like blue, purple, red, orange, yellow, and green often pack the most nutrients and antioxidants.


Among the best sources are berries, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, watermelon, cherries, broccoli, and red cabbage.;
,


Try a few grapes and a slice of cantaloupe with breakfast, a kiwi or apple with a sandwich of tomato and avocado for lunch, and a plate of skin-on Russet potatoes and artichoke as sides for dinner.
If you prefer only one fruit or vegetable per meal, make your morning and afternoon snacks carrot sticks, orange slices, sliced red bell pepper, or a small handful of dried plums.

Talk to your doctor about antihistamine for watery eyes caused by allergies.,
Ask your doctor about antibiotics.,
Consider the medications you are taking.,
Discuss other possibilities with your doctor.,
Discuss procedures with your eye doctor.",How to Stop Watery Eyes2," Sometimes watery eyes are caused by an allergic reaction. Taking an antihistamine, or allergy pill, can help to reduce the eye irritation caused by allergies. Just keep in mind that if your watery eyes are not caused by allergies, then the antihistamine might not do anything to help. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure about whether your watery eyes are the result of allergies.


The most common antihistamine drug is the capsule form of diphenhydramine, which is taken orally. For adults, 25 to 50 milligram of diphenhydramine should be taken every four to six hours. If it causes gastric irritation, you can take it with milk or food.A major side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking antihistamines.

, If you go to see a doctor about your watery eyes, she may prescribe an antibiotic if she suspects that you have an infection. For example, bacterial infections respond well to antibiotics; however, if your watery eye is caused by a virus, the doctor might not prescribe any medication and will ask you to wait for a week to see whether the condition improves or not.


The most common antibiotic prescribed for watery eyes is tobramycin. Tobramycin is an antibacterial eye drop drug specifically made for eye infection. Use as directed by your doctor. Usually this means you apply one drop of tobramycin on the affected eye twice a day for seven days — once in the morning and once in the evening before going to sleep., Some medications can cause watery eyes as a side effect. Check the labels of your prescription medications and ask your doctor if you are not sure. If watery eyes is a lasting side effect of a medication you are taking, talk to your doctor about the possibility of switching to something else. Do not stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first. Some common types of medicine that may cause watery eyes include:Epinephrine
Chemotherapy drugs
Cholinergic agonists
Some eye drops, such as echothiophate iodide and pilocarpine

, There are a wide variety of medical conditions that can cause watery eyes. If you have not been able to determine the cause of your watery eyes, ask for help from your doctor. Some of the conditions that may be causing your watery eyes include:Blepharitis (inflamed eyelids)
Blocked Tear Duct
Common Cold
Ingrown Eyelashes
Pink Eye

, If you are having frequent problems with watery eyes due to plugged tear ducts, you may need to have an irrigation, intubation, or surgical procedure to clear the blockage. These options would only be required if other methods of clearing the blockage did not work and/or your watery eyes are chronic.Punctal dilation. If tears cannot properly drain through the tear duct openings, punctal dilation may be done. The ophthalmologist will apply local anesthesia on the affected eye. An instrument will be used to widen the opening of the tear duct so that the tears can drain properly through it.Stenting or intubation. In this procedure, the doctor threads a piece of thin tubing through one or both of your tear ducts. The tubing widens the opening of your tear ducts, which makes it easier for tears to drain. The tubes are left in for about three months. This procedure may be performed under local or general anesthesia.Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). DCR is a surgical procedure that may be required if a less invasive method does not work. DCR creates a new channel for tears to drain through. The surgeon uses the existing tear sac in your nose to create the channel. DCR requires the patient to be placed under local or general anesthesia."

Wear goggles to keep foreign objects out of your eyes.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Use your own eye makeup and other eye products.",How to Stop Watery Eyes3," Make sure that you wear goggles or other protective eyewear when working with chemicals, power tools, or around lots of airborne particulates, such as sawdust. These materials can become lodged in your eyes and cause your eyes to water. Wearing goggles will also help protect your eyes from large or small objects that might hit you in the eye and cause damage., Sunglasses shield your eyes from harsh UV rays that can cause your eyes to water. Sunglasses can also act as a shield against particles and other debris that gets swept up by the wind and could potentially blow into your eyes.Before putting on your sunglasses, make sure that you wipe off any dust that might have collected on them.

, One of the easiest way to pick up another person’s bacterial or viral eye infection is by sharing products like makeup, eye drops, or washcloths with them. Because of this, it is best to avoid sharing any product or item that has touched another person’s eyes."

Wash your face with cold water.,
Try submerging your face in bowl of cold water.,
Apply a cold water eye mask.,
Apply a warm, wet compress.,
Try lubricating eye drops.,
Use antihistamine drops.,
Use eye drops that constrict blood vessels.,
Ask your doctor about cyclosporine (Restasis) drops.",How to Soothe Tired Eyes and Wake Up1," Splashing cold water on your face doesn’t actually wake you up directly. Instead, this initially causes constriction or narrowing of facial arteries, so you are actually decreasing the blood flow to your face. This lack of blood flow sets off a nervous system reflex to become more alert and fight to get out of this environment.


Reduction of blood flow to the eyes reduces inflammation to the eyes.
Natural tears are produced when your eyes are closed during this period of time. With prolonged periods of being awake, eyes can become dry and tired. Strategies that increase eye closure reduce dryness and spread tear film.
Test the water temperature before splashing. The water should be cold but not freezing.
Splash the water at least three times to get results. Keep in mind, however, that you will only get slight relief from this method. Too few splashes may cause no change at all.;
, Intensify your cold water wake-up by putting cold water in a bowl and putting your face into it for 30 seconds. Take a deep breath before submerging your face in the water. Take your face out of the water as soon as you need to get air.

Blink your eyes rapidly.,
Place your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid.,
Avoid rubbing your eyes.",How to Remove Something from Your Eye1," When you get dust, hair, or another small foreign body stuck in your eye, your body’s natural response is to blink. Blinking rapidly may help move the debris, and allow any tears that may form to clear it out. The more you blink and get yourself to tear up, the better chance you have of removing the particle.


To blink, rapidly open and close your eye.
Although you may feel silly, the tears will naturally wash out the debris.
If you cannot focus enough to get yourself to fake cry, then you can also try yawning to produce tears.;
, If you’re attempting to remove something stuck beneath your eyelid, close the affected eye and gently pinch the skin of your upper eyelid. Pull the upper eyelid down slightly over the lower one. Roll your affected eye around in its socket. With luck, this motion will loosen and dislodge something in your eye., It is often instinctual to rub your eye when something has gotten into it, but this can actually be quite dangerous. If you rub your eye, the trapped particle might be pushed beneath your eyelid or scratch your cornea, known as corneal abrasion.If this occurs, you could suffer permanent eye damage, along with a lot of pain. Therefore, do not apply pressure or rub your eyes when removing something from your eye."

Without moving your head, draw these letters with your eyes.Imagine a horizontal figure eight or infinity sign in front of you. Trace the eight with only your eyes and don't move your head., Train yourself to blink more often to prevent dryness. Blink once every four seconds to spread tear film and to prevent tired eyes.

, Sitting in front of a computer or monitor for long periods of time can cause neck and back muscles to stay tense. Without any treatment, these muscles can cause secondary soreness or stiffness of the neck, headaches, in addition to tired eyes. Stretching or meditating, specifically with eyes closed, reduce dry eyes by lubricating eyes with natural tear film. Also, the techniques relax muscles around the eyes.


Stretching increases blood flow and oxygen to tense eye muscles, allowing them to relax.
It also de-stresses your body when paired with meditative breathing techniques.Stretching decreases irritability and improves mood, and soothes tired eyes.

, Exercise moderately to increase heart rate. This will, in turn, increase oxygen circulation, which can increase blood flow to your eyes.

Use a cotton swab or corner of a clean cloth to remove the object.,
Have a friend help you.",How to Remove Something from Your Eye2," Commercially available eye wash solutions are useful for dislodging something from your eye. Eye wash solutions differ in their application process. Some use indirect application by filling a small eye cup with solution, then covering your eye with the eye cup and tilting your head back. Other solutions use a direct method, in which you will tilt your head back, then drip or squirt solution directly from the bottle into your eye., If you have an eye cup (used for rinsing eyes), use that to wash out your eyes with cool, clean water. Otherwise, use a small bowl or cup full of water and splash the water into your open eye. You can also place your open eye under a gently-pouring faucet or shower to rinse it out., Gently pinch your upper eyelid and lift it up slightly from the eye. Slip the cotton swab or corner of a clean cloth gently behind the eyelid and slowly roll your eye toward the back of your head. Remove the swab or cloth and check to see if you still feel something in your eye. If you’re unsure, you could also check the surface of the cotton swab or cloth for something., If, after rinsing your eye with solution and/or water, you can still feel something in your eye, use a cotton swab or clean cloth to get it out.

Flush out your eye with water.,
Try saline solution.,
Use an eyewash.",How to Remove a Speck From Your Eye1," When there is a speck in your eye, the best and most natural way to get a speck out of it is to make your eye water. It might do this on its own since it is irritated, but if it doesn't, try blinking rapidly and frequently to make your eye water. Your natural tears will help flush out your eye and may pull out the speck.



Do not rub your eye to make it water. Whatever foreign object you have in your eye could damage your cornea or get embedded in your eye.;
, If your tears won't get out the speck, you need to identify where the object is. Ask a friend or family member to look for it in your eye. Hold you eye open wide and have them look for the speck as you look around. Make sure you look up, down, and side to side so they can see all the areas of your eye.


If you can't find it at first, you may need to pull down your lower lid and check under there. You can also hold open your top lid and check there are well. The speck might get stuck on the back of your lids.
If you are by yourself, grab a mirror. Hold your eye open and move it around and look for the speck as best you can., Eyelashes are made to help remove specks from your eye. Pull your upper eyelid over the top of the lower eyelid. As you close the upper lid over the bottom lid, roll your eye.

Look for the speck placement on the white part of your eye. Wet the end of the cotton swab with water. Hold your eyelid open with one hand and gently remove the speck with the tip of the cotton swab.


You can also use a clean washcloth or a soft, damp towel if you don't have a cotton swab.
If the particulate is on the cornea (the non-white portion of your eye), do not use a cotton swab to get it out. The cornea is very sensitive and you may damage it., If you can't get the speck out with a cotton swab or the speck in on your cornea, flush your eyes out with water. Have someone else gently pour a glass of room temperature water over your eye from the nose outward as you hold it open with two fingers. Check to see if the speck is removed after it is flushed once. If it isn't out yet, flush your eye one more time to try to remove the speck.


If you are by yourself, try a slower, gentler method such as an eyedropper or smaller cup of water., If you don't have access to clean water or you want to try a different method, try flushing your eyes with a saline solution. Take the saline solution and drop a few drops into your eye. If that doesn't get the particle out, try a few more drops.


Eye drops or artificial tears work the same as a saline solution. While holding your eye open with one hand, tilt your head back and squeeze several drops of eye drops into your eye to remove the speck., You may have access to a sterile eyewash, a product that is available over-the-counter from a drugstore or pharmacy. The solution will come with a sterile eye cup that you can use to flush the affected eye with the solution. To use the eyewash, fill the cup halfway with the eyewash solution. Bend over the cup and press it tightly against your eye so that it doesn't spill. Then, tilt your head backwards and open your eye. Roll your eye around in the socket to thoroughly rinse.Make sure you wash the eye cup after each use."

, Carbohydrates provide our bodies with energy, and come in the form of sugar, starch, and fiber. Healthy carbs are digested slowly, stabilize blood sugar levels, and give your body hours of energy. Healthy carbohydrate options are:Whole grain foods, such as cereals, pastas, and breads
Fruits and vegetables, especially apples, pears, and carrots
Beans and nuts
Potatoes and other tubers

, While many people tout the benefits of low-fat diets, our bodies do in fact need fat to function. The trick is eating the right fats, which can reduce the risk of heart disease and help prevent dementia. Healthy fats can be found in:Flax, walnuts, hemp, and many fish, which contain omega-3 and other polyunsaturated fats.
Avocados, seeds, and nuts, which contain monounsaturated fats.

, Historically, the rule of thumb was to drink eight glasses of water per day, where each glass was one cup (eight ounces). However, tea, coffee, juice, fruits, and vegetables all contain water that count toward your body’s daily water intake, so use your body’s thirst guide to determine how much water to drink: if you are thirsty, drink a glass of water.

, When deciding whether to buy a food item in the grocery store, have a look at the nutritional label to see if it’s worth the money and the calories. Remember that these values are based on a daily 2,000-calorie diet, so you may need to adjust this a little to understand how it fits into your daily requirements.When you look at a food label, pay attention to the serving size, and make a note of how that compares with how much you actually eat. If, for instance, you’re actually eating two servings of a food, be sure to double all the daily values.
A daily value of five percent or less is low. Look for foods that have a low daily value for total fat (including saturated and trans fats), cholesterol, and sodium.
A daily value of 20 percent or higher is high. Look for foods with a high daily value for fiber, minerals, and vitamins.

, The recommended daily minimum for these foods is five servings, where a serving is either half a cup, or a small piece of fruit (such as an apple, or one banana).Since fruits and vegetables are full of fiber and other nutrients, filling up on them can help you cut back on your consumption of other, unhealthier foods.

, Depending on your age, you should be consuming between 1,000 mg and 1,200 mg of calcium per day.One cup (250 g) of dried figs contains 300 mg of calcium, as does one cup (eight ounces) of calcium-fortified orange juice.One ounce of roasted sesame seeds contains 280 mg of calcium
One tablespoon (0.5 ounces) of molasses contains 135 mg of calcium
Four ounces of firm tofu can contain as much as 750 mg of calcium
One cup of cooked spinach contains 240 mg of calcium

, You should be eating between 25 and 38 grams of fiber per day in order to lower your risk of stroke, diabetes, and heart disease.In case you aren’t getting enough, try:24 almonds, which have 3.3 grams of fiber
A quarter-cup of raisins, which has 1.5 grams of fiber
Three cups of popcorn, which has 3.5 grams of fiber
A single orange, which has 3.1 grams of fiber

, On a daily basis, most people should be eating about 0.8 grams of protein for every 2.2 pounds (one kilogram) of body weight. This means that if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kilograms), you should aim for 54.4 grams of protein per day.Another way to think about it is to get between 10 and 35 percent of your daily calories from protein, which is about 200 to 700 calories per day, based on a 2,000-calorie diet.

, Roughly 45 to 65 percent of your calories should come from healthy carbohydrates. For a 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to 900 to 1,300 calories from carbs, which is about 225 to 325 grams.

, Total fat should account for no more than 20 to 35 percent of your daily caloric intake, and saturated fat shouldn’t make up more than 10 percent of your calories. For a 2,000-calorie diet:


This is about 400 to 700 calories from total fat, and 140 to 200 of those calories from saturated fat.
This is about 44 to 78 grams of total fat, including 16 to 22 grams of saturated fat.

, We do require small amounts of sodium in our diets, but too much can cause problems. Limit sodium intake to 1,500 to 2,300 mg per day, and stick with the lower end if you have diabetes, kidney problems, or high blood pressure.


One-quarter teaspoon of table salt contains 575 mg of sodium.One-half teaspoon of table salt contains 1,150 mg of sodium.
Three-quarters of a teaspoon of table salt contains 1,725 mg of sodium.
One teaspoon of table salt contains 2,300 mg of sodium.

, When foods are processed, they can lose vital nutrients and flavor, so fat, sugar, and salt are often added in to make up for this flavor loss. Low-fat foods are among the worst offenders, because they often have a much higher salt and sugar content to make up for the lost fat.


No more than 100 to 150 of your daily calories (that’s six to nine teaspoons) should come from added sugar.
Highly processed foods that often contain these hidden ingredients include frozen meals, canned soup, and low-fat or low-calorie foods.

, The easy part is knowing that you have to avoid trans fats; the hard part is identifying them. Trans fats can raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol, and may increase your risk of developing diabetes.They can appear in the form of vegetable shortening, margarine, and partially hydrogenated oils. Trans fats are often found in:


Processed baked goods
Cookies, crackers, and snack foods
Fried foods
Candy

, These meats, including bacon, ham, and sausage, hot dogs, canned meat, salami, and corned beef and beef jerky, are chock-full of sodium and preservatives, and they’ve recently been added to the World Health Organization’s list of known carcinogens. Any meat can be considered processed if it’s been cooked or treated to extend its shelf-life or improve flavor, so this includes any meat that’s been:Cured
Smoked
Preserved with salt or other preservatives

, Whereas fresh fruits, veggies, and whole grains are great healthy carbs, the unhealthy ones you want to avoid include white flour and rice, non-whole grains, and refined sugar.


Juices, sodas, and other flavored drinks are packed full of added sugar. If you are thirsty, drink water.
Sugar comes in many forms (such as honey, agave, and molasses) and has many names. On an ingredients list, look for glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, syrup, cane juice, and dextrose., Making positive dietary and lifestyle changes can be difficult, especially if you overwhelm yourself with too much change at once. Sticking with your healthy choices is just as important as making them in the first place, so start with baby steps and expand your goals as you succeed with the smaller changes.


For instance, just start by adding a single salad per day to your diet.Once you get used to the daily salad, try adding fruit or berries to your morning breakfast, and slowly add more healthy foods to each meal.

, One of the biggest parts of healthy eating is decreasing the amount of unhealthy food you consume as you increase the number of healthy food choices you make.


For satisfying snacks, try crunchy fruits and vegetables like carrots, celery, apples, and nuts instead of potato chips and crackers.To deal with a sweet tooth, replace candy and baked goods with fruit, peanut butter, and sweet veggies.
For carb-lovers, exchange baked goods, pizzas, and pastries for soy, nuts, seeds, potatoes, and beans.

, This includes all food, healthy and otherwise. Don’t eat when you aren’t hungry, and stop eating when you feel yourself getting full. A key to this is eating slowly, which gives your body time to start the digestion process so that your brain will actually register that you’re full before you’ve already eaten too much.


If you are worried about wasting food, just pack up your leftovers and save them for tomorrow.
Not-so-healthy snacks and junk are also acceptable in moderation. There’s nothing wrong with splurging once in a while, and it may actually make it easier to eat properly most of the time (if you know you can have that piece of pie now and then, you won’t go crazy thinking about it all the time!)

, Healthy eating isn’t just about eating the right foods and avoiding the wrong ones: it’s also about eating the proper quantities of food. It doesn’t help that restaurant portions are often double or triple the size of real portions.


At home, divide food into proper portions before storing it (this is also important with snack foods like chips).When cooking, use smaller plates to control your portions and make your meals look bigger.
An appropriate portion size for protein is about the size of a deck of cards, and a half-cup serving of vegetables is roughly the size of an incandescent lightbulb.When eating out, order appetizers instead of full entrees, request lunch-sized portions instead of dinner ones, or consider splitting entrees with a friend.

, They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and this is true for many reasons. For one, a healthy breakfast will get your metabolism going, give you energy for the day, and get your body burning fat. Aim for three meals a day plus a snack.


Breakfast should be the largest meal of the day (consume roughly one-third of your daily calories at breakfast),and aim to eat within 45 minutes of waking.The evening meal should be your smallest, and try to eat it at least three hours before bed time., Eating out, getting take-out, or using premade or processed foods is acceptable once in a while, but for the most part, try to cook your own meals from scratch. Not only does this provide a connection with the food you eat, it also allows you to focus on foods that are low calorie and packed with vitamins and nutrients.Home cooking gives you control over everything you’re eating and allows you to manage your portions. For instance, instead of eating added sugar in processed food, you can add natural sugar with vegetables like corn, sweet potatoes, and carrots., Especially if you struggle with will power and portion control, it’s best to just leave the junk food and snacks at the grocery store. If it’s not in the house and convenient to eat, you’re not going to eat it.


This can be difficult especially if you don’t live alone. If junk food is an unavoidable item in your house, keep it hidden in a cupboard or somewhere you won’t see it and be tempted every time you go into the kitchen.
To help control your portions, never sit down with an entire bag of chips. Put a single portion of chips into a bowl and put the rest away. The same applies for other treats and desserts.

, Many people find food enjoyable, and taking the time to sit down and appreciate your meal will make you feel more satisfied with what you’ve eaten. Turn off distractions like the television, put your work away, and take time to sit down and eat.


People who eat on the run tend to eat more fat, sugar, and processed food."

Diabetes is a preventable disease - in fact, all you've got to do to stop most diabetes from occurring is to eat right and get plenty of exercise! A sedentary lifestyle hurts in many ways - this is just one of those.;
, There is some controversy surrounding whether glasses or contact lenses weaken your eyes over time. Current medical knowledge suggests that they do not weaken your eyes, nor do they improve the eyes themselves. Contacts and eyeglasses are simply tools that can help you see better - nothing more, nothing less. However, they do tend to stagnate your vision which usually leads to worsening your current eyesight condition., You may discover that you need less and less vision correction as time passes.

Get an eye exam.,
Wear the lenses/glasses that are prescribed to you.,
Change locations.",How to Stop Squinting1," If you’re squinting even though there is adequate light without being overpowering, chances are there is something wrong with your vision. If it's been more than one or two years since your last eye exam, then it’s time to get a new one. Eye exams may not be free depending on where you live so consult your Doctor, family or friends as they may have recommendations.


Depending on your insurance, you may be covered for eye care as new glasses can set you back upwards of $500; however, there are also lower cost online distributors who will send low-cost glasses straight to your home after you send them your prescription. Ask your eye care specialist what options are available at your location.;
, Check your ego at the door and always use your glasses or contacts as prescribed to you. It’s easy to get lazy or vain and avoid having to wear them. Choose a pair of glasses that suit your style and facial structure and keep them close by so that straining (and squinting) is minimized.


Consider a bifocal lens if you find you are constantly wearing and removing glasses for different situations but consult an optometrist before doing so.

, If you squint because of difficulty focusing, move closer to or further away from the subject whenever possible. For example, ask to sit in the front of the classroom or boardroom if it will help you focus. You can also reserve your seat or come early to a movie or play if you know what row you need to be at for optimum viewing.

Bandage your eye.,
Look for a scratch or ulcer.,
Use antibiotic ointment or eye drops.,
Be aware of puncture.",How to Remove a Speck From Your Eye2," if you are unable to remove the speck from your eye, put a bandage over your eye and seek medical attention. Also see a doctor if flushing did not get the speck off of your cornea. If you keep trying to get it out, you may end up scratching your eye or hurting your cornea. Covering your eye will reduce the amount of light your eye is exposed to, making you more comfortable until medical attention is sought.


You can also cover it with a towel or soft cloth if you get an appointment immediately after your cleansing methods fail., If you manage to get the speck out of your eye but it still feels like something is in there, you may have a scratch or ulcer on your eye. You may also have a corneal abrasion if the speck managed to scratch the cornea area of your eye. All of these conditions may cause pain, irritation, and blurred vision. If this happens to you, see your doctor as soon as possible.The best way to know if you have a scratch or ulcer is to get a doctor to check it. There is a special solution of yellow fluorescein that the eye doctor will drop into your eye that will pinpoint any scratch or ulcer you may have on your eye., If you do have a scratch or ulcer, your doctor may prescribe you an antibiotic ointment or antibiotic eye drops to help heal it. These will also help prevent infection from settling into the scratch before it can heal.


Always seek medical advice before using any kind of ointment on your eyes., If you think the speck in your eye might have caused a puncture, seek medical attention immediately as this condition is an emergency.

A doctor will likely prescribe eye drops to alleviate the condition.Allergies can also cause twitching. Your doctor will recommend prescription antihistamine tablets or eye drops to alleviate the condition., If the twitching persists, a doctor might prescribe Clonazepam, Lorazepam, or Trihexyphenidyl, though none of these drugs have high success rates. A surgical procedure known as a myectomy is much more effective, however, it should be reserved for particularly serious cases., Although there is no science to support it, some people believe that biofeedback, acupuncture, hypnosis, or chiropractic care can eliminate an eye twitch.

Don’t worry.,
Know the causes.,
Know when to call the doctor.",How to Stop Your Eye or Eyebrow from Jumping3," Eye twitching is common and usually not a serious condition. Most cases of “benign essential blepharospasm” disappear without ever being treated or diagnosed. Because stress is one of the causes of eye twitching, worrying about it will only be counterproductive., Unfortunately, there is no direct way to stop eye twitching. You will need to diagnose the cause of your twitching and then eliminate to calm your overactive lids.

Adjust the light of the room.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Wear a hat or visor.,
Use eye black.",How to Stop Squinting2," A lot of the time squinting is caused by the amount of light we are taking in. If you are able, adjust the brightness settings of available light sources. For example, change the type of bulb in your office or home to a lower wattage.


It may be difficult to change the lighting in your office so it is best to consult your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department before attempting to make any changes yourself.
If you are squinting when reading an electronic device, check the settings if it is possible to adjust the brightness settings. For example, televisions and mobile phones can easily be adjusted within the settings menu.

, The most common reason for squinting is due to the brightness of the sunshine. If you are squinting outside on a bright sunny day, a pair of quality sunglasses may solve or reduce the problem. Research what brands offer as some brands focus on fashion while others on function.


Make sure the glasses block at least 99% of ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Budget how much you are willing to spend on sunglasses as some can reach upwards of $500. If you are liable to lose them, think about choosing a pair of sunglasses that fit within your means.
If you are more active, choose a pair of sunglasses that won’t fly off your face easily. You can also purchase accessories to keep them in place or to turn your everyday glasses into sunglasses by simply clipping onto the frame.

, The brim of a hat or visor provides temporary shade by cutting the amount of light entering into your eyes. Choose a hat or visor that’s comfortable and suits your style. A baggy hat may fly off when windy; in contrast, a hat that is too small may cut off circulation and cause you discomfort.


Many hats can be adjusted or come in different sizes. Make sure you choose one right for your head shape.
Some athletic hats are made of breathable material that wicks sweat away from the body, which may be a wise choice for humid climates or if you are prone to sweating a lot.

, Many individuals who play sports outdoors or under bright stadium lights use eye black to reduce glare. Apply black strips or black grease underneath each eye to help reduce squinting. Be careful when using grease and make sure not to let it stain clothes or furniture as it may be hard to clean.Football players and baseball players famously apply this under their eyes so watch a game or research pictures for the correct way to apply eye black.

Identify squinting as a habit and not a necessity.,
Identify the cue that triggers you to squint.,
Evaluate why squinting has become a habit in response to your trigger.,
Think of a positive alternative action to replace your bad habit.,
Reward yourself when you don’t squint.",How to Stop Squinting3," Squinting can be a natural reaction to brightness but it can also be a habit that you have formed. Ask yourself whether you're squinting has caused any frustration, anxiety, or self-consciousness. Chances are that your social network has already mentioned something as they will notice it more than you because it may already have become ingrained.


Habits are formed automatically from repetition so identifying squinting as a bad habit means that you have to make a conscious effort to prevent it from occuring., Notice whenever you are squinting and evaluate the setting. Do you squint whenever you’re talking to your boss? Do you squint whenever you’re meeting someone new? Chances are there is a cue or context that brings about your squinting.Keep a journal to record when you squint. After a few weeks you will clearly be able to see a pattern unless someone has already pointed it out to you.

, Whether you developed squinting as a way to cope with stress and anxiety or simply out of childhood boredom, ask yourself why you ultimately feel the need to squint. There is always a strong emotion associated with whatever triggers your bad habit.For example, many people chew their nails because they are anxious so ask yourself what emotions you are feeling when you catch yourself squinting. The emotions may be hidden deep beneath the surface so take the time to evaluate the context. Talk to your social circle to get at the heart of the matter.

, Habits are difficult to break especially if you have been doing it most of your life. Once you know what triggers your blinking and what ultimately motivates it, make a conscious effort to replace the habit with something more positive.For example, if you squint when you are at parties because you are insecure that no one will speak to you, try smiling instead. This presents self-confident and open body language.

, Even if you only attempt to stop squinting, positive reinforcement will make each successive attempt easier. Whether it’s verbal praise or a material reward, remain positive in your pursuits.Rewards rather than penalties will make it easier to break bad habits.

Get them to relax.,
Use different lights and tinker with lighting diffusion.,
Use flash.",How to Stop Squinting4," Be aware of what makes people squint and keep the lights dim until absolutely necessary. Walk your subjects through the lighting process so they have time to adjust by either covering their eyes until ready or keeping them shut until the exact moment you are ready to take their picture.


Provide them until the count of three to keep their eyes covered and then take their picture the second they open them so as to avoid the few moments their eyes’ natural squinting reaction.

, If you are in a studio shoot, tinker with the type of lights in combination with diffusion to help reduce the brightness while still accomplishing the look you are trying to achieve.Make sure to keep lights off until you are ready to test or shoot. Lights can get extremely hot depending on the type and studio.


Using stand-ins can help with any fatigue your subjects may endure when sitting in a bright studio.

, Not only does a flash provide additional light but certain photographic flashes can be set to help the eyes of your subject adjust to different lighting conditions by flashing multiple times.Moreover, flash can also be used in sunny days so as to prevent your subject from squinting.When using flash on a sunny day, ask your subject to sit with the sun behind them and use the flash to brighten up their face. If the sunlight requires a shutter speed faster than the sync speed of your flash, use a smaller aperture, fit an ND filter onto the lens, or use a flashgun’s high speed function. Timers are an effective tool in coordinating photography equipment with your flash. Some flashguns have a remote trigger function that allows you to fire more than one flashgun simultaneously."

You may cause further harm by trying to remove the object from your eye on your own. Seek immediate medical attention if the object is larger than an eyelash or you experience any of the following:Nausea or vomiting
Headaches or lightheadedness
Double vision or impaired vision
Dizziness or loss of consciousness
Rashes or fever
Inability to remove the object from your eye
Pain, redness, or discomfort continues after the item has been removed from the eye;
, Hand washing helps eliminate pathogens such as dirt, debris, or bacteria from contaminating eyes. Use antibacterial soap with warm water and wash for two minutes. Wash under nails and in between your fingers as well.These precautions should be taken to ensure that bacteria, other contaminants, or irritants are not introduced into the eyes, which are quite vulnerable to damage and infection., Location of the foreign object can help you to determine whether the object has caused any damage to the eye. It is important to locate the object and not to attempt to put any instruments in the eye. Using other tools can harm your eye and may contaminate it as well.

, Move your eye back and forth in an effort to locate where the object is. Move your eye from left to right, as well as from top to bottom. It might be difficult to observe your eye while doing this. After you've moved your eye around, take a look at it in the mirror and see if you can locate where the foreign object is.Turn your head left and right and tip it up and down to move your eye while looking at it in a mirror.
Use your fingers to pull your own eyelid down and then look up slowly.
Repeat the process, except this time pulling your eyelid up and looking down.
If it is difficult for you to see anything, then have someone else do the inspection for you., Before you attempt to remove a foreign object from your eyes, it is important to know what to avoid. Keep the following information in mind as you attempt to remove an object from your eye:Never remove any piece of metal, large or small, that has lodged itself in the eye.
Never put any pressure on the eye itself in an effort to dislodge the object.
Never use tweezers, toothpicks, or other hard items to remove an object from your eye., Using a sterile eye wash solution to flush out your eyes is the best way to remove a foreign object or chemical irritant from your eyes.The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recommends flushing your eyes with water for at least fifteen minutes.Use a sterile eye wash solution to rinse eyes using a continuous stream of fluid.


Keep in mind that eye wash solution does not neutralize many chemicals. It just dilutes them and washes them away. For this reason, you will need a large quantity of eye wash solution., If you are at home and you have a small foreign object in your eye such as an eyelash or piece of dirt, then you can try to flush it with gentle running water in the shower.


Do not aim the water right at your eye. Instead, allow the water to hit your forehead and run down your face over your eyes.
Hold the affected eye open with your fingers to allow water to run over it.
Allow the water to run over your eye for a couple of minutes to see if it removes the foreign object from your eye., The amount of time that you will need to rinse your eyes will vary based on the type of irritant or chemical that is in your eye. If you have a piece of something stuck in your eye, then you will need to wash until you feel it come out. If you have a chemical irritant in your eye as well, then you will need to rinse for a certain amount of time depending on the chemical.


For mildly irritating chemicals, rinse for five minutes.
For moderate-to-severe irritants, rinse for at least 20 minutes.
For non-penetrating corrosives such as acids, rinse for 20 minutes.
For penetrating corrosives such as alkalis, rinse for at least 60 minutes., If the foreign object does not come out of your eye after a few minutes of rinsing or if you have gotten a severe irritant in your eye as well, then tell another person right away. Have someone call poison control and seek medical attention immediately.

, In some cases, like if you've introduced a serious irritant or contaminant to your eye, you shouldn't bother with sterile eye washes. Instead, your focus should be on immediately and thoroughly washing your eyes, then getting medical help.For example, if you accidentally splash your eyes with a chemical that is an acid, an alkaline (base), a corrosive, or some other kind of irritant, then stop what you're doing and flush your eyes with water right away.
Keep in mind that some chemicals react adversely with water. For example, most of the alkali metals (the furthest-left column in the periodic table) react violently with water. Don't flush these chemicals with water.

, Most places where you can may splash dangerous chemicals in your eye will come equipped with special eye wash stations. If you get a foreign object or chemical in your eye(s), go to the eye wash station right away and then:


Depress the lever. The lever should be brightly marked and easy to find.
Place your face in front of the water spouts. These spouts will spray water in your eyes at a low pressure.
Keep your eyes as wide-open as possible. Use your fingers to keep your eyes open as you rinse them.

, If you can't immediately find an eye wash station or you're somewhere where there are no eye wash stations (like at home), you can use the running water from your sink instead. Tap water isn't ideal for eye washing, as it's not as sterile as the purified water used in many laboratories. But it is far more important to rinse the chemicals from your eyes than it is to worry about possible infections.To wash out your eyes using the sink:


Go to the nearest sink and turn the cold water on. If it is very cold, then you may want to adjust it until the temperature is lukewarm.
Then, lean over the sink and splash water into your open eyes. If your sink has an adjustable faucet, point it directly into your eye at a low pressure and hold your eyes open with your fingers.
Rinse your eyes for at least 15 to 20 minutes., After you have washed out your eyes, you should call the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222 for advice. If possible, have someone call for you while you are rinsing out your eyes. Then, seek medical attention immediately.If you've introduced a dangerous chemical into your eyes, you need to get medical attention as soon as possible, even if you've already rinsed your eyes.

Cover your eyes.,
Increase your Omega fatty acids and water intake.Since tears are made up of water, mucous, and fat, increasing oils and water can moisturize your eyes.Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to help tear integrity, increasing tear stability.,
Blink often.,
Know when to see your eye doctor or physician.",How to Relieve Eye Strain," This can revive strained eyes. Run cold sterile water over a small towel that will fit over both your eyes. Be sure to completely wring the water out of the towel, then fold or roll it lengthwise to cover your eyes. Lay down and place the towel over your eyes for two to seven minutes. You can repeat this as often as you like.


You can also use cold compresses (like ice) or tea bags on your eyes. Tea bags contain tannins that can help constrict vessels, relieving puffy eyes from eye strain.
Avoid laying cucumber slices over your eyes, since they could cause bacterial contamination.
If you'd like to relax even more, add a few drops of rosewater or lavender oil to the eye mask or massage them onto your eyelids before applying the mask.;
, Turn off any harsh lights, extra lights, or fluorescent light bulbs. These can make your eyes work harder to adjust and long exposure to bright light will overstimulate your eyes and body. This can lead to irritability and overall fatigue. Create a comfortable lighting environment by changing your bulbs to soft/warm varieties. Use dimmer switches to adjust the level of lighting, which can then be personalized by everyone in your household.Natural lighting can cause a glare on the computer monitor, increasing eyestrain. Be sure to use an anti-reflective screen to reduce glare., If you work or study for long periods of time in front of a computer monitor or screen,make sure the monitor is not too close to your eyes. Adjust the settings for brightness and contrast until you're comfortably viewing the screen. Some websites offer tools to help you make these adjustments.The brightest light should be at the sides of the monitor. Any harsh light should form a 90° with your monitor to lessen the bright light hitting your eyes.


Reduce glare on your screen by closing blinds., The color should be appropriate for your environment's lighting. Avoid bluish light, which can cause eye fatigue because your eye is constantly adjusting to match it.Instead, make sure the lighting in your room is similar to that of your monitor. Choose soft lights with limited natural light.


You should also adjust any flickering caused by a monitor's backlight. Your eye must constantly adjust to the flickering, leading to eye strain. If you can't fix the flickering, replace the monitor to solve your eye strain., You can actually strengthen the muscles surrounding your eyes, just as you can other muscles in your body. Strengthen your eyelids after working on the computer or as breaks between work. Close your eyes halfway down, paying attention to the constant trembling of your upper lids. This is a normal reaction from your eyes when you're not blinking.Concentrate your efforts on stopping this trembling for about 5 seconds.


Lowering your eyelids halfway and focusing on stopping the trembling will make you squint, which can actually relieve eyestrain. Squinting temporarily reduces your pupil size and helps bend light easier so you can see better.
Avoid squinting constantly, which can lead to headaches and more eyestrain., Once your eyelids are halfway lowered, slowly close them the rest of the way and relax your eyelids. Take a few breaths as you do this to increase the oxygen in your blood, as well as increase your overall circulation.When you inhale, imagine the breezy oxygenated air coming through your nose into the eyes. Exhale through your mouth. Repeat this for one to two minutes.


The purpose of this exercise is to relax your eyes and strengthen the lids., Try focusing on objects at different distances, to get some relief from eyestrain. Take small breaks to focus your eyes and remind yourself to blink, which will hydrate the eyes. Practice focusing by holding a pen at arm's length. Focus on the tip of the pen while slowly bring the pen closer to your nose at a steady pace.Do about 5 to 10 repetitions and mix it up by focusing on things that are far away as well as close.This lets your eyes relax from any previous strain.


Focusing improves your vision, puts less strain on the eyes, and may help a twitch caused by a tired eye. When eyes have better visual acuity or are able to see with ease, less strain is put on the eyes, so eyes have less trouble adapting to typical focusing issues., Do this if your eyes feel strained because you've been looking a computer screen, reading, or doing other work requiring concentration. Try looking at the tip of your nose, then at an object that's about arm's length or 20 feet away, and look back to the tip of your nose. Repeat this 10 times. Try to change your focus every 15 to 30 minutes by looking in another direction.


Choose objects at different distances when you give your eyes a break. Or, you could also give your eyes a rest by getting up from the computer and walking around for a minute., A major cause of eye strain are dry eyes. Tears are made up of 3 layers: oil/lipid (fat), water, and mucus layers. A problem with any of these layers can cause dry eyes. Once you understand what each layer does, you can narrow down potential problems that are causing your dry eyes. For example, a tear with not enough proteins to fight off bacteria can be dry due to irritation from chronic infections. The parts of the tear have the following functions:Mucous layer: This lowest layer is the base of the tear which gives stability, helping it stick to the eye. This layer keeps tears in your eyes, so they don't spill out.
Water layer: This middle layer gives needed electrolytes to tears to keep them strong. It contains bacteria-fighting enzymes and proteins. The watery nature of this layer allows tears to quickly cover the eye.
Oil/lipid (fat) layer: This outer layer seals the tear layers and covers the entire eye with enough tear film to protect the eye.

, If your eyes feel dry after reading, knitting or staring at the computer for a particularly long time, use an artificial tear product. Since several brands are available, try a few to see which ones your eyes respond to best. You may need to combine more than one brand for relief. Realize that artificial tears aren't substitutes for natural tears; they simply relieve dryness by replacing the outer tear film layer. If you have chronic dry eyes, you'll need to keep using artificial tears even if your eyes are symptom free.Some things to look for include:


Lubricating ingredients called hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), glycerin, or polysorbate. These mimic tears because they have a similar surface tension which lets drops stick to the surface of the eye.
Preservative free drops which can reduce the risk of allergy or sensitivity of already dry eyes.Eye ointments which are useful lubricants during long periods when you can't use artificial tears. OTC eye drops, like Systane, can be used four to six times a day or as needed.

, Your eye doctor can prescribe medicated drops after examining the cause of your dry eyes.These medications are substitutes for tears. These medications, like Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Carboxy Methylcellulose, consist of an artificial tear and other substances to lubricate the eyes. These drops relieve the symptoms. But, you'll need to reapply them frequently, four to si times daily or as needed. If you're prescribed a gel, you'll need to apply it once or twice a day.Always follow your doctor's recommendations about dosage.
If you wear contacts, take them out before applying the drops. Reinsert your contacts 30 minutes after using the drops., Ointments are usually used to lubricate the eyes, but several types exist. Antibiotic ointment can be used to treat chlamydia conjunctivitis,dry eyes caused by diseases of the glands that make the lipid layer of tear film, or swelling from inflamed lids. Ointments are often used to lubricate the eyes during long periods of time when artificial tears can't be applied (like while you're sleeping).Common over the counter eye ointments are also available.You may need to try several before finding an ointment that effectively relieves your symptoms.

, Avoid exposing your eyes directly to air, like a car heater, hair dryer, and air conditioner. You should also take care to wear glasses when going out in the sun and goggles when swimming. Protecting your eyes can keep moisture in them. You may also try wearing special glasses that form a moisture chamber around the eyes. This can create additional humidity.


Keep the humidity level in your home between 30-50% humidity. Add moisture to the dry indoor air during the winter by using a humidifier.

, Omega 6 fatty acids help reduce inflammatory factors, reducing dry eye symptoms.Women are recommended to drink nine cups of water a day, while men should drink 13 cups of water a day., Blinking helps freshen your eyes by spreading tear film evenly throughout your eye. This can relieve eye strain due to dry eye. It's especially important to remember to blink if you focus on a computer screen or monitor for much of the day. Blinking every time you remember to, or remembering to take a break every 15 minutes can help relieve eye strain symptoms.The blinking rate for people focused on computer screens decreases by 66%., You should see your doctor if treatments aren't working, you have chronically tired eyes, or have alarming symptoms along with fatigued eyes. Keeping your doctor informed of your concerns will make it easier for the doctor to answer your questions or address issues you may not know about. For instance, you may be suffering from a more complicated disease that causes tired eyes as a symptom. These may include:


Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: This is a condition causing constant fatigue and vision problems which may be mistaken for tired eyes. Corrective lenses do not fix the vision changes (like blurriness) and eye exams are often normal. This condition requires medical care.Thyroid eye diseases: These can cause eye problems that may feel like tired eyes. Certain thyroid problems like Graves disease (where the body attacks its own thyroid tissue as well as eye tissue) can cause eye swelling.Astigmatism: This happens when the cornea is abnormally curved, causing blurry vision.Chronic Dry Eye Syndrome: This causes dry eyes because of systematic problems like diabetes or Sjogrens disease."

Locate the term power (PWR) or sphere (SPH).,

Get the right brand.,
Decipher a lens equation.,
Look for the term cylinder (CYL).,
Find your axis (AXIS) number.,
Understand the term add power (ADD).,
Ask your optometrist about color (COLOR).",How to Read a Contact Lens Prescription," When your eye doctor gives you the paperwork from your visit, she will hand you your prescription. This comes in the form of a graph or table in your eye care paperwork. Although this is the standard form, the terms on the columns or axes of the graph varies according to your doctor's preference.


Make sure you are looking at the contact lens prescription, not your eyeglasses prescription. This is to ensure you understand exactly what kind of lenses you are going to get. The two tables may include similar acronyms, but the numbers may differ.;
, The FDA requires that all contact lens prescriptions provide some basic information about the optometrist prescribing the lenses and the patient receiving them. They require the patient's name, the examination date, the issue date of the prescription, the expiration of the prescription, and the name, address, phone number, and fax number of the optometrist.


The information about the lens strength must also be on the prescription as well as any special instructions or brand requirements., Each contact lens prescription lists the necessary strength for each eye. On your prescription, you may see the term oculus dexter or the abbreviation OD. OD is a Latin term for the right eye. The term oculus sinister, or OS, means left eye. If both of your eyes require the same prescription, you will see the term oculus uterque, or OU, meaning that the prescription is for both eyes.Most terms on contact lens prescriptions are measured in diopters, a unit of refractive power that is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters of a lens. Diopter is often abbreviated as D., These numbers are usually the first set of numbers listed next to the OD and OS rows or columns. They indicate the strength of correction needed for that particular eye or, if OU is listed, both eyes.


For example, if the field under OD reads -3.50 D, this indicates that you have 3.5 diopters of nearsightedness in your right eye. If the field under OD reads +2.00, this indicates that you have 2.00 diopters of farsightedness in the right eye.It is common for the correction to differ between the right and left eyes. If you find the term PL, which stands for Plano, it means the number is 0 and no correction is needed for that particular eye., This term describes how the curvature on the inside of the lens should be. This is measured so the lens fits perfectly against your eye and fits the shape of your cornea. Unlike most of the other numbers, this number is measured in millimeters.


This number typically ranges from 8 to 10. The lower the number in this column or row, the steeper your cornea is., The diameter is the measurement of a straight line through the center of the contact lens. It lets the maker of your contact lenses know how big around you need your contacts to be to fit your eye. Like the BC, the DIA is also measured in millimeters.


This is a very important measurement. If it is off, your lenses can cause irritation or abrasions on your eyes., In the United States, your optometrists will always indicate the brands of contacts that will best fit your needs. Once they list those brands, it is the law that the retailer who provides your contacts must supply you one of those brands and no other.


Substitutions can be made for natural brands as well as private label lenses, which are those only sold by eye care professionals., Sometimes, your contact lens prescription can also be written in a simple equation form. The equation usually follows this order: +/- Sphere/Power +/- Cylinder x Axis, Base Curve' BC'= diameter DIA = number. For example: +2.25-1.50x110, BC=8.8 DIA=14.0.


If you are unsure exactly how to read your lens equation, ask your doctor to translate it for you.

, There are certain numbers that do not always appear on your prescription. If you are suffering from astigmatism, which is common, you will see the added column or row for CYL. This number is the measure of the amount of astigmatism you have, measured in diopters. Most doctors use a positive number, but if a negative number is given, a lens store may need to convert to a positive number.


This usually caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, but can also be caused by an irregularly shaped lens on the eye.
A negative number here indicates your Myopia (nearsighted) astigmatism and a positive number means you have Hyperopia (farsighted) astigmatism., The axis is the measurement calculated in degrees that is required to bend light to correct the irregular shape of the cornea. This is essentially the orientation needed for your CYL to work properly.This number will be a higher number, such as 090 or 160, depending on how slanted your CYL needs to be., Sometimes, it may be necessary for you to have contact lenses with bifocals in them. If this is the case, your prescription may have a column or row for ADD, which is the amount that the lens needs to be adjusted for the bifocal lenses.


This term is measured in diopters., There may be a reason your prescription includes the term color. This is a field that indicates if you requested a certain kind of contact lens to enhance to color of your eyes. This can also indicate a special kind of contact, such as ""cat eye"" or some other eye changing quality.


The special features available will differ depending on the brand you need. Ask your optometrist about your options based on your current condition."

Notice changes in your eyes.",How to Choose Coloured Contacts (Dark Skinned Girls)," Decorative colored contacts cover your iris in a new color. This can closely match your natural color to enhance it, or it can be dramatically different. Colored contacts will never look exactly the same on any two people.Opaque lenses are meant to entirely cover your natural eye color. If you have dark eyes, you might need to get opaque lenses in order to alter your eye's natural color.
Color-enhancement lenses are intended to shade your existing eye color. If you have light colored eyes, these lenses can brighten your natural shade or change it altogether. They may not have any effect on dark eyes, however.
Equinox lenses are lenses that have a dark ring around the iris. It's both a subtle and a dramatic effect, particularly in light eyes. It's subtle because it's not immediately recognizable what is different about the person, but it's definitely noticeable. These are sometimes called ""circle lenses"".
Custom-tinted or sports tinted lenses are increasingly popular choices. These are both cosmetic and practical, as the choice of color may enhance sports ability. Colored contacts can reduce glare, enhance contrast sensitivity and heighten depth perception. For example, a tennis player may wear green contacts in order to see the tennis ball more clearly.;
, Dark skin color can be seen in terms of ""warm"" or ""cool"". Cool means your skin has pink, red, or bluish undertones. Warm skin has undertones of yellow or peach. Some people have neutral skin, which is a mixture of the warm and cool.Is your skin tone more olive in complexion? If so, you have a warm skin tone. Do you look best in bright white, black, or silver tones? You might have a cool skin tone. You'll likely look best in brown, amber or green contacts.
If you have lighter skin, the best way to determine whether your skin has warm or cool tones is by looking at your veins. If your veins appear blue, you likely have cool tones. If your veins appear greenish, you likely have warm skin tones.

, Most dark-skinned girls have dark eyes, but not all. If you have light eyes, a subtle colored contact lens might be green or blue. If you have dark eyes, you might choose opaque colored contact lenses.Hazel or honey-brown lenses will be more natural on a dark eye. Bright colors, like blue, purple, or green, will make you more noticeable.
You can also choose to enhance the natural color of your eyes using colored contact lenses.

, After your skin, your hair will probably be the first thing that someone sees near your eyes. If your hair is dark, consider dark lenses, or dark colors like violet or dark blue.If you have a dramatic hair color, like platinum-blonde, or a combination of colors, you might want to choose a dramatic eye color as well. Consider opaque contacts in shades of emerald green or ice blue.
If you don't dye your hair, dramatic contacts may look even more dramatic. Try on different colors before making a final decision.

, Do you want to make a dramatic statement with your colored contact lenses? Or would you rather enhance your natural appearance? Using colored contacts can result in either effect. Bright colored contact lenses on naturally dark eyes will definitely make your eyes noticeable.
You might decide to purchase multiple contacts in order to try different effects for different occasions. For example, maybe you want to purchase one set of contacts for work, and another for night life.

, Wear your contacts in low lighting, and see how the effect of your colored contacts changes. The effect will be different in bright lighting. Move to different areas, carrying a hand-held mirror if you need to, to see how your new contacts will look in different lights.Consider where you're most likely to wear your new colored contacts. Are you planning to wear them out clubbing? Or are they for daily wear?
If you've narrowed your choices down to 2 different colors, try wearing a different color in each eye as you move between different lighting. This might make your choice easier.
Remember, you can always purchase more than 1 set of colored lenses for different purposes.

, Remember that contact lenses, even decorative ones, are medical devices. Even if your contacts don't require a prescription to help correct your vision, they should be fitted to your eye. Anyone selling contact lenses must verify your prescription by calling your doctor.Poorly fitted or cheaply made lenses are more likely to result in eye injury or infection.
Avoid ordering contacts over the internet, from a costume shop, flea market, or street vendor.

, Whether your contact lenses are prescribed to correct your vision, or whether they're decorative, your contacts will be one of many kinds. Most contacts are soft contacts, which means that they are flexible. Soft lenses allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea. Soft contacts are disposable, and can be worn for one day (daily disposable), 2 weeks, or 4 weeks. Lenses can also be hard, which means they are rigid and breakable. These contacts are also known as RPGs or ""rigid gas permeable."" Contacts can also be bifocal.
Even though contacts can be worn for many days, it's best to remove them each night as you sleep.
RPGs may be the best choice of contact lenses for someone with allergies.
Even though RPGs once had a reputation for ""popping out"" of the eye, newer models have greatly improved the comfort level and sustainability.
Soft lenses have a greater chance of sliding up underneath the eyelid, or getting folded while still in the eye.

, People who wear contact lenses have an increased risk of infection to the cornea. Wearing contacts in a way other than prescribed - e.g. wearing daily contacts for a week, or wearing them overnight - may result in temporary, or even long-term damage to the cornea.Soft, extended-wear contacts have the highest risk of developing protein build-up on the lens. This may result in lens-related allergies.
Infections often result from poor lens cleaning as well as misuse.

, Even though contacts are popular and easy to wear, there are still some hazards associated with wearing contact lenses. Eye infections, scratching the cornea, and allergic reactions as demonstrated by itchy, red, watery eyes are among the most common results from wearing contacts, even if you follow all the guidelines.If you choose to wear contacts, you need to also be able to commit to taking care of the contact lenses as well as your own eyes.
If you're wearing contacts as a decorative accessory, make sure your lenses are FDA-approved.
Anyone selling contact lenses is required to get a prescription from your doctor - even if you don't require prescriptive lenses! The reason for this is that contact lenses must be fit to your eye, and contacts that don't fit properly could result in damaging your eye or even causing blindness., If you're someone who frequently gets eye infections, has chronically dry eyes, or serious allergies, you may not benefit from wearing contact lenses. If you work in an area with a lot of particle matter in the air, you might also want to avoid contacts.If you're the kind of person who has a hard time doing the daily washing and caring for contacts that they require, you might want to avoid wearing contacts.
Wearing contact lenses means that you'll have to take them out in the evening. If you have a schedule where your evenings are greatly varied, you might want to stick to glasses. If you're planning to just wear decorative colored lenses, make sure you bring a case to store them in when your eyes are tired and you need to remove your lenses.

, Always wash your hands well with soap and water before touching your contact lenses. It's recommended that you clean your contact lens case every day, and change your case at least once every 3 months.Never share your colored contact lenses with someone else.
Homemade contact lens cleaning solutions have been linked to serious eye infections. Always purchase FDA-approved saline and cleaning solution.

, Take out your contact lenses and call your doctor if you start to notice signs of eye discomfort or distress. If your eyes start to hurt, itch, or become red and watery, you may have an eye infection or injury. If your eyes may become overly sensitive to light, or you have blurry vision, call your doctor.


Your eye may feel scratchy, as if there's something stuck in it. This can be an indication of a scratch on your cornea.
Always start by taking your contact out when you notice these signs.

Talk to an optometrist.,
Identify your fear.,
Perform a practice run.,
Practice not blinking.,
Look away.",How to Not Be Afraid of Contact Lenses1," An optometrist is a specialized professional who is the most qualified person to address your fears and concerns regarding contact lenses. She will be aware of issues such as dry eye, infections, pain or discomfort, and other potential pitfalls. The good news is, she also knows how to calm many of these fears and has solutions to protect your eyes from any serious disease. Make a list of fears and concerns to discuss during your visit.
Ask for a free trial pair of contact lenses for practice.
Request an eye exam. They are painless, a good idea, and good practice of what to expect next time you visit the optometrist.
As an alternative, talk to friends or family members who wear contact lenses and ask them what their fears were and how they overcame them.;
, Another important step to overcoming your fear of contact lenses is accessing the reason for the fear and finding out if it legitimate or not.Prior to ever wearing contact lenses, you might fear that something on your eye will cause pain or discomfort. Modern contact lens materials, however, are flexible, comfortable, and designed to properly fit your eyes. If you do experience pain or discomfort, talk to your optometrist about finding a more appropriate lens.
A popular urban legend cites terrible damage or even death occurring because a contact lens slid up an eye and entered the brain. Biologically, this is impossible because eye anatomy only permits an object on the eye to be removed from the front.
Eye infection is possible, but modern contact lenses, along with products that disinfect and protect them, makes it almost impossible to get an infection. If this still makes you nervous, then you might opt for daily disposable contacts so that you enjoy a brand new and clean lens every day.

, Try to get used to touching your eyes by practicing for several days prior to purchasing lenses. Not only will you become more confident, your eyes will start to desensitize to objects near them. Always practice good hygiene by washing your hands thoroughly.
Take your time. Begin by touching your upper and lower eyelids followed by your eyelashes, then the whites of your eyes. Gently tap your eye a few times to prove to yourself that there is nothing to fear.

, Our natural reflexes try to prevent objects from entering the eye so a little practice to override this reflex may be in order. The key, of course, is to relax and try not to think about placing an object in your eyes; rather, you are placing a lens on top of your eyes. Practice not blinking by placing your index finger on the upper eyelid while your thumb is placed on the lower eyelid to hold open your eye. Take your other hand and imitate putting a lens on your eye so that your mind and eye get used to this motion.
It is important to practice the same order repeatedly because contacts are designed specifically for an individual eye. This means they are not transferable from one eye to the other.
The helper hand, the one that holds the eyelids open, needs to be steady in order to prevent blinking midstream.

, It is not unusual to look away when inserting the contact lens. This helps prevent the fear of an object touching your eye. Using a mirror to insert contact lenses on your eyes will help take some sensation out of the process. Take your time and practice since looking into the mirror will reverse the image, making it a bit more difficult to skillfully locate where the lens should exactly go.
Sit close to the mirror and concentrate on the process rather than the actual lens touching the eye. Then, when the lens is near the eye, look up slightly and place the lens on the white part of your eye. Carefully slide the contact into the correct position to finish the process.
If the lens is not exactly in the right position, that's okay. Try closing your eye and then look up, down, left and right to position the lens in the right place.

Wash and rinse your hands.,
Put contacts on prior to applying makeup.,
Use recommended products to clean lenses.,
Avoid using tap water directly on contacts.,
Properly clean and store your contact lenses.",How to Not Be Afraid of Contact Lenses2," Many of the fears of wearing contact lenses have to do with hygiene; therefore, it is important to carefully follow directions for keeping your lenses, and anything that comes into contact with them, clean. Use mild non-cosmetic soap. Perfumed, oiled, and lotion soaps often cause irritation or even blurred vision because of the residue they leave behind on your hands.
Make sure your hands are dried with a lint-free towel before handling lenses.
Keep fingernails short and smooth to avoid scratching or damaging your eyes and/or the lens. If you do have long fingernails, be sure to use the pads of your fingers and not the nails., There is a correct order for putting on contacts, makeup, and hairspray. Avoid getting these products on your lenses by putting your contacts on first, then makeup and hairspray.Same order goes for removal: contacts first, all other beauty products second.
Avoid creams, lotions, and moisturizers before putting on contact lenses.
Be careful with waterproof makeup because a lens will bind to the makeup, forcing you to use an oil-based remover and basically destroying the lens.

, Depending on which contact lens you wear, they all require different solutions, drops, and cleaners. Otherwise, you risk damage to both lens and eye. Do not reuse solution because bacteria and debris remain in it after the first cleaning. Reusing solution has the potential to cause an eye infection.
Never use any kind of water to clean your contacts, always use solution.
Ask your optometrist for a recommended name brand and stay loyal to it. Although generic products are often cheaper, they may not be compatible with your contacts. Generic products are often old recipes sold by contact companies; if you are wearing the latest type of contacts from the company and wearing the previous generation's cleaning solution, you may run into issues.Stick to products made specifically for your contacts.

, This applies to using saliva as well. The reason is that lenses will absorb the water and swell, retaining the water with all of its nasty possibilities. This will also distort the lens for fitting and, in turn, scratch your eye making an entry way in for microorganisms. For the same reasons as above, do not wear your contacts while swimming. Swimming with contacts in puts you at risk for infection, in particular Acanthamoeba.Water is not solution and should never be used as a substitute.
If no solution is available and your contacts are irritating you, throw them away.

, It is important to routinely clean, dispose of, and replace your contact lenses. Even if you bought “no rub” solution it is always a good idea to gently rub your lenses between your fingers and then rinse them with solution to remove any unwanted debris from them.
Cleaning your case nightly. Again, use solution and not water letting the case air dry when you are finished.
Replace your case within every three months.

"
"
Keep track of expiration dates for lenses.,
Take your contacts out at night.,
Remove uncomfortable lenses.",How to Not Be Afraid of Contact Lenses3," Only wear your contacts for the recommended amount of time. Remember that prescriptions have expiration dates. If you wear your lenses beyond the expiration date, the surface of the lens breaks down making them vulnerable to the mucus and bacteria that are located in your eyelids. This can lead to infection.Ask your optometrist for a chart or scheduler to remind you of when the expiration dates are for your contact lenses. Or, make your own. There may also be an app or online tool available through the company that can remind you with emails or text messages.
Avoid sharing contact lenses with your friends. Wearing other people’s contacts will increase the possibility of getting an infection, especially if your friend already has any kind of eye condition or irritation.

, Avoid sleeping in your contacts no matter how tired you are. When your eyes are closed, tears are unable to carry an adequate amount of oxygen to your eyes. A lack of lubrication can cause small scratches on your cornea which can cause infection and irritation. If this begins to occur frequently, consider getting a prescription for overnight or extended wear lenses for safety.

, Take irritable contacts out immediately to reduce the chances of damaging your eyes. Also, after removing, do not put them back on your eyes until you visit your optometrist. Irritation or scratches on the eye can lead to infection. Eyes should always be clear and white. Remove immediately if you have red or itchy eyes, puffing or swelling, blurriness, or pain and discomfort.
If you do have these symptoms, try to combat it with lubricating drops specifically made for people who wear contact lenses.

Repeat the above steps to remove and clean your other contact.",How to Use Contact Lenses," Your optometrist may offer you various options depending on your particular eyes and needs. Understand what you want from your contacts.


Length of use: Some contacts are intended to be worn just for one day, then thrown out. Others are designed to be reused for an entire year. In between, there are contacts which are worn monthly and bi-weekly.
Softer contacts, which are worn for shorter periods of time, are generally more comfortable and healthier for your eyes, but more expensive. Harder contacts may be convenient in the sense that they need not be removed so often — but they are also more rigid, and they may be more difficult to adjust to than the softer varieties.
Daily wear contacts must be removed every night before you go to bed. Extended wear contacts can be worn when you sleep. Several extended wear lenses are FDA-approved for seven days of continuous use, and certain brands of silicone hydrogel AW lenses are approved for 30 days of continuous use.;
, Most eye doctors will give you a few options, and most will give you the chance to test out a particular brand or prescription before you commit to a large investment.


Try different brands. Some brands of contacts are thinner and more porous than others and have smoother edges, making for better comfort; however, they are typically more expensive. A good eye doctor will have you test-drive a brand for a week to make sure they are comfortable.
If you're unsure about what you want, ask your optometrist for a trial package that includes just one or two pairs of contacts. Your optometrist may also allow you to try out several contacts in their office, once it's clear that you're committed to choosing between one type or another.

, Some opticians refuse to prescribe contacts until patients reach a certain age — say, 13 — and some advise only part-time wear until you're of age.


The concern is whether or not the patient is old enough and responsible enough to care for their contact lenses properly, as improper care can have an impact on eye health. A parent or guardian can help determine if a patient is mature enough to properly care for lenses.If your optometrist or your legal guardians decide that you aren't yet old enough to wear contact lenses, get a pair of glasses. You can always start wearing contacts a few years down the line, but you may find that you like wearing glasses just fine.

, You can buy colored lenses with or without a prescription; however, it is not recommended to get colored or novelty contacts over-the-counter or without a prescription (this is actually illegal). Contacts are considered medical devices and a poor fit could cause serious damage to your eyes.You can choose a common eye color that's different from your own — say, blue, brown, hazel, green — or you can choose more outlandish colors: red, purple, white, tie-dye, spirals, and cat-eyes.
If you're getting a prescription for these, be sure to choose something that you're willing to wear every day. Contacts make for expensive novelty products.

, This basically means two things:


Always store your contacts in contact lens solution, unless you're wearing disposable lenses. Contact lens solution helps to clean, rinse, and disinfect your lenses.
Dispose of your contact lenses by the recommended date. Most lenses fall into one of three categories: dispose daily, dispose semi-weekly, or dispose monthly. Check your contact lenses for the recommended disposal date and don't wear them much longer than that.There are even online tools available to help you remember when to replace your lenses., Some solutions are made specifically for storing contacts, some solutions are made specifically for cleaning and disinfecting contacts, and some can be used for both. Ideally, you should use a combination of the two.


Storing solutions tend to be saline-based. They are gentle on the eyes, although they may not clean your contacts as effectively as chemical disinfectant solutions.
Cleaning and disinfecting solutions are either hydrogen peroxide-based (HPB) or multipurpose. HPB solutions require a number of steps, including using a neutralizer to keep the peroxide from harming your corneas when you put them back in. Multipurpose cleaners are easy to use and can often be used to sore contacts as well.
If your contact solution is irritating your eyes on a regular basis, switch to a hydrogen peroxide solution.
Always use the disinfecting solution, eye drops, and enzymatic cleaners that your eye-care professional has recommended. Different types of contacts require different types of solutions. Some eye-care products are not safe for contact lens wearers — particularly chemical-based, non-saline eye drops.

, Ideally, clean them every day, before and after use.Clean each contact by rubbing it gently with your index finger in the palm of your other hand. Most multipurpose solutions don’t have “No Rub” on their labels anymore. Lightly rubbing your contact removes surface buildup.
Change out the lens solution in your lens case every time that you store your contacts. Reusing solution greatly increases your risk of infection and is not advised.
Clean your contact lens case every time you use it with either sterile solution or hot tap water. Let it air dry. Replace the contact lens storage case at least every three months.

, Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and dry them thoroughly using a clean towel.


Remember – any residue from soaps, lotions, or chemicals may stick to your contact lenses and cause irritation, pain, or blurred vision, so soaps without scents or lotions are ideal.

,


If you put something into your eye that's already been in someone else's eye, you risk spreading infections and harmful particles from their eye to yours.All prescriptions are different. Your friend may be far-sighted while you are near-sighted; or, if you are both near-sighted, they may be significantly more near-sighted than you, to the point that her prescription actually blurs your vision even worse. Some people require specially-shaped contacts for conditions like astigmatism.

, You may need to change your prescription as your eyes age and grow.


Your eyes change over time. Your vision may deteriorate, and you may develop conditions like astigmatism, in which the eye becomes irregularly-shaped and develops refractive issues at all distances.Your optometrist may test your eyes for glaucoma — a deteriorative eye disease that can systematically dim your vision — and other potentially harmful eye conditions. It pays to keep up with your optometrist.

, Rinse thoroughly to get rid of soap residue. Dry your hands with a towel (since paper towels or toilet paper may leave pieces behind) or, if possible, an air dryer.Any residue from soaps, lotions, or chemicals may stick to your contact lenses and cause irritation, pain, or blurred vision.
Contacts stick best to wet surfaces. You may find that if you clean your hands, but leave your fingers slightly wet, the contact will stick to your finger more easily.

, Unless the prescription is the same for both, remember to check whether it’s for your right or left eye.


Leave the other side of the contact case shut, for now, so that dust and particulate matter don't contaminate the contact solution.
If you place the wrong contact in the wrong eye, you may not be able to see well, and you may experience pain. If your left- and right-eye prescriptions differ significantly, you'll be able to tell when you put the wrong contact in.

, (Handle with care, or you may damage or invert the lens.) Make sure that the contact is sitting hollow-side up on your fingertip with none of the side walls sticking to your skin.


Make sure to handle the lens on the skin of your finger, not the nail of your fingertip. It might be easier if you put a little bit of solution on your finger where you intend on holding the contact lens.
If it’s a soft contact lens, make sure that it isn’t inside-out. It sounds obvious, but sometimes it's difficult to tell. The contact should be a perfectly concave cup, sloping up evenly to the rim on all sides. If the slope isn't even, then the lens may be inside-out.
While it’s still on your finger, inspect lens for rips, tears, or debris. If dust or debris is visible, rinse with lens solution before putting it into your eye.

, Use the index finger of your opposite hand to pull your upper eyelid upward; use the middle finger of your dominant hand (i.e. the one with the contact on it) to pull your lower eyelid downward. As you become more experienced, you’ll be able to do this just by pulling down your lower eyelid.

, Try not to blink or move jerkily. It may help to look upwards. It's also advised to not focus the eye that you're putting the contact into; this will make it easier to place the lens.

, When first starting out it may be easier to place the lens on the white part of the eye than over the iris. The white of the eye is less sensitive and less prone to cause flinching.

, Let go of the skin around your eye and softly close your eye and look all around to center the lens. Take note of any pain or discomfort you may have. If you think that something may be wrong with your contact, remove and fully cleanse it, then try again.


You may need to keep your eye squeezed shut for several seconds to allow the contact to stabilize. If you can activate your tear ducts, however slightly, the natural lubrication will make the process smoother. Cup your hand underneath your eye in case the contact falls out.
If the contact falls out of your eye, don't worry — this is very common at first. Clean the lens with solution and keep trying until you get it right.

, When finished, pour any contact solution from the case into the sink. This is the best time to rinse the contact lens case and let it air dry with the lid off.Try keeping your contacts in for just a few hours at a time at first. Your eyes may dry out quickly until they're used to the lenses. If your eyes begin to hurt, take out the contacts and give your eyes a few hours to rest.

, Don't leave your contacts in for longer than your optometrist recommends. You should remove daily-use soft contacts every evening before you go to sleep. You can wear extended-use contacts for longer: several lenses are FDA-approved for seven days of continuous wear, and at least two brands of silicone hydrogel AW lenses are approved for 30 days of continuous wear.Remove contact lenses before swimming or using a hot tub. The chlorine puts you at a higher risk for a blinding infection called Acanthamoeba keratitis.If you're just starting to wear contacts, your eyes may not be used to the lenses; they'll dry out more quickly at first, and you may experience some pain. Remove your contacts directly after work or school for the first few days — as soon as you don't need perfect vision — in order to give your eyes time to rest.
Take out your contact lenses before you remove makeup or face paint in the evening to avoid getting any on the lenses., Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and dry your hands thoroughly with a clean, lint-free towel. Again, you may find that slightly wet hands help the contacts stick better to your fingers; this is especially useful when you're removing contacts from your eyes, particularly when the contact has dried tightly onto your eye.


Keeping your hands clean will dramatically reduce your risk of infection. If you don't clean your hands, then anything that you touched throughout the day — knowingly or unknowingly — will spread to your eyes.
It is especially important to avoid touching your contacts after you've made any contact with fecal matter — yours, your pet's, or anyone else's. Exposure to fecal matter can cause a pink eye infection and seriously compromise your optical health.

, Make sure you store your contacts in contact solution, not saline solution. Saline solution is not a sterile enough solution for storage.Be sure to keep particulate matter — dust, hairs, dirt, and other contaminants — from falling into the solution. Cleanliness is of the essence.

, Use the middle finger of your dominant hand to pull down the skin of your lower eyelid. At the same time, use the index or middle finger of your non-dominant hand to pull up the skin of your upper eyelid.


Look upward and carefully slide the contact down, away from your pupil, then pluck it out. Use a gentle touch and be careful not to rip the contact.
Eventually, with practice, you may be able to pluck the contact out without sliding it down. Don't try this before you're confident with your contacts, as a rough touch may rip or tear the lens.

, Place the contact in the palm of your hand. Drench it in contact solution and gently rub it with a finger, in a spiral, from the center to outer edge.


Flip the contact over and do the same to the other side.
Rinse the contact again with solution and place it in its proper (left or right) case. Make sure to always keep the contact for each eye in its own separate case. This is especially important, from a logistical standpoint if you have different prescriptions in each of your eyes. Keeping your contacts separate will also reduce the risk of spreading infections between your eyes.

, Again, be sure to place the contact in the correct side of the case. Leave your contacts in the case for at least a couple of hours and rest your eyes.


If you have trouble removing your contacts at first: practice, practice, practice! The process will only grow easier the more you do it.

Visit your eye doctor.,
Choose a lightweight contact lens.,
Get the right fit.",How to Wear Contacts With Dry Eyes1," Make an appointment with your eye doctor to get fitted for the correct contacts. Be sure to mention you have dry eyes. Talk to your optometrist about any concerns you have regarding contact wearing and any symptoms you have for dry eyes or any other contact lens-related problems.During your appointment, discuss your lifestyle briefly so you can choose what kind of contacts make the most sense for you – daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
Your eye specialist will also be able to help you uncover any other possible reasons for your dry eyes.;
, Be sure to get a watery contact lens, which means that the lens has high moisture levels. This will suit your eyes better than regular ones and help prevent the symptoms of dry eyes.The material that the contacts are made of matters greatly in this issue. The thicker the material, the more likely you’ll have problems with dry eyes (especially if you already suffer from dry eye symptoms). So choosing a thinner, more breathable material will help reduce your discomfort from dry eyes significantly.

, Work with your optometrist to ensure that your contacts are fitted properly to the shape of your eye. An ill-fitting contact will move around more than it should, often causing dryness and discomfort.If you think your contacts might not fit properly (they feel like they move around or don’t go in perfectly), consult with your optometrist about changing the prescription size.

Clean your contact case.,
Wash your hands.,
Find a mirror in a well lit room.,
Stand over an appropriate surface.,
Try the pinching method.,
Try the rolling method.,
Examine the lens for damage.,
Store your contacts.,
Learn about solutions to contact related challenges.,
Familiarize yourself with your contacts expiration date.",How to Take Out Contact Lenses with Nails," Before you begin the process of removing your lenses, make sure you have a contact container cleaned and prepared.


Make sure your container is free of debris by rinsing it out. Do not use tap water. Tap water is safe to drink, but not entirely sterile and can contain microorganisms that are harmful to the eye. Rinse out your contact lens container with solution, not water.Either wipe the case dry with a clean, lint-free towel or let it air dry. Air drying is preferable, as it reduces the chance of spreading bacteria or debris into the case.Contact lens cases should only be used for three months before being discarded. Keep track of how long you've had your case.;
, Before you remove your contacts, or do anything else that involves touching your eye, you should always thoroughly wash and dry your hands. Debris or bacteria you've had contact with throughout the day can lead to eye infection.


Get your hands wet with tap water. While people often encourage the use of warm water, temperature is a matter of personal preference. Warm or cold is fine.The soap you use to wash your hands before removing your contacts should be pH neutral and contain little oil or fragrance.Lather your hands, making sure to get between your fingers and the back of your hands. As you'll be touching your eyes directly, pay special attention to washing your finger tips and under your nails.Scrub your hands under running water for at least 20 seconds. In order to keep track of time, you can hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song to yourself twice.Rinse your hands. Be particularly careful about removing all soap, as soap can irritate your eyes.If possible, air dry your hands before handling contact lenses to avoid getting lint trapped in your eyes. If that's not an option, use paper towel as it's less likely to leave debris on your hands.
If you have one, it might be a good idea to use a nail brush. As you'll be having such close contact with your eyes, you want to make sure all debris is safely removed.

, In order to remove contact lenses, you need to be able to see your eyes. Find a clearly lit room that contain a mirror. Your lens should be position in front of the colored part of your eye. Look directly into your own eyes and see if you can use the mirror to see the outlining of your contact. You want to know where the lens is before touching your eye to avoid inadvertently touching the bare membrane., There's a chance you might drop your contact lens. To be safe, make sure you are standing over a clean surface. If you are standing over a sink, make sure you plug the drain so your contact lens doesn't disappear down the plumbing., There are two methods you can use to remove a contact lens if you have long nails. One is the pinching method, which involves using two fingers to remove the lens.


Most people find it easiest to use both index fingers, but this depends on personal preference. Experiment with different fingers to see which combination of fingertips makes you feel most in control.Use only your fingertips and not your nail. You do not want to damage your cornea or the contact lens.
Gently push both lenses inward, towards the center of your eye. The lens will pop outward.Secure the lens between both fingers. Do not pinch too hard, as you do not want to break the lens. The lens should not fold in half and opposite sides should not touch.Pull the lens forward until it comes out of your eye., Many find the pinching method to be difficult to coordinate. If you don't feel comfortable using it, you could try the rolling method instead.


Place your finger tip on the contact lens. Push the lens downward, towards the white of the eye.Push the lens until it reaches the lower lid and gently guide the lens into the lid.The lens should roll over. It will be pushed out, much the same way eyelashes are, and this allows you to grasp it and remove it from your eye., Long nails can be particularly harsh on contact lenses. After removing your contact, examine it for damages before placing it in the case.


With the lens resting on the tip of your index finger, hold it up to the light.
Examine the lens for any tears or debris. A damaged lens can cause eye irritation and potentially tear the cornea, causing damage to your eye. If you notice any damage, discard the lens rather than storing it., Once your contact lens is removed, it should be safely stored until you need to use it again.


Many people simply top off old solution when storing your lens. As solution is meant to disinfect, it can become contaminated with use. Dump out old solution and replace with it with a fresh dose.Close the lids of the contact case tightly and place the case in a safe place in your home until you need to use your lenses again.
Different contact lenses need to removed for different durations. Some can be worn overnight, while some cannot. Talk to your eye doctor about how often you need to remove and store lenses.

, While contacts are fairly easy once you're accustomed to caring for them, they are some difficulties associated with their removal. These can be easily remedied.


If you have trouble keeping your eyes open when removing contacts, use one hand to hold the upper lid and eyelashes while you work.If you have difficulty sliding lenses, stare in the mirror and keep your gaze steady. If you lose eye contact, your eyes have moved meaning the lenses positions have shifted.Be careful about rubbing your eyes with contacts in. This can damage the lenses and cause irritation to your eyes., Contacts do not last forever. Lenses come with a specific expiration date, related to the type of lens you wear. Ask your doctor how long lenses will last when being prescribed contacts. If you do not remember the information, check the box for instructions on when to discard lenses.

Contact lenses can correct:Myopia. People who are myopic can see well close up, but objects far away are blurry.
Hyperopia. In this condition, people see well at a distance, but objects close to them are blurry.
Presbyopia. This condition occurs when people have more trouble seeing close up as they age. It often begins around age 40.
Astigmatism. This occurs when the eye is not shaped correctly. It causes blurred vision.
Color blindness. Color blindness occurs when people are unable to perceive some colors, or confuse two colors with each other. Red/green color blindness, which means you confuse the colors red and green together, is most common in men.;
, Some can only be worn in the day, others can only be worn in the night. The eye doctor will measure your eye to make sure you get contacts that fit and are comfortable. Once you know what you need there are several types to choose from:Soft contact lenses. These contacts are flexible and bend to fit your eye. They can correct myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia, or combinations of these conditions. They are good for people who play sports and are active.
Hard contact lenses. These lenses may provide a better image than soft lenses and can be used for most eye conditions. They also have a lower risk of eye infections because they are gas permeable. This means that your eye can breathe through them. If you keep them clean, they can sometimes be used for up to three years; however, some people find them uncomfortable.
Hybrid contacts. These contacts have a hard center and soft outer part. They are particularly good for people with keratoconus, or an irregularly curved corneas.

, Hard contacts have the advantage that you can continue using the same pair for up to three years if your prescription stays the same; however, some people find soft contacts more comfortable. If you choose soft contact lenses, there are several types you can chose depending on your lifestyle and budget.Daily wear contacts: These are usually the cheapest option, but they require more care. You have to take them out each night and clean them.
Daily wear disposable contacts: These are worn for one day only, then thrown out.
Extended wear contacts: These contacts can be left in overnight for up to a week. This option is good for people who are too busy or can’t remember to take them out each night; however, they are not good for people who are prone to eye infections or allergies. Some brands may even be approved to wear continuously for 30 days.
Disposable contacts: These contacts require the least effort to wear. These are worn daily (so they must be removed at night) and are good for a certain period, from weeks to months, depending on the type you have. This makes them more expensive.

, While contacts that change your eye color or pupil shape may be fun, they can harm your eyes.If you want colored lenses, optometrist can give a valid Rx for cosmetic contact lenses that are safe to use on a limited basis under the direction of an eye doctor.


Contact lenses are medical devices that are quality controlled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In order for contacts to fit you properly and safely, your eye must first be measured by an eye doctor. Stores that sell costume contacts without prescriptions are doing so illegally.
Improperly fitting contacts can scratch the surface of your eye, cause infections, and even in severe cases, blindness.
Do not buy non-prescription contacts from street vendors, Halloween shops, beauty salons, convenience stores, or online vendors that do not require prescriptions.

, It may take some practice, but after a few days, you will be able to do it quickly and easily. Follow these steps: Wash and dry your hands. This will make sure you don't transfer dirt or bacteria into your eye, which can cause an infection.
Put the contact lens on the tip of your index finger with the concave, cup side facing up.
While looking in the mirror, use your middle finger to pull down your lower eyelid and lashes.
Place the contact onto the surface of your eye. The bottom edge of the contact should be the first part to touch your eye. It should do so on the white part of your eye just above where you have pulled your lower lid down.
Press the contact onto the surface of your eye until you feel it stick. When you take your finger away, the contact should float on the surface of your eye. Blink to adjust it to the correct position.
If you are inserting your contacts for the first time, your doctor may suggest that you wear them for only an hour the first day and then wear them for longer periods of time. This will give your eyes a chance to get used to them.

, Removing your contacts is important because it gives your eye a chance to breath. Some contacts should be removed every night. To remove your contacts:Wash and dry your hands.
Use your middle finger to pull your lower eyelid down.
Gently pinch the lens off the surface of your eye using your index finger and thumb. This should not hurt; however, while you are learning, it might be best to keep your fingernails trimmed. This will prevent you from hurting yourself or accidentally tearing the lens.
For some lenses, you can use a plunger (DMV), which makes it much easier to take out your contacts: just take the plunger, stick it onto the contacts, and remove them. Ask the provider of your contacts if they have one that you can have or buy.

, An injury or infection requires immediate care. Have someone drive you to an emergency room. Do not drive yourself. Get care immediately if you experience:Pain
Sudden vision problems like blurring or dark patches in your field of vision
Sensitivity to light
Bleeding or discharge from the eye
Swelling or extreme itching of the eye and eyelids. Throw out any contacts you were wearing during the infection to prevent re-infecting yourself later.

, Dry eye happens when your eyes don’t produce enough tears. It can be scratchy, itchy, sting, or burn. Your eyes may also look red.There are several over-the-counter products that may provide relief:Eye drops. You can get them with preservatives. This makes them last longer before they expire, but because of the added chemicals, you should not use them more than four times per day. Using them too often can make the irritation worse. An alternative is single-use eye drops which do not have preservatives.
Eye ointments. Ointments are thicker than eye drops and may interfere with your vision. Because of this, don’t use them at times when you need to drive or read. Many people use them before bed.
If eye drops and eye ointments don’t help your dry eyes, ask your eye doctor about special contacts that can help prevent dry eye. They are called scleral or bandage lenses and they are designed to hold moisture into your eye.

, Your eye doctor may want you to do several follow up exams to make sure that your contacts are the right fit for you.You might need a check up after the first week, month, or half year. Afterwards, your doctor will probably recommend an appointment once a year to make sure your prescription hasn’t changed.

, Don’t touch your contacts with unclean hands. If you do, you are transferring dirt and bacteria into your eyes. Before handling your contacts you should:Wash your hands with soap to remove oils, dirt and bacteria. If you transfer these to your contacts, it could cause an eye infection.
Rinse your hands thoroughly. If you get soap in your contacts it will sting when you put your contacts in.
Dry your hands with a clean towel. Tap water hasn’t been sterilized so you don’t want to transfer it to your contacts and then to your eye.

, This will be sterilized to prevent eye infections and chemically balanced to match the chemistry of your eye. This makes it both safer, better for your contacts, and less likely to sting. They are available at local drug stores and grocery stores. Ask your eye doctor if there is a particular one that she recommends for your type of lenses.Do not use a homemade saline solution. It isn’t sterilized, won’t have the right concentration of salt, and may have other traces of minerals or chemicals. This could cause eye infections or damage the lenses.
Do not use bottled or tap water. Even purified water is not sufficiently sterile. In addition, it will probably sting because it won’t have the correct salt concentration.
Do not use saliva. Saliva contains bacteria, enzymes, and many other contaminants which could increase your risk of an eye infection or damage the lenses.
Do not top up the contact lens solution when you soak or store your contacts. Change the solution instead to prevent the buildup of bacteria.
Do not use expired contact solution. If your contact solution has expired, throw it out and get new solution. It isn’t worth risking an eye infection.

, Put the contact in the palm of your hand and rinse it with contact solution while using your index finger to rub it. This will remove proteins, bacteria and dust that might have collected on it as you wore it.Keep your fingernails filed to prevent them from piercing and tearing the lens. If you do have long nails, you can use certain techniques to safely remove your contacts.
It is best to rub them, even if you have a “no-rub” solution.
Do this as often as your type of lenses require. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the lenses and contact solution, in addition to any recommendations from your doctor.

Make eye contact.,
Choose the eye that feels most comfortable.,
Lower your eyelid.,
Slightly raise your cheek muscle.,
Don't squint.,
Open your eye.,
Practice in a mirror.,
Practice on a friend.",How to Wink1," When you wink at someone, you only communicate something if they see you winking. So, before you do anything else, make eye contact with the person you plan to wink at.;
, Some people find it easier to wink with one eye than the other, while others can wink equally well with both.


Try each eye separately when no one is around in order determine which is easier for you.You may find that trying to wink with one eye will cause your face to ""scrunch"" more than the other. Or it may be that when winking with one of your eyes, you find it harder to control the other, making your wink look more like a blink.

, Lower the eyelid of the chosen eye while keeping the other eye open. When you are first starting out, you may have to concentrate pretty hard to make this work.

, Especially when you are first learning to wink, you may need to raise your cheek slightly to achieve full closure of the eye.


With practice over time, you should find you have to do this less and less.

, Try hard not to squint with the eye you are keeping open. The effort of keeping this eye open sometimes results in squinting for the beginning winker.When you first start out, this squinting will be hard to control. Again, with practice, you'll find you are doing this less and less.

, Once you've fully closed the winking eye, open it back up again. That's it!

, When you are first learning to wink, you'll probably find it helpful to practice alone in a mirror. Make eye contact with yourself and practice your winks.With enough practice, this will start to look and feel natural.

, When you think you've got it down, ask a friend to have a look at your winking. He or she can tell you whether it looks good or if you are still squinting or otherwise making it look like an effort."

Bring enough solution for your whole trip.,
Carry extra lenses.,
Take your eyeglasses with you.,
Keep a copy of your prescription with you.,
Consider bringing daily disposable lenses.",How to Travel With Contact Lenses1," Even within the same country, your brand of contact solution might not be available everywhere. To ensure that you do not run out, bring enough solution for the entire trip. It is better to pack too much than too little.Just remember that if you need to take more than 3 oz. you will need to pack it in a checked bag.


Pack your solution in ziplock bags in case the bottle leaks.
Don't transfer the solution into a different, smaller bottle to travel. While this may seem easier than buying a travel-sized solution, doing so can compromise the sterility of your solution.
Squeeze some of the air out of the bottle before you pack them. Air expands at high altitudes, which could cause the bottle to pop open while you're flying.;
, It is a good idea to bring an extra pair of contact lenses along. If you’re using disposable daily lenses, you might want to consider bring a few extra pairs. These will help prepare you in case of an emergency, like tearing or losing a lens.Keep your lenses secure within their case. You may even want to bring a larger decorative case so that you do not lose them in your bag or purse., While you might not use your eyeglasses on a daily basis, you should bring them along with you while you travel just in case. If anything happens to your lenses or if your eyes become irritated, you might have to switch to glasses., It is generally a good idea to keep a copy of your prescription with you. Even if you travel abroad, contact lens and eyeglass prescriptions are generally the same country to country. If anything happens to your lenses, you can replace them easily and without worry.If you are going to the UK or France, you will need a doctor’s prescription to get new lenses. Make sure that you speak to your doctor before your trip., If you are going somewhere where you might not have access to clean water, you might want to consider bringing daily disposable lenses instead. Bring one set for every day that you will be there, plus a few extra just in case. This will take away the hassle of cleaning your lenses while making sure that you do not put dirty water into your eyes."

Educate your patient.,
Document your findings.",How to Use an Ophthalmoscope," Turn the power switch to the on position to check if the light works. If not, replace the batteries and try again. Look through the aperture (eyepiece) to ensure clarity. Remove or slide open the aperture's cover if one exists.;
, There are several aperture and filter options that can be used for specific goals in an eye examination. The most common setting used is the Medium light source, because most exams are done in a darkened room when the patient has not been treated with mydriatic (dilating) eye drops.Ophthalmoscopes may differ in which settings are available, but some possibilities are:Small light – for when the pupil is very constricted, like in a bright room
Large light – for highly dilated pupils, like when treated with mydriatic drops
Half light – when part of the cornea is obscured, like with a cataract, to direct light into the clear part of the eye
Red free light – to better visualize the blood vessels and any problems with the vessels
Slit – to check for irregularities in contour
Blue light – to use after fluorescein staining to check for abrasions
Grid – to measure distances

, Generally, you should focus your ophthalmoscope to the “0” setting, which is the baseline. Be aware that focusing towards the positive numbers – sometimes marked on the instrument in green – focuses on things closer to you, and focusing towards the negative numbers – sometimes in red – focuses on things farther from you.For the PanOptic ophthalmoscope, focus using the focusing wheel on a point about 10-15 feet away from you. , Have your examinee sit down in a chair or on the examination table. Tell them to remove their glasses or contacts if they’re wearing any. Explain what an ophthalmoscope is and warn the patient about the brightness of the light emitted. If you will be dilating the pupil with mydriatic drops, explain the procedure and effects, including that they should have someone drive them home after.


You don’t have to go into much detail about the eye exam. Say something like, “I’m going to use this instrument to look into the back of your eye. It will be a bright light, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable.”

, Gloves are not necessary for this procedure, but it’s standard practice to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before and after any type of physical exam.

, Dilating the pupils provides easier and more thorough visualization of the eye structures, and is used often in optometrists’ offices. Have the patient tilt their head back. Gently pull out their lower lid, and drop the appropriate number of drops into the eye. Have your patient close their eye for about 2 minutes, and press on the corner of their eye where it meets the nose. Do this in both eyes.Tropicamide 0.5% is most commonly used, applying 1-2 drops about 15-20 minutes before your exam.Other agents used are Cyclopentolate 1%, Atropine 1% solution, Homatropine 2%, and Phenylephrine 2.5% or 10% solution.All of these drops are contraindicated in patients with a head injury that is being monitored. Review a list of your patient’s medications to ensure they have no interactions with the eye drops.Darker eyes may be less sensitive to drops and require more than lighter-hued eyes., Dim the lights considerably. Having extra lights on hinders the sharpness of the ophthalmoscope magnification.


Remember, if you are unable to make the room darker, adjust the light setting on your ophthalmoscope accordingly.

, You want to be eye-level with your patient, so stand straight, bend forward, or sit in a chair in order to be at the appropriate level. Position yourself at your patient’s side, and approach them from approximately a 45° angle.

, Let’s say we first want to evaluate the patient’s right eye. Wedge the ophthalmoscope against your right cheek with your right hand – when you move, your head, hand, and scope should move as one. Place the heel of your left hand firmly on the patient’s forehead and spread your fingers out, providing stability. Position your left thumb gently over their right eye and lift the right eyelid open.


Use your right hand and right eye to look at your patient’s right eye, and vice versa.
When using a PanOptic, steady the patient’s head as usual and approach them from 6 inches away at a 15-20° angle.Do not worry about getting too close to the patient during this exam. You must be as close as possible to perform a detailed examination.

, Instruct your patient to gaze straight ahead and past you. Providing your patient with a specific spot to steady their gaze will relax the patient and prevent hurried eye movement that will disrupt your examination.

, Hold the ophthalmoscope, still up to your eye, at about arm’s length from the patient. Shine the light into the patient’s right eye at about 15° from the center of the eye, and watch for the pupil to shrink. Then check to see if there is a red reflex.The red reflex is the reddish glint of light in the eye’s pupil caused by reflection of light off the retina, like what you see in a cat's eye in the dark. Absence of a red reflex can mean there is a problem with the eye.As you look through the scope for the red reflex, you may need to adjust focus a bit depending on your own eyesight.

, Moving your head, hand and scope as one unit, slowly follow the red reflex in closer to the patient’s right eye. Stop moving forward when your forehead comes into contact with your left thumb. Following the red reflex should direct you to being able to visualize the retina.You may need to focus your scope to bring features of the eye into focus. Use your forefinger to turn the lens dial, as needed.

, Use a “pivoting” motion to angle the ophthalmoscope left and right, and up and down.Observe the disc for color, shape, contour, margin clarity, cup-to-disc ratio, and condition of the blood vessels.If you have difficulty finding the optic disc, locate a blood vessel and follow it. Blood vessels will lead you to the optic disc.
Look for cupping or swelling (edema) of the optic disc.

, Pivot to examine the four quadrants of the eye: superotemporal (up and out), superonasal (up and in), inferotemporal (down and out), and inferonasal (down and in). Proceed slowly and carefully examine for signs of disease. This is by no means a complete listing, and you should use clinical judgment and knowledge during your exam, but watch for the following:AV nicking
Hemorrhages or exudates
Cotton wool spots
Roth spot
Retinal or venous occlusionEmboli, Instruct your patient to look directly into the light. This can be uncomfortable, which is why it’s saved for the end of the exam.The macula is responsible for central, focused vision, so visual acuity tests often indicate healthy or dysfunctional macula.The macula appears as a darker disc approximately in the center of the retina, with the fovea a bright point in the middle of the macula., Repeat the procedure on the other eye, and remember to switch which hand and eye you use for examination. Though some illnesses cause changes in both eyes, other problems may only show up in one eye; it’s important to observe both carefully.

, Explain any abnormalities that you noticed to your patient, what it might mean, and any further actions they should take. If mydriatic drops were used, instruct your patient they may experience light sensitivity and blurred vision for several hours. Remind them they should have someone drive them home. Provide them disposable sunglasses if they did not bring their own., Document everything that you saw in your examination, including specific notes on any abnormalities. It is often helpful to include pictures as visual cues to remember what you saw, and to compare to that patient’s later exams to see how things have changed.

Be especially careful around children.",How to Treat Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis)," Conjunctivitis can have a variety of different causes, which only a doctor can determine. However, you can identify the symptoms common to all the separate forms of pink eye. Symptoms of conjunctivitis include:Redness or swelling of the eye(s)
Blurred vision
Eye pain
Gritty feeling in the eye(s)
Increased tearing
Itching of the eye(s)
Sensitivity to light.;
, You may experience many symptoms of conjunctivitis if your eyes have been exposed to chemicals. If this is the case, flush your eyes with a sterile eyewash for around fifteen minutes or, if not available, just plain tap water, and then seek immediate medical attention.You can also seek advice from the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222.

, This is a relatively common cause for what appears to be conjunctivitis but is actually allergic keratitis. Patients can experience the above symptoms with an emphasis on bilateral eye itching (itching in both eyes). The symptoms are likely frequent but temporary based on exposure to the allergen.Non-eye symptoms associated with allergies include nasal discharge and sneezing.


These symptoms are usually more pronounced during spring or autumn when the pollen count is highest. Exposure to cat or dog dander can also cause or worsen symptoms.
If you suspect allergies are the actual cause, try treating them with an over-the-counter antihistamine such as Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin,

, If your pink eye is caused by a virus, then you may notice symptoms specific to the viral version of the condition. You will have only unilateral eye symptoms (in one eye). You may also experience tenderness in the preauricular lymph node—which is located just in front of the ear—on the same side as the affected eye.This is generally caused by h. Influenza. The conjunctivitis will likely present in addition to a range of other cold and flu symptoms, such as sore throat, congestion, and fatigue., The additional symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis ultimately depend upon the type of bacteria causing the infection. The most common are the skin bacteria staphylococcus and streptococcus. However, sexually transmitted bacteria, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, can also infect the eyes and cause conjunctivitis.


Staph and strep causes often stem from improper hand washing, frequent eye rubbing, and/or unsanitary contact lens usage. At the onset, you may notice unilateral eye tearing or crusting followed by a quick jump to bilateral eye symptoms. This is due to the highly contagious nature of the infection quickly spreading to the other eye.For conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia, you may notice the common symptoms, as well as an increased amount of watery tearing and significant eye crusting (to a degree where your eyelids may be stuck together when you wake up in the morning).In addition to the other chlamydial conjunctivitis symptoms, you may also experience green or yellow discharge from the eyes if gonorrhea is responsible for the infection., Tell your physician the exact symptoms you have experienced due to your conjunctivitis. This will help him or her confirm that the infection you have is indeed conjunctivitis and possibly even the cause.


Your doctor will examine your eyes to help make a diagnosis. This may include using a swab to test for bacterial conjunctivitis., As with many viruses, your body will beat the infection on its own. Most forms of viral conjunctivitis will clear within 7-14 days without any long-term consequences or complications to your eyes.If your doctor determines that a more-serious virus (such as herpes) has caused the symptoms, then he or she will likely recommend an antiviral medication.Do not attempt to use antibiotics for a viral infection as they are only effective against bacteria., For minor cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, your doctor may recommend allowing it to clear up on its own. However, for more-severe bacterial infections, your doctor will definitely prescribe antibiotics. In many cases, the prescription will be for antibiotic eyedrops or ointments to apply to the affected eye(s).Your physician can decide which eyedrops are right for you based on history, sensitivity or resistance to previous antibiotics, and/or allergies. Symptoms generally subside within 3-5 days, but keep your doctor informed of your status. Commonly prescribed antibiotics for conjunctivitis include:Ciprofloxacin 0.3% drops or ointment
Ofloxacin 0.3%
Levofloxacin 0.5% drops
Moxifloxacin 0.5% drops
Gatifloxacin 0.5% drops
Besifloxacin 0.6% drops
Tobramycin 0.3%
Gentamicin 0.3% drops
Erythromycin 0.5% ointment
Bacitracin/Polymixin B ointment
Neomycin/Polymixin B/Bacitracin
Neomycin/Polymixin B/gramicidin
Polymixin B/Trimethoprim

, The eyedrops your doctor prescribes to treat bacterial conjunctivitis may have side effects. Some of the most common include burning; red, itchy, crusty, or irritated eyes; eye pain; or a foreign object sensation in the eye(s). If you experience any side effects more akin to an allergic reaction to the drops, then contact your doctor immediately. These reaction may include:Rash
Hives
Itching (more broadly spread than just the associated itchy eyes)
Tingling
Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs

, If you wear contacts, switch to eyeglasses instead until your symptoms go away. The additional contact with the infected eye(s) can increase both your discomfort and your likelihood of spreading the infection., You can soothe some of the discomfort associated with an infection by applying cool compresses to your closed eyes.Seal some ice in a clean plastic baggie. Wrap with tinfoil to slow the melting of the ice, and then wrap the entire thing with a towel or paper towel to make it more comfortable against your eyelid. Place the compress against your eye for five minutes.


Use a different compress on each eye to avoid spreading the infection, and use a new compress each time.Warm compresses are not recommended. Though they may relieve some discomfort, the warmer environment can create an even better breeding ground for bacterial conjunctivitis.

, Artificial drops can help ease symptoms by reducing the gritty sensation in your eye(s). Speak to your eye care professional about using lubricating drops in conjunction with prescription eye drops.You can also put the artificial tears in the fridge to cool them. when dropped into the eye, this will soothe the eye even more

, Since bacterial conjunctivitis is highly infectious, ensure that you wash your hands often while you have the condition, especially before and after touching your eyes. Try to be mindful of touching your eyes and avoid doing it as much as possible.

, Eye makeup, sunglasses, towels, and any other object that comes into contact with your eyes can carry the bacteria.Avoid sharing these items with anyone, and wash items such as towels often.

, When wiping drainage from your eye, always use a clean tissue to avoid spreading the infection back into your eye.If you use a tissue to wipe your eye, be sure to properly dispose of it in the trashcan., Do not go to school or work until your symptoms have cleared up.Antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis can also reduce the risk of spreading the infection. Consult with your doctor when he or she writes the prescription how long you should wait before going back to school or work.

, Kids with pink eye are going to be much less vigilant about washing their hands and not touching their eyes. If you’re caring for a child with conjunctivitis, take these steps more seriously yourself to compensate to avoid spreading the infection to yourself."

Change to daily disposable contacts.,
Switch to a new brand of contacts.,
Use the right solution to soak your contact lenses.,
Use wetting moisture drops.,
Consider your diet.",How to Wear Contacts With Dry Eyes2," Optometrists believe that one of the leading causes of dry eye among contact wearers is lens soilage. This means that contact lenses accumulate dirt and residue each time you handle them, so the more times you do that the worse the problem will be.Transitioning to daily disposable contacts means that you only handle them once before using them, which minimizes the amount of irritants that come into contact with the eye.

, Just as changing shampoo brands can improve your hair’s luster and shine, switching to a new brand/type of contact lenses can eliminate (though perhaps only temporarily) the symptoms of dry eyes. This is often attributed to a change in the material the contact lenses are made of. A material change means your eyes must adjust to wearing the new kind of contacts after the switch.Make sure you confer with your optometrist before you make any decisions about switching bands. And be sure to get new contact lenses that are also meant for dry eyes.

, If you suffer from dry eyes, be sure to get a high moisture solution that you can use to store your contacts in each night. Make sure you use the brand recommended by your doctor, because using contact solutions that aren’t compatible with your lenses can degrade the lens quality over time.People can develop sensitivities over time, so even if you have just recently developed dry eye symptoms don’t discount changing your contact care regimen simply because it has worked in the past.

, If you choose to wear your contact lenses all day and are worried about your dry eyes, carry eye drops with you. In case your eyes feel dry, use artificial eye drops to keep them moist. This can reduce the discomfort you feel from dry eyes.These drops are available without a prescription.
If you find yourself using the drops more than every two hours, make sure you purchase the kind that is preservative-free.

, If you have trouble with dry eyes, you might think about adding an omega-3 or omega-6 supplement to your diet. These fatty acids have been proven to improve comfort and reduce eye dryness for contact wearers.Additionally, you could try fish oil, flaxseed oil, or krill oil, as all three have also been shown to have positive effects on reversing dry eye symptoms.
Drink plenty of water. This will help keep your eyes moist.

Understand orthokeratology.,
Decide if orthokeratology is right for you.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Consider laser eye surgery.",How to Wear Contacts With Dry Eyes3," Orthokeratology is a non-surgical procedure that uses specially designed contact lenses to reshape the eye and its curvature over time. This involves wearing specialized contacts at night while you sleep that work to change the shape of your eye. Then, in the daytime, you don’t have to wear any contact lenses.This is a temporary procedure – meaning if you discontinue your use of the overnight lenses, you will lose any vision benefits you might have gained while undergoing treatment.

, This type of treatment is great for people who have an active lifestyle, for those who are irritated by traditional contact lens use (like excessive dry eye), or for those may not want to deal with the hassle of regular daytime contact and glasses wearing.This is a particularly good option for people with low to moderate amounts of nearsightedness.
However, if you have significant problems with your eyesight – like corneal diseases, lazy eye, or irregularly shaped corneas – this may not be the best course of treatment for you.

, Make an appointment with your optometrist to discuss the benefits of orthokeratology and determine if this might be a good fit with your situation. Talk about your dry eye problems and all of the related factors so that you can make the best decision for you.

, For a more permanent solution to dry eyes from contacts, you might want to consider getting corrective laser eye surgery. This process uses laser technology to permanently improve your vision. After you are done healing from the surgery, you shouldn’t require glasses or contacts at all, which means your dry eyes won’t be bothered as much.Laser eye surgery can be quite costly (usually in the thousands of dollars) and often isn’t covered by insurance companies, as it is usually considered an elective procedure.

Say hello with a wink.,
Wink to indicate shared knowledge.,
Reassure someone with a wink.,
Flirt with a wink.,
Know when not to wink.",How to Wink2," Once you know how to wink, the next step is knowing when to do it. One common use of the wink is just to greet someone or say hello.For example, imagine you are at a party and are deep in a conversation with some friends. Another friend comes into the room, but you don't want to break up the flow of the conversation you are already in. A quick wink can be gesture of greeting that won't interrupt the conversation.

, Like Odin's missing eye, the wink can be a sign that you know something. It often has a conspiratorial meaning, suggesting that you and the person you are winking at understand something that others do not.Winks can be used, for example, as a way to indicate humor between you and another person. A wink can mean: ""I know you get this joke, even though other people may not."" It can also be a way to show someone you are joking when you say something ironically. For example, if you have a friend who knows a great deal about history, you might say: ""I have a really tough history paper to write this week. Too bad I don't know anyone who could help me out with that!"" and then wink.This kind of wink can also be used to mean that some plan you made should be put into motion. If you and some buddies are going to ambush a friend with water balloons, for example, a well placed wink could mean ""Go get those water balloons now!""

, A wink can also be used to reassure someone who seems to be experiencing difficulty in some situation. It works almost like a pat on the back.For example, imagine a friend of yours is giving a public speech, and you know he or she is really nervous. If you are sitting in the audience and your friend makes eye contact with you, a wink can send the message: ""You've got this pal.""

, A wink can also be a suggestive or flirtatious greeting to someone you are attracted to.This kind of wink sends the message: ""Hi there cutie!""
Some people find a slow wink works best for this purpose., There are some cases when winking can cause socially awkward situations or even get you in trouble. Be careful, in particular, about winking at the opposite sex.


Winking at someone of the opposite sex is often assumed to be an act of flirting. If this isn't your intention, think twice about winking. You may be misunderstood, especially if the person you are winking at doesn't know you well.
A misplaced wink can make people angry, especially if it might convey that you aren't taking them seriously or that you are being inappropriately sexual. Especially if you are in a position of authority, be careful about the situations you wink in."

Use the wink emoji.,
Wink with an emoticon.,
Use *wink*.",How to Wink3," In this modern world of cell phones and computers, using your eyes is not the only way to wink. You can communicate a wink via text message or a social networking site using a winking emoji.There are different types of winking emojis, depending on what type of phone you have, what social networking site you are using, etc.
An emoji wink is usually used to communicate that something is a joke, or to flirt.

, Before emojis were created, people would often use punctuation marks to create a winking face. Some people still prefer this style, called an ""emoticon,"" or use it because they have an older phone, or are using an email system that doesn't support emojis. You can communicate a wink in any of these ways:;)
 ;-)
(-!
~_^

, A less common way to indicate a wink in text or email that some people use is simply to place the word ""wink"" between two asterisks. This works in the same way as an emoticon or emoji to convey humor or flirtation.

Decide if you will wear contacts on the flight.,
Take out your lenses to sleep on the plane.,
Bring some contact solution as a carry-on.",How to Travel With Contact Lenses2," The air at high altitudes is much dryer than air on land, and this can cause your eyes to dry out and become irritated. If you are on a flight longer than two hours, you might decide to wear your glasses instead of your lenses until you land.If your flight is under two hours, you might decide not to take out your contact lenses. In this case, you might still want to bring a small bottle of lubricating eye drops in your carry-on to prevent your eyes from drying out.If you do take them out, make sure you keep the case in your carry on bag, as checked luggage can sometimes be lost or end up in the wrong location.

, If you are sleeping on your flight, remember to take out your lenses first. It might be a good idea to take out your lenses before you board the plane just in case. Wear eyeglasses until you have landed. This will prevent irritation.Some contact lenses are FDA approved for sleeping in. You may want to ask your doctor about that if you would like the option to sleep or nap with your contacts on., Bring a small, travel-sized bottle of contact solution in your carry-on with you. This must be 3 oz or less to pass through security. If you have a checked bag, pack a larger bottle in your checked bag and keep the smaller bottle in your carry-on.


Contact solution may count as a medical liquid, which means that you might be able to bring more than 3 ounces of it on board with you.Before you go through security, tell the security screeners that you have a medical liquid in your bag. Whether or not they allow it to pass is up to the individual agent. It may be better not to risk it and to bring only a 3 ounce bottle in your carry-on."

Determine if you need immediate medical attention.,
Determine how long to wash your eyes.,
Keep an eyewash solution at home.,
Use sterilized water.,
Make sure the solution is at the correct temperature.,
Choose a method to administer the eyewash.,
Don't hesitate washing out chemicals.",How to Wash Eyes With Water1," Some contaminants can cause chemical burns or other complications. Check the label of the chemical to ensure an eyewash is appropriate. You can always contact the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222 to learn how to respond to a particular chemical in your eyes.


You should also seek immediate medical attention if you develop symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, headaches or lightheadedness, double or impaired vision, dizziness or loss of consciousness, and rashes or fever.
If eye washing is ineffective in your situation, you should call the Poison Control Center and seek medical attention. You should also contact another person to come get you to ensure you receive the proper medical attention.;
, The amount of time you should spend washing your eyes depends upon the type of contaminant you need to rinse out. The times can vary greatly; however, you can never wash your eyes for too long when they have been exposed to a contaminant. Err on the side of caution when it comes to how long you rinse your eyes. You should wash:Five minutes for mildly irritating chemicals, such as hand soap or shampoo
Twenty minutes or longer for moderate-to-severe irritants, including hot peppers
Twenty minutes for non-penetrating corrosives, such as acids like battery acidAt least sixty minutes for penetrating corrosives, which include household alkalis like drain cleaner, bleach, and ammonia, Commercial eyewash solutions are sterile, and they have a balanced neutral pH of 7.0.This means that using an eyewash solution will always be preferable to simply using water.

, If you don’t have access to an actual eyewash solution, then try to use sterilized water. Tap water can still contain harmful elements that will further irritate your eyes


You can also use bottled water.
Milk can soothe burning from foods such as peppers. However, use sterile solution to flush your eyes as well. Always ensure that the milk hasn’t spoiled since this can introduce bacteria into the eyes.

, Especially when using bottled water or the milk combination, you should ensure that you don’t take liquids directly from the refrigerator. Regardless of which option you’re using to wash out your eyes, the temperature should be between 60–100°F (15.6–37.8°C)., You need some way to safely and cleanly introduce your water or eyewash solution to your eye. Some common household items you can use to do this include a bowl, a small cup, or an eyedropper. No matter the item you use, clean it thoroughly with soap and water and allow it to dry before adding your sterile water or solution to it.


A bowl is the best option whether you need to flush out a contaminant, a foreign particle, or even just for flushing tired eyes. The bowl should be large enough for you to fit your entire face in it.
You can use a small cup that fits snugly around the rim of your eye socket, such as a shot glass. However, this should only be used for contaminants or tired eyes and not for small particles in your eye.
You should avoid using the eyedropper for most situations that are simply treating dry, tired eyes.

, With all that being said, sometimes time is of the essence, especially with acid or basic chemical exposures. Getting a chemical rinsed out as soon as possible is more important than finding sterile solution, making sure it is at the correct temperature, etc. If you've been exposed to a corrosive material in particular, it's okay to just run to the sink and start rinsing.


The longer you leave these caustic/acidic materials on the surface of the eye, the more damage will be done. the goal is to rinse them out as quickly as you can.

, Always be sure you clearly understand the directions on the bottle, or the instructions provided by your doctor.Identify the eye you are instructed to place the drops in, and know how many drops you are to instill with each administration.(Usually it will be just one drop as the eye holds less volume than one typical drop.)
Check the clock to be sure it is time for the next use, or make note of the current time so you will know the next time you are to use the eye drops., Look at the liquid inside the container closely.Be sure you do not see anything floating in the solution (unless there are supposed to be particles in the drops).Be sure the product says “ophthalmic” somewhere on the label. It is easy to confuse ear drops, that say “otic” on the label, with those that are to be administered in the eye.Inspect the container to be sure it has not been damaged. Check the tip of the container, without touching it, to be sure there is no visible damage or discoloration., Do not use eye drops that have expired.Eye drops contain preservatives to help keep the solution free of unwanted bacteria. However once the expiration date is passed, there is a risk that the product has been contaminated.Some eye drops are to be used for no more than 30 days once the container has been opened. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist how long your product can be used once it has been opened.

, Use a clean cloth to gently wipe away any dirt or sweat from your eye area.If available, use sterile dressing material, such as sealed 2 x 2 pads, to wipe around your eye area.Use each pad or wipe only once, then discard.Water applied to the cloth or pad may help in removing any crusted or hardened material around your eyes.If you are treating an infected eye, wash your hands again after wiping away any crusted material before proceeding with instilling the eye drops., Avoid harsh shaking.Gently shaking the bottle, or rolling the bottle between your hands, ensures the eye drop solution is evenly mixed.Some eye drop medications consist of a suspension of particles, so shaking will evenly mix these particles in the solution.
Remove the cap from the bottle and place it in a clean place, like on a clean and dry towel., As you prepare to instill the eye drop, take precaution in every step to avoid touching any part of your eye, including your lashes, to the tip of the container.Touching the tip of the container to your eye can spread germs into the solution, causing it to be contaminated.By continuing to use a contaminated eye drop solution, you are at risk of re-infecting your eye with each drop used.If you accidentally touch the container tip to your eye, wipe the tip with an alcohol pad (70% isopropyl alcohol) to sterilize it or purchase a fresh bottle or let your doctor know you need your prescription refilled.

, With the container in your hand, position your thumb against your skin, just above your eyebrow area. This helps to steady your hand as you administer your eyedrops.Position the eye drop container about ¾ inch above your lower eyelid to help avoid accidentally touching it to your eye area., With your head tilted back, gently pull down your lower eyelid with your index finger.Pulling down your eyelid helps to create a space, or pocket, for the drop to settle into.Look up at a fixed point above you. Focus on a spot on the ceiling or something above you and keep both eyes open. This helps to avoid blinking., Gently squeeze the container until a drop falls into the pocket made by pulling out your lower eyelid.Close your eyes, but do not squeeze them shut. Keep your eyes shut for at least two to three minutes.Tilt your head down as if you were looking at the floor while keeping your eyes closed for the two to three minutes.Apply gentle pressure to the tear duct located on the inner part of your eye for 30 to 60 seconds. This helps the medication to remain in your eye areaand also prevents the drops from going into the back of your throat, which can cause a bad taste.
Use a clean tissue to gently blot any liquid that forms on the outside of your eye or cheek., If your prescription requires more than one drop for each dose, wait five minutes before you administer the second drop so it has time to absorb.If you put a second medication in immediately after the first, it will wash away the first medication before it has had time to absorb.


If you are to instill drops in both eyes, you can proceed with administering a drop to your other eye in about two to three minutes, once you have kept your eyes shut for the recommended amount of time., Place the top back on the container, without touching it or the tip.Do not wipe the tip, and do not allow the tip to come into contact with anything. It is important to keep the solution free from contaminants.Wash your hands to remove any medication or germs., If your doctor has prescribed more than one type of drop, wait at least 10 to 15 minutes before using the other eye medication.In some cases, ophthalmic ointments are prescribed along with drops. Use the drops first, then wait 10 to 15 minutes before applying the ophthalmic ointment., Most eye drops are to be stored at room temperature and some are to be kept in a cooler environment.Many prescription eye drops are to be kept in the refrigerator between uses. Be sure you know how to store your eye drops. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.Do not keep the eye drops in an area that is exposed to direct sunlight., Even though the manufacturer’s expiration date may still be valid, some drops need to be thrown away four weeks after opening.Record the date you first opened the eye drop container.Also check with the pharmacist or the product literature to determine if they should be thrown out and replaced four weeks after opening., If you experience symptoms such as eye pain or excessive watering, let your doctor know.Other conditions that warrant contacting your doctor include changes in your vision, red or swollen eyes, and if you notice unusual pus or drainage coming from any part of your eye., If you do not see any improvement or if your symptoms get worse, let your doctor know.If you are being treated for an infection, watch for symptoms in the other eye. Let your doctor know if you begin to see evidence that the infection may have spread., If you develop skin changes like a rash or hives, difficulty breathing, swelling around your eye area, swelling anywhere on your face, tightness of your chest, or feel like your throat is tightening, you may be having an allergic reaction.An allergic reaction is a medical emergency. Call 911 or seek medical attention the fastest way possible. Do not attempt to drive yourself to a hospital., If you think you are having an allergic reaction from your eye drops, rinse your eyes with an eyewash product if one is available.If you do not have an eyewash product, then use regular water to flush the eye drop solution out of your eyes to prevent further absorption.Tilt your head to the side, hold your eye open, and allow clean water to flush the eye drop solution from your eye., Be sure to clean your hands thoroughly, as you would if putting drops in your own eyes.Dry your hands completely using a clean towel., Before you prepare the child, be sure you have the correct product, you know which eye is involved, and how many drops to instill. Sometimes the medication is needed in both eyes.Check for visible particles floating in the solution, the expiration date, and be sure you have an ophthalmic product.Be sure the container has not been damaged and the tip appears clean and is not discolored. Do not wipe or touch the tip.Gently shake the container to be sure the solution is mixed., Explain what you are doing. Talk to the child and let them know what you are about to do.In young children, you may need to drop a small amount of the medication on the back of their hand so they can see it does not hurt.Let the child see you go through the motions of putting the drop into your own eye, or into the eye of another adult. Be sure the container has the top secured as you pretend to administer the drops to yourself or another adult., It often takes two people to put drops into the eye of a child. One person is responsible for gently holding the child in a comforting way and keeping the child’s hands away from their eyes.Take care not to scare the child. If the child is old enough to understand, let them know it is important that their hands are kept away from their eyes. Consider letting the child decide on how to best accomplish that, so the child does not feel trapped.
Suggest that they sit on their hands, or lie on their back with their hands beneath them. The assisting adult will need to help keep the child’s hands away from their eyes, and the child’s head as still as possible.Work as quickly as you safely can in order to minimize the stress and anxiety felt by the child., Be sure the eyes are clean and free of crusty material, dirt, or sweat.If needed, gently wipe the eyes using a clean cloth or sterile dressing materials if available. Wipe from the inner part of the eye to the outer part.Discard the cloth or wipe after each use. Do not continue to wipe the eye with a contaminated cloth or wipe., It may be helpful to hold or hang a toy above the child for them to focus on.With their gaze fixed upward, gently pull down the lower lid, and place one drop of the medication in the pocket created.Release the lower lid so the child can close the eye. Encourage the child to keep their eyes shut for several minutes. Place gently pressure on the tear duct to keep the solution in the eye as long as possible.In some cases, you may need to hold both the upper and lower lids open while administering the drop., Do not allow any part of the eye, including the lashes, to touch the tip of the container.Touching the tip to any part of the eye allows germs to enter the solution, and therefore contaminates the bottle., Put the top back on the container to avoid touching the tip to any material.Do not wipe or attempt to clean the tip. This can also cause the solution inside to be contaminated.Wash your hands thoroughly after instilling the drop in the child’s eye., Let the child know they did a fantastic job of helping their eye to get better.Even if it their behavior was less than cooperative, praise the child for helping. Hopefully the praise will make the next administration time easier.Providing some type of reward along with the verbal praise can be offered., For children that are severely distressed by the administration of eye drops, consider using another method.Recognizing that this method does not provide the same level of eye exposure to the medication, it still is better than no administration.Have the child lie flat, close their eyes, then place a drop of the medication on the inner corner of their eye, in the area of their tear duct.Have the child open their eye, and the medication will roll inside.Have them close their eyes for two to three minutes and apply gentle pressure on the tear duct area.Let the child’s doctor know if this is the only way to administer the medication. The doctor may alter the prescription or allow for more than one drop to be given as one dose, since less of the medication is entering the eye.Do not give more of the medication without talking with the doctor first. Using more than what is prescribed can cause irritation or sometimes mild burning from the preservatives contained in the solution., Young children or infants may need to be wrapped securely in a blanket to make giving them eyedrops easier.Wrapping them helps to keep their arms and hands secured so they are not able to touch their eyes as you apply the drops.You may need to hold both lids open in a young infant if they are not able to focus on an object once you touch their lower lid.

, After instilling the drops, offer something that helps to soothe the infant.Breast feeding, or offering a bottle, immediately after the eye drop can help to calm the infant."

If these symptoms persist and your condition does not improve, discontinue use of erythromycin and notify your physician as soon as possible. Erythromycin can also cause severe allergic reactions and you should discontinue use immediately if you notice the following symptoms:Rash
Hives
Swelling
Redness
Chest tightness
Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Dizziness or lightheadedness;
, Be aware of the contradictions of erythromycin, or the conditions and factors that may be specific to you and require withholding this treatment. Always inform your physician if you are pregnant or have allergies or are currently taking any medications. There are a number of conditions and situations in which you should not use erythromycin. These include:



Breastfeeding — Do not use erythromycin ointment while you are breastfeeding. Erythromycin ointment is a category B medication according to FDA regulations and is not expected to harm an unborn fetus. However, the medication may enter the bloodstream of a breastfeeding mother and be transported to the baby via breast milk.Allergy — Avoid using erythromycin if you have a known allergic reaction to it. Inform your physician about any allergic reactions you might expect after using erythromycin. He may either lower the dose or prescribe you with an alternative medicine. Hypersensitivity to erythromycin ointment can be similar to allergy, but to a lesser degree.Certain medications — Taking medications such as Warfarin or Coumadin may cause an interaction with erythromycin ointment. Inform your doctor if you are taking these medications. , Remove contact lenses and all eye makeup. Make sure that you have a mirror in front of you so you can see what you're doing or consider having a friend or family member help with application., Always ensure that your hands are clean before using the ointment by washing them with soapy water. Washing your hands before touching your face and eyes can help to prevent further infection.Ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly for at least twenty seconds with an emphasis on cleaning the areas in-between your fingers and under your fingernails.Use warm running water and soap.

, Tilt your head backwards slightly and then with the fingers of your dominant hand (or whichever you are comfortable with), pull down your lower eyelid. This will create a small pocket where you can insert the medication., Take the tube of ointment and place the tip of the tube as close as possible over the pocket you created in your lower eyelid. As you do this, you need to roll your eyes upwards, as far away from the tip of the tube as possible. This will lessen the chance that you injure the eye.


Do not touch the tip of the tube to the eye. This is important in order to prevent the contamination of the tube’s tip. If the tip is contaminated, this will cause bacteria from the infection to spread more easily and potentially infect other parts of your body or invite a new, secondary infection into your eye.In event of accidental contamination of the tube's tip, rinse the tip thoroughly with sterile water and antibacterial soap. Squeeze the tube to remove surface ointment that may have gotten in contact with the tip.

, Squeeze a ½-inch long ribbon of ointment (or the amount prescribed by your doctor) into the lower eyelid pocket.While doing this, continue to ensure that you avoid touching the tip of the tube to the surface of your eye.

, As soon as you have applied the right amount of ointment on your eye, look down and close your eyes


Roll your eyeball around in its socket with your eyes closed in order to evenly distribute the ointment.
Keep your eyes closed for about one to two minutes. This will give your eyes enough time to absorb the medication.

, Use a mirror to check that you have correctly placed the ointment into the eye. Remove any excess ointment with a clean tissue.


You may experience some blurriness due to the ointment. As a result, avoid driving or wearing contact lenses after applying the ointment as your vision may be temporarily compromised. You should basically avoid any activity that requires good visual acuity, such as driving or operating heavy machinery. Once your vision has returned to normal, you can resume such activities.
Your vision should return to normal after a few minutes.
Never rub your eyes even if you have blurred vision. Rubbing will only worsen the blurriness or injure your eye.

, Store the medication at room temperature, not exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius)., Know how often you need to apply the ointment and stick to those instructions. Most people have to use the ointment four to six times daily.Set alarms or reminders throughout the day to ensure all doses are met.
If you miss a dose, apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if your next scheduled dosage is coming up, then skip the missed dosage and get back on the schedule. Never apply extra ointment as a way to compensate for a missed dose., The duration of erythromycin use can range from a few weeks to six months.Always complete the full course of erythromycin treatment as directed by your doctor. Antibiotics always require their full course of treatment. Though your eye infection may already have healed, you eye may become re-infected if you do not continue to use the medication for the length of time prescribed.A relapse of eye infection can potentially be worse than the initial infection.
In addition, not completing the full course of antibiotic treatment runs the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is an increasing problem for illness requiring antibiotic treatment.

, After the prescribed length of time of using erythromycin, you can visit your doctor for a follow-up appointment. If you experience any problems or side effects, such as severe itchy watery eyes, you may have an allergy and need to rinse your eyes immediately with sterile water. Have someone take you to an emergency care facility immediately or call 911.


If infection still persists after duration of erythromycin as determined by your doctor, inform your doctor. Your doctor may advise using the ointment for a longer period or time or opt for another treatment."

Get a bowl.,
Fill the bowl with the eyewash solution.,
Submerge your face in the bowl.,
Open and rotate your eyes.,
Lift your face from the bowl and blink.,
Repeat as needed.,
Use a clean towel to dry your face.",How to Wash Eyes With Water2," Administering the eyewash from a bowl is the primary method for flushing eyes that have been exposed to a contaminant or that have a small foreign particle in them. It’s also ideal for everyday relief of tired eyes. The thoroughly cleaned bowl should be large enough for you to fit your face in it.

, Whether you’re using an actual eyewash solution or simply water, make sure that the liquid is between 60–100°F (15.6–37.8°C).Do not fill the bowl to the brim because placing your face in the bowl will cause it to overflow.

, Take a deep breath and dip your entire face into the bowl so that the solution covers your eyes as well. Make sure not to tilt your head too far forward into the bowl or the solution will run up your nose.

, Ensure the whole surface of the eye comes into contact with the water. Rotating your eyes in a circular pattern helps get the water in your eye, which will help remove the contaminant or particle., Remove your face from the solution. By blinking a few times, you will further ensure that the solution gets an even coating over your eyes.

, For dry, tired eyes, you can simply dunk your face once or twice until you feel relief in your eyes. In order to actually flush out a contaminant, refer to the guidelines in Method 1 for the amount of time you should spend flushing your eyes.


Again, you can't over-wash your eyes. If you've been exposed to an irritant, especially a chemical, it's okay to wash longer than the suggested amount of time.

, Don’t wipe at your eyes at all. Simply pat dry your closed eyelids with a clean, dry portion of the towel.

Position the cup snugly against your eye.,
Tilt your head back.,
Look around and blink.,
Repeat as necessary.,
Use a clean towel to dry your face.",How to Wash Eyes With Water3," This method is best for washing tired eyes. If your eye has been contaminated, then the ideal method is the previous bowl method. Consult an eye care professional before using this method for anything other than washing tired eyes., You want to choose a cup that is roughly the diameter of your eye socket. A thoroughly cleaned shot glass is one example of a small-diameter cup for this method.


The commercial eyewash solution or sterile water should be between 60–100°F (15.6–37.8°C)., Tilt your head down toward the cup. Place the rim of the cup snugly against your eye socket.

, While still holding the cup against your eye socket, tilt your head back so that your eye and the bottom of the cup both face upward. This will bring the solution in direct contact with your eye.


Be prepared for some small spills. Lean over a sink while you do this so that the solution doesn't run down your face and onto your clothes. If you're worried, wear a towel around your neck to keep yourself dry.

, By looking around in a circular pattern and blinking several times, you’ll help the solution cover much of your eye, which will help hydrate them or remove the contaminant., You can then lower your head to remove the cup without spilling the solution all over yourself. One round of flushing might be enough for dry, tired eyes. However, you may need to repeat in order to finish flushing a contaminant from your eyes.

, Don’t wipe at your eyes at all. Simply pat dry your closed eyelids with a clean, dry portion of the towel.

Blink several times.,
Repeat as necessary.,
Try a towel.",How to Wash Eyes With Water4," This method is best for washing tired eyes or for washing the eyes of small children who do not understand the other methods. If your eye has been contaminated, then the ideal method is the bowl method.

, Submerge the tip of a clean eyedropper in your solution or water, then depress and release the dropper's bulb to draw water into the dropper.


If you have a sterile plastic syringe, you can also carefully use one that does not have a sharp tip or needle.

, Tilt your head back, raise the dropper just above your open eye, and squeeze the bulb delicately to release a few drops of water.


Ensure that you do not actually touch the dropper to your eyes or eyelashes.

, To get an even coating of the solution across your eye, blink several times. Try to blink the solution into your eye before it pools and run down your cheek instead.

, You may only need a few drops in order to refresh dry, tired eyes. However, you will likely need to repeat the process numerous times in order to actually flush a contaminant out of your eye.

, An alternative method for young children is to dip a clean cloth into the solution before gently dabbing in on the child’s closed eyelid. Even with light pressure, the dabbing will squeeze the solution onto the eyelid and lashes, which the child will then spread over the eyes by blinking.


Repeat as needed, but do not double dip the same spot on the towel into the solution for sanitary purposes. Use a different dry section of the towel, or use a different towel entirely.

Allow the solution to cool.",How to Wash Eyes With Water5," Note that professional-grade, commercially available eye washes are always preferable to homemade remedies. No matter how meticulous you are, there's always the risk of accidentally irritating the eyes or giving yourself a potentially severe infection.There are reported cases of people trying to make saline solution at home and getting acanthamoeba infections. This is a risky procedure. However, if you understand the risks and still want to make your own eye wash solution, there are measures you can take to ensure that your solution is as clean and safe as possible. Begin by boiling a pot of water to kill bacteria and other organisms in it that can contaminate your eyes. Bring the water to a full rolling boil for at least one minute and then cool before use.If possible, it's better to use sterile, purified water rather than ordinary tap water. Tap water can contain more bacteria and additives than sterile water.
If you don't want to make an eye wash solution, you can always substitute tap water. Just understand that it may be more irritating and it carries a higher risk of containing bacteria, etc., For homemade eye washes, add one teaspoon of ordinary table salt for each cup of water while the water is boiling. The closer your solution is to the natural salinity (salt concentration) of your tears, the lesser the shock to your eyes. Though the salinity of tears varies based on whether the tears are produced as the result of emotions (pain, sadness, etc.) or merely as a lubricant for the eye during normal use, tears are usually less than 1% salt by weight.

, Ensure the salt that you add dissolves in the water. Since the water is boiling and you've added a relatively small amount of salt, it shouldn't take much stirring to dissolve it completely. Stir until you no longer see solid salt grains at the bottom of the pot.

, Never use an eyewash that's still hot. You can seriously injure or even blind yourself by burning your eyes with hot water. Remove your solution from heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. You may transfer the solution to a different container, provided the container has been carefully washed and rinsed with soap and sterile water. When the solution reaches room temperature (or lower) it's ready for use.


Cover the solution while it's cooling to ensure no new contaminants are introduced.
Keeping the solution cool can give it a refreshing effect when it's used on your eyes. However, don’t cool the eyewash below 60°F (15.6°C).It can be painful and even slightly damaging to your eyes.
Even if you take extra care to keep your solution clean, be sure to throw it out after a day or two. Bacteria can be re-introduced to a solution after it's been boiled.

Don’t drink alcohol.",How to Eat the Right Foods to Settle an Upset Stomach," Wait a while after you stop vomiting or have diarrhea before you try to eat any solid foods. Children should wait at least 6 hours after they stop vomiting before starting solid foods.You can usually begin to add bland foods back to your diet the day after you have diarrhea.


If nausea is a problem in keeping food down, take sure you can keep liquids down for a while before you try eating any solid food. First try ""clear liquids,"" like chicken broth alone, then advance to ""full liquids,"" such as chicken noodle soup or smoothies. Next, try soft foods like mashed potatoes, and then finally a full general diet.
When you feel well enough to try solid food and nausea is no longer an issue, only eat easily digestible foods a little bit at a time throughout the day.;
, The BRAT diet includes bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce and toast.These foods can absorb fluid, add stool bulk and tend not to stress your already sensitive stomach.


Bananas can also help to replace some of the potassium that your body has lost from vomiting and/or diarrhea., It is thought but not proven that papaya aids digestion and can help with constipation. It has enzymes that break down proteins, making them easier to digest. The tropical fruit also promotes a healthy environment in your stomach. You can try papaya extract pills if you can’t find the fruit readily available.

, Ginger helps with nausea, gas, increases bile and gastric juices, relaxes digestive muscles and can aid discomfort. You can drink a cup of ginger tea, chew on fresh ginger, or eat a piece of candied ginger.Fresh ginger can be very intense so be careful when you first put some in your mouth.


The recommended limit for ginger intake is no more than 4 grams of ginger a day. You should start with 1 gram a day in divided doses every 4 hours, if needed., Fennel is an anise-flavored herb that is often used for stomach complaints. It can help with heartburn, bloating and colic as well as other stomach issues. Fennel relaxes digestive muscles and alleviates stomach discomfort. , For some people, a serving of plain yogurt with active cultures can be beneficial for an upset stomach. The active cultures in yogurt are a type of bacteria that live in your gut and help with digestion. Eating yogurt can increase the number of these good bacteria in your digestive tract., This herb is popular for use after a large meal, usually in the form of mint candies. It's believed but not proven that peppermint, in particular, can help to settle your stomach and relax digestive muscles. It also tastes great and freshens breath.

, Once you have been able to eat the BRAT diet, try some other foods such as skinless chicken, soft fruits and vegetables and sherbet. Introduce new foods in small amounts over time. If you get sick again, go back to a liquid diet and wait until you feel better before introducing solids again.


Use smaller portion sizes when you first start incorporating food into your diet again, especially if you haven't eaten solid food in a few days. Sometimes it's not the food itself but an amount that the stomach isn't used to that can cause indigestion.
You can usually resume your normal diet by 48 hours after vomiting or diarrhea.

, It’s important to stay hydrated, especially if you are vomiting or have diarrhea. Water can also help flush out whatever is bothering your stomach. Be sure to drink your water slowly so it doesn’t also contribute to the problem.


If you have such bad nausea or vomiting that you are not only not able to eat food, but you also cannot keep down liquids, you need to go to the emergency room to be admitted to a hospital for IV fluids. You should receive IV fluids until you can tolerate liquids again.

, Drinking warm herbal tea can be very soothing to a sensitive digestive system. Peppermint, chamomile and ginger tea can all be effective for stomach upset.Try sipping a few cups of tea throughout the day to help with nausea, indigestion and stomach pain.

, They are easy to digest and will help keep you hydrated.

, Sometimes swallowing can be difficult when you are very nauseated or vomiting. You still need to get liquids in you, though, as often as possible. Ice chips can be a good source of fluids because they melt slowly and can provide some cooling relief.

, If your upset stomach is caused by acid reflux, buy some Tums at a drug store and take the recommended amount. If this is a chronic problem, see a doctor. You may need a prescription medicine, such as an HH2 Blocker, such a famotidine, or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), like omeprazole., Additionally, soda often contains citric acid and sodium benzoate. These chemicals can bother a sensitive stomach, so it’s best not to drink soda when you don’t feel well.

, Chocolate may also contain milk or nuts which are not easy to digest for many people. It’s a good idea to stay away from chocolate and items with caffeine, such as coffee or energy drinks, when your stomach is upset.

, Fatty foods include meats, soft cheeses and fried, oily foods like french fries. These foods will probably make you feel even worse, so don’t eat them when your stomach is upset.

, Foods that contain a lot of acid like citrus and tomatoes can make acid reflex feel more intense, which may intensify your pain.They can also be irritating to a stomach that is upset. Avoid things like spaghetti sauce, orange juice and other tomato products while your stomach hurts.

, However, if you are used to eating spicy foods, then eating them with an upset stomach might not cause as many problems for you than for someone who is not used to them. Just be careful when you start to eat spicy foods again that your stomach does not react negatively.

, Alcohol can contribute to acids in your stomach. Additionally, alcohol is difficult to digest and metabolize and may really irritate your stomach. It is best for you and your stomach that you do not drink alcohol when your stomach hurts or you are already nauseated."

Lose weight with a friend.",How to Get Rid of Your Belly," If you want to lose weight, you'll have to restrict your calorie intake - simple as that. Luckily, the belly is one of the first places to trim down once you start losing weight, so it is easier to shift than stubborn bum, thigh or arm fat.


One pound of fat equals 3,500 calories. In other words, in order to lose one pound of fat per week, you will need to cut 3,500 calories from your weekly diet.
You can lose 1 lb. per week by cutting 500 calories per day. For instance, reduce your calorie intake by 250 per day and burn 250 calories each day through exercise.
Don't lie to yourself about your calorie intake. Keep track of every bite that passes your lips in a food diary or online calorie tracker.
Eating a healthy diet and reducing your calories accounts for 80% of weight loss, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you can eat whatever you like as long as you exercise.
A healthy goal is to lose between 1 and 2 pounds per week - any more than that is considered crash dieting and the weight loss will be nearly impossible to maintain.
Depending on how overweight you are to begin with, women should eat between 1,500 and 2,000 calories per day in order to safely lose weight, while men should eat between 2,000 and 2,500.;
, Eating more soluble fiber is essential for healthy weight loss. It helps to cut down on visceral fat, which is the potentially dangerous fat stored around vital organs such as the heart, lungs and liver. People who store fat in their bellies are more likely to have a higher percentage of visceral fat than those who don't.


Breakfast is one of the easiest meals to incorporate more fiber into. Switch to eating high fiber cereals or oatmeal. Eat whole grain breads and bake muffins with wheat bran.
Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables (such as apples, carrots and potatoes) as much as possible, as the skin contains the most fiber (in addition to the most vitamins and nutrients).
Introduce more split peas, beans (black, kidney, pinto), and nuts (almonds, peanuts) into your diet, as these foods are all high in fiber.

, Sugar is the enemy when it comes to fighting belly fat, as it's full of empty calories which provide no nutritional benefit whatsoever.


When too much sugar is consumed, the body cannot burn it, so it's gets converted into fat and stored in places such as the belly, butt, thighs, and breasts.
Naturally-occurring sugars, such as those found in fruit, are okay (in moderation), so it's really the added sugars you need to watch out for. These sugars are found in most packaged and processed foods, such as ready-to-eat cereals, candy, breads, and sodas.
Watch out for many low- or non-fat products, which are actually very high in sugar. This is the case for many yogurts, cheeses, and sauces.
Make sure to read the labels on any products you buy and look out for ingredients such as maltose, dextrose, ribose, xylose, lactose and sucrose - as these are all just misleading names for sugar.
Stay away from anything that contains high fructose corn syrup - this is an artificial sweetener which is just as fattening (if not more fattening) than actual sugar.

, Remember that losing weight doesn't mean you need to starve yourself - you can eat as much fruit and veg as you like. In fact, at mealtimes the majority of your plate should be filled with vegetables.


Any protein you eat should be about the size of a deck of cards, while servings of carbohydrates should fit inside your palm. The rest of your plate should be filled with vegetables.
Visually, filling your plate with vegetables will help to trick your brain into believing you're eating a large amount of food, which can help you to feel less deprived and prevent you from filling your plate with more rice, potatoes or meat instead.

, Surprisingly, eating more fat can actually help you to lose weight - but only if you eat the right kind and the right portions. All fat has 9 calories per gram so when you're trying to cut calories/lose weight, fat adds up quickly.


Foods containing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are healthier than saturated fats. To consume more MUFAs, try to use more olive oil when you cook, eat more avocados, and choose small portions of nuts like walnuts and pine nuts as a snack.
You should also eat more oily fish, which is an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids. Try cooking salmon, mackerel, trout, herring, and tuna.
Stay away from trans-fats, such as those found in margarine and most processed foods, as these are bad fats which will prevent weight loss.

, Drinking water is very important when attempting to lose belly fat. Water flushes out the system, eliminating toxins and leaving you less bloated as a result.


Water helps to regulate your metabolic rate, helping you to burn fat more efficiently. Drinking water helps to suppress your appetite, making you less likely to overeat at mealtimes. If you're ever tempted to eat something unhealthy, try drinking a glass of water instead!
It's normally recommended that you drink eight 8-oz. glasses of water per day, though you may need more if you're doing lots of exercise, sweating a lot, or if it’s very hot outside. Instead of drinking coffee, try to kickstart your day with a cup of warm water and lemon.
You can also increase your hydration levels by drinking more green tea, which contains antioxidants known as catechins.

, Rather than doing a ton of crunches and push-ups, cardiovascular exercise is the best thing you can do to burn calories and eliminate belly fat.


However, rather than slogging at a steady pace on the treadmill, you should try to do interval training. Interval training involves integrating short bursts of high-intensity exercise into your daily workout.
Try sprinting for 30 second intervals throughout your run, or set the elliptical, treadmill or exercise to interval mode in the gym.
To trim belly fat, aim to do 30 minutes of high intensity cardio exercise at least four times per week.

, Aside from the time you spend working out in the gym, it's a good idea to incorporate more activity into your everyday life - this way you can burn more calories without too much effort.


Make some simple changes, such as taking the stairs or biking to work a couple of days a week. If you work a desk job, consider switching to a standing desk. Simply by standing instead of sitting for a couple of hours a day you will burn more calories.
Take this as an opportunity to do some spring cleaning, to paint the house or fix up the garden - having a project to work on will help you to increase your activity levels without even realizing it!
Also try to do active things purely for enjoyment - play soccer with your kids after school, take up a dance class, or spend a fun day at the beach.

, It's an excellent idea to incorporate some strength training into your weekly workouts. Strength training includes things like squats, deadlifts, bicep curls and leg presses.


Although these exercises don't burn as many calories as cardio, they will benefit you in the long run. They will help you to build strength and muscle, which speeds up your metabolism and helps you to burn fat more easily, even at rest.
Exercises like squats and deadlifts will also help you to build muscle around your core and keep your waistline trim. However, it's very important to have the correct form while performing these exercises, so if you've never done them before consider attending a class or enlisting the help of a personal trainer.
Core work with weighted objects is an effective way to burn fat, and medicine balls or kettlebells work well for these kinds of exercises.

, Many people falsely believe that doing hundreds of crunches will help to eliminate belly fat and give you tight, toned abs.


However, it is impossible to ""spot reduce"" fat in this way, so any muscle you build will be hidden under the existing fat and possibly bulk you up even further.
Therefore, it is a good idea to put the crunches and sit-ups on hold until you have lost your existing belly fat. Then, once you have lost the weight, you can work on toning your midsection.
Instead of crunches and sit-ups, consider doing exercises that engage multiple muscle groups (not just your core) and which simultaneously work the cardiovascular system. Plank exercises are excellent for this., Although it may be surprising, getting enough sleep is actually hugely important when it comes to getting rid of belly fat.


When you're tired, your body produces more ghrelin, which is a hunger-inducing hormone that stimulates cravings for sugar and fatty foods.In addition, lack of sleep messes with the production of other hormones, potentially leading to increased cortisol levels and insulin-sensitivity - both of which have been linked to belly fat.Therefore, you should try to get at least 7 or 8 hours of good quality sleep a night. If you're having difficulty, try to cut down on caffeine and avoid watching TV or working on your laptop before bed - read a book or have a relaxing bath instead., Studies have shown that increased levels of cortisol (a hormone caused by stress) are linked with high levels of belly fat.In addition, it is much easier to make poor food choices when you are stressed out, especially if you are extremely busy or tend to comfort eat.
Therefore, it is important to reduce your stress levels in order to combat belly fat. Exercise can benefit hugely when it comes to stress reduction (and fat reduction), as can adequate sleep.
You should also take some time for yourself to do things you enjoy. Read a book, go see a movie, or just spend more time with friends and family. Activities like meditation and yoga have also been found hugely beneficial in reducing stress.

, Heavy or regular drinking is not conducive to a flat tummy. This is true for several reasons:


Alcoholic drinks ( beer and cocktails in particular) are high in calories. Therefore, simply by grabbing a couple of drinks after work you could be significantly increasing your total calorie intake.
Drinking alcohol puts excess pressure on your liver, which has to work overtime just to clear the toxins from your system. This takes energy away from other important bodily processes such as burning fat and building muscle.
You don't need to give up alcohol altogether, but try to limit your drinking to a Friday or Saturday night, and never binge drink. It’s recommended that women consume 1 drink or less per day, and men consume 2 drinks or less per day.One drink is equal to 5 oz beer, 12 oz wine, or 1.5 oz liquor.

, If you're finding it hard to stay motivated, try to remind yourself of why losing belly fat is important for your health.


People with high levels of belly fat are more likely to have increased levels of visceral fat, which is the fat that forms around important internal organs, like the heart, liver and lungs.Although visceral fat is not all bad (as it protects the organs), too much of it can produce harmful, toxic substances within the body and lead to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and certain cancers.Therefore, you shouldn't just lose belly fat in order to look better - you should do it because it is important for your overall health. In order to achieve minimal visceral fat, you should aim to have a waist measurement of less than 35 inches (88.9 cm) if you're a woman and less that 40 inches (101.6 cm) if you're a man., If you're in the habit of constantly weighing yourself, it can be disheartening when you don't see any progress.


However, weight can fluctuate quite a bit from day to day and even from hour to hour, depending on what you ate and when you had your last bowel movement. Therefore, it's important to standardize your weigh-in procedures in order to get a more accurate indication of your progress.
Weigh yourself at the same time everyday - most people prefer to do it in the morning, before breakfast, as this is when your weight should be at it's lowest point. Some professionals recommend weighing yourself each day to stay aware of your weight., In addition to weighing yourself, it's a good idea to take measurements in order to track your progress. Sometimes, even if you haven't lost any pounds, you may have lost inches.


Calculate your waist-to-hip ratio by measuring your waist (the thinnest part around your navel) and your hips (the widest part around your hip bone).
Divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement in order to get your waist-to-hip ratio.
A healthy waist-to-hip ratio for women is 0.8 or lower, while for men is is 0.9 or lower., Another good way of tracking your progress is to take pictures of yourself. This can help you to get a more visual indication of your progress, thus helping you to stay motivated.


Take pictures of yourself at the beginning of your weight loss journey, and at several milestones throughout. Take a picture from the front, from the back and from the side - having someone else take the pictures might be helpful.
Take the pictures in your underwear, or in tight-fitting clothes, so you can really see your body shape. Stand up straight and gesture your posture, but don't try to suck your belly in as this is giving a false impression. Let it all hang out.
Compare each photo you take with the original - you will be amazed with your progress.

, Staying motivated to lose weight can be very difficult, especially when everyone around you seems to eat whatever they like and sits in front of the TV instead of going to the gym in the evenings.


If you can, enlist a friend or family member to go on your weight loss journey with you. A slight competitive spirit might be just what you need to get yourself in gear.
Organize to go to the gym, or even go on walks together. Do your weekly weigh-ins together too - that way you will have someone to hold you accountable if you haven't hit your weight-loss goal!

Eat mostly plant-based foods.,
Replace butter with heart-healthy oils.,
Limit red meat.,
Include low-fat dairy products.,
Eat seafood at least two times a week.,
Cook with herbs and spices instead of salt.,
Indulge in a glass of wine.Consuming wine in moderation may reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular diseases in addition to improving your HDL (the ""good"" cholesterol) and protecting your coronary arteries.Many research studies have shown that consuming wine in the right quantities — one glass (5 oz) or less daily — has its benefits.Wine helps to dilate arteries and enhance the flow of blood in your body.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Exercise regularly.,
Walk and move more throughout the day.,
Eat mindfully.,
Manage stress.",How to Eat Well and Stay Healthy the Mediterranean Way," One of the main components of the Mediterranean diet is eating mostly-plant based foods.These types of foods should make up the majority of your diet.


Plant-based foods include a wide variety of foods — some that are high in protein, fiber and many vitamins and minerals.
Eat mostly: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils. You should include one or more of these food groups at each meal and snack.
Nuts and seeds are especially prevalent in the Mediterranean diet. They contain a significant amount of protein, minerals and heart-healthy fats. Include 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) per serving.
Another prevalent plant-based food in the Mediterranean diet are citrus fruits. Lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruits provide high amounts of Vitamin C, which has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant.;
, Another trademark characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is using a lot of olive oil.It's used both for cooking and for dressing different foods.


Butter is a less nutritious choice compared to olive oil because it's very high in saturated fat. Some studies have linked higher amounts of saturated fat to heart disease.Olive oil on the other hand is considered a superior and more nutritious type of fat. It's very high in monounsaturated fats which have been associated with decreased risk of heart disease.Even though olive oil is a healthier choice of fat, it's still a fat and should be measured when you're using it. One serving is one teaspoon and you should limit your servings to two to three per day., Red meat consumption is higher in the US compared to many other countries. The Mediterranean diet typically includes red meat only occasionally — maybe once or twice a month.Red meat has been associated with a variety of negative health effects when eaten in large quantities (like heart disease and diabetes). Recently, a study showed that high quantities of red meat are associated with a shortened life span.Substituting other protein sources (like tofu, beans, nuts or eggs) has been associated with decreased risk of heart disease and diabetes., Another great source of protein found in the Mediterranean diet is from dairy products. Add in a serving or two of these during the day.


Low-fat dairy contains a great deal of protein, but these foods also contain high amounts of calcium, vitamin D and potassium.Dairy products can include: yogurt, cheeses, milk or cottage cheese.
Measure out the correct serving of dairy foods. Indulge in 1/2 cup of yogurt, 1 oz of cheese or 6 oz of low-fat milk., In addition to consuming many different sources of plant-based proteins, the Mediterranean diet also emphasizes the consumption of fish and shellfish.Most Mediterranean-style diets recommend eating fish or shellfish at a minimum of twice per week.Include a 3-4 oz serving of fish or shellfish at dinner.
Many fish and shellfish are higher in omega-3 fats. This particular type of fat has been associated with decreased risk of heart disease, lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.Most seafood is a great choice, and fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines are particularly high in heart-healthy fats.

, Salt enhances the flavor of your foods, but using more herbs and spices like the Mediterranean diet does still adds a lot of flavor to your foods without the added sodium. Salt increases the risk of hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular disease or stroke. Herbs do not have any negative effects and are beneficial in the diet.Try: Basil: This herb is very high in essential oils and phenolic compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties and may improve chronic inflammation such as arthritis. It is also high in beta-carotene, lutein, and vitamin A, which do an exceptional job of protecting the body from free radicals.Marjoram: This plant has been used for a wide variety of ailments including colds, relieving menopause symptoms, stomach cramps and gas.Oregano: This herb has been associated with decreasing respiratory tract disorders, GI disorders, PMS symptoms and urinary tract infections. It is also rich in iron, dietary fiber, calcium, manganese, vitamin c, A, and omega-3 fatty acids.Parsley: This popular herb has been thought to help prevent cancer, diabetes, and improve bone health.It also contains high amounts of Vitamin A, K and C.

Sage: This herb may reduce cognitive ailments like Alzheimer’s and dementia in addition to possibly lowering blood glucose and cholesterol levels.Thyme: This herb may be effective against fungal infection, particularly those around your toenails. It also may help to reduce acne, high blood pressure and certain types of cancer.Mint: This plant may aid digestion, relieve seasonal allergies, prevent the common cold, and can help prevent bacteria growth in your mouth.Rosemary: This herb may boost your immune system and can aid digestion. It has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce the severity of asthma attacks and stimulates the flow of blood to your brain, which may improve cognitive issues.Garlic: This spice has been implicated in numerous health benefits like: decreased risk of heart disease and hardening of the arteries, decreasing high cholesterol, decreasing your risk for a heart attack and decreased risk of high blood pressure., Phenols in wine also help to reduce bad cholesterol. Try drinking one 5-ounce glass of wine per day if you drink alcohol., The portions typically served in the United States are much larger than necessary. When eaten, these large portions can contribute to excess calorie intake, weight gain and obesity.The Mediterranean diet features smaller portions. These smaller portions can help keep calories low and lead to weight loss or weight maintenance.
Measure portions of all foods. You can use a food scale or measuring cups to stay on track. Guesstimating or ""eye-balling"" portions generally leads to larger portions than necessary.
Protein foods should be 3-4 oz per portion, vegetables should be 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens, fruit should be 1/2 cup and grains should also be a 1/2 cup per serving., People in the countries bordering the Mediterranean are much more active than people in the US. Their increased activity level is partially why their lifestyle is considered very healthy.Physical activity has been associated with many health benefits including: increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL or the ""good"" cholesterol) levels, decreasing triglyceride levels, decreasing your risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, improving arthritis-related pain, and the reduction of some cancers.
Try to do moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least five times a week for 30 minutes during each session. This will help you meet the minimum guideline in the US of 150 minutes of physical activity weekly. Take up walking, running, biking, swimming, and hiking to get aerobic exercise.
In addition, incorporate two to three days of 20 minutes of strength training each week.
You should also try yoga or pilates that will help to build up your strength and flexibility.

, People that live in Mediterranean participate in more lifestyle activity compared to people in the US.Being more active throughout the day has been shown to have similar benefits to aerobic activity.Lifestyle activity are those exercises that you incorporate into your daily routine. For example, taking the stairs or mopping the floor are considered lifestyle activities.
People in the Mediterranean tend to have more lifestyle activity in their days. For example, they walk to and from destinations or ride their bikes instead of driving. Being active is a key part of their daily routines.
Think about your day, work schedule and overall week. Where can you fit in more movement or more steps? Can you ride your bike to work? Can you walk to the pharmacy or grocery store? Can you take the stairs instead of the elevator? Try to add in more steps in your day.

, Another aspect of a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle is that they typically eat more mindfully compared to the rushed lifestyles of the US.Eating mindfully can help you eat less, enjoy your food more and may even help you lose weight.Mindful eating is a style of eating. It's a way of eating that helps you become more aware of the types of foods you're eating, how much you're eating and how fast you're eating.
To eat more mindfully, try to: take 20 minutes to eat your meal, remove distractions from your eating area (like TVs or cell phones), take smaller bites, chew more thoroughly and tune into your body's sense of satiation of fullness.

, It can be difficult to manage chronic, lifestyle stress; however, studies have shown that people who live in the countries bordering the Mediterranean are better at stress management and have lower incidence of heart disease.Try to manage stress as best as you can. Try: listening to music, taking a walk, meditating, doing yoga or talking to a friend or family member.
If stress is too difficult to manage or you're unsure on how to start managing stress, consider seeing a life coach or therapist for additional help.

Know which injuries warrant immediate eye flushing.,
Call the Poison Control Center.,
Use an eyewash station.,
Wash for fifteen minutes.,
Use tap water If an eyewash station is unavailable.,
Get medical attention.",How to Wash Eyes With Water6," In some cases, like if you've introduced a serious irritant or contaminant to your eye, you shouldn't bother with sterile eye washes. Instead, your focus should be on immediately and thoroughly washing your eyes, then getting medical help. If you accidentally splash your eyes with a chemical that is an acid, an alkaline (base), a corrosive, or some other kind of irritant, immediately stop what you're doing and flush your eyes with water.

, You can reach the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222 for advice. They will advise you either to wash your eyes or seek immediate medical attention based on the chemical contaminant.For instance, some chemicals—such as most of the alkali metals—react violently with water. The Poison Control Center can easily identify the correct steps for you to take.
If they advise you to call 911 and also to rinse your eyes, have someone else around you call emergency services for you while you concentrate on rinsing your eyes. The quicker you can get to a hospital, the more likely you are to prevent serious injury or blindness.

, Most places where you can conceivably splash dangerous chemicals in your eye will come equipped with special eye wash stations designed for just such a situation.Proceed immediately to the eyewash station, depress the lever (which should be brightly marked and easily accessed), and place your face in front of the water spouts, which will spray water at a low pressure. Keep your eyes as wide open as possible. You may want to use your fingers to keep them wide open.

, Water doesn't neutralize many chemicals. It simply dilutes them and washes them away. For this reason, a large quantity is needed. The volume of wash delivered should not be less than 1.5 liters/minute (0.4 gallons/minute) for fifteen minutes., If you can't immediately find an eyewash station, proceed to the nearest sink as quickly as you can. Tap water isn't ideal for eye washing, as it's not as sterile as the purified water used in many laboratories, but it's far more important to rinse the chemicals from your eyes than it is to worry about possible infections.Splash water into your open eyes as generously as you can. Continue for at least 15–20 minutes.If your sink has an adjustable faucet, point it directly into your eye at a low pressure and a lukewarm temperature and hold your eyes open with your fingers.

, If the Poison Control Center has advised you to see a medical professional once you’ve done the immediate eye rinsing, then seek medical attention.

Understand what conjunctivitis is.,
Identify symptoms of conjunctivitis.,
Apply a compress.,
Use lubricating eyedrops.,
Avoid wearing contact lenses.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Ask your doctor about a course of antibiotics.",How to Treat Eye Infection Naturally1," Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is highly infectious. The two main types of conjunctivitis are bacterial and viral, and both are typically spread by hand-to-eye contact or sharing contact items like pillows or eye makeup. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis, but unfortunately, antibiotics will be useless in treating viral conjunctivitis. The virus simply has to run its course, which usually takes between two and three weeks.The best way to naturally treat pink eye is to treat the symptoms. This will lesson your discomfort and help you regain some control over how you feel.


Viral conjunctivitis is typically caused by adenoviruses, picornaviruses, rubella, rubeola, and herpes viruses.Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically caused by staphylococcus, haemophilus, streptococcus, and moraxella. It is often spread by contact with fecal bacteria.;
, The most common side effects of conjunctivitis are redness (hence the name ""pink eye""), itchiness, discharge that forms a crust over the eyelids while sleeping, and a persistent feeling of grittiness or irritation., Try cold and warm water compresses (but not too hot) to determine what works best for you.


Run a clean washcloth or hand towel under the faucet. Start with cool water, as this is generally considered the most soothing option.Wring out the towel.
Apply to the eye or eyes, depending on the extent of your conjunctivitis.
Lie down and let the cold compress sit on your eye(s) for as long as necessary until the pain and irritation subside, rewetting as needed.

, Though over-the-counter eyedrops won't treat the infection, they may help reduce redness and irritation. Follow the instructions for how often to apply lubricating eyedrops.


Wash your hands before and after touching the area around your eyes.Lie on your back before applying eyedrops.
Squeeze one drop at a time into the affected eye or eyes.
Close eyes immediately after application, and keep them closed for approximately two to three minutes., Contacts can trap conjunctivitis against the eyes and prolong the symptoms of this infection. Throw away any disposable contacts that have come in contact with infected eyes., Anyone can get pink eye at any stage in life. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. The most important thing is preventing its spread, and preventing it from happening again.Wash your hands with soap and warm water often. This is especially important to do prior to touching your face or eyes.
Do not share makeup products, washcloths, or face towels.
Throw away any cosmetic items and disposable contact lenses that may have been infected.
Wash any bedding that may have come in contact with your face during a conjunctivitis outbreak.

, If the infection is bacterial, your doctor may prescribe a round of antibiotics to help treat your conjunctivitis outbreak.

Learn about what glaucoma is and how it's treated.,
Learn about the different types of glaucoma.,
Learn the symptoms of glaucoma.,
Understand open-angle glaucoma.,
Understand closed-angle glaucoma.,
Understand the risk factors for glaucoma.",How to Treat Glaucoma1," Understanding glaucoma in detail can help patients adhere to a treatment plan. Glaucoma is a group of diseases which damage the optic nerve.Glaucoma can be caused by an increase in eye pressure, but it can also occur without an increase in eye pressure (known as low-tension or normal-tension glaucoma). The treatment of glaucoma is focused on reducing the pressure in the eyeball, called the intraocular pressure (IOP) or eye blood pressure. This should be done with medical supervision.


In a normally functioning eye, a fluid called aqueous humor is produced in the posterior (rear) chamber of eye. It then travels to the anterior (front) chamber of eye by passing the pupil where it exchanges contents with the cornea and lens. It exits to the system where the recirculation will cycle through the eye again.;
, There are two main types of glaucoma: open angle and closed angle. Both types of the disease are characterized by progressive optic nerve damage that is sometimes related to an increase in eye pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure., The two main types of glaucoma have completely different symptoms. The symptoms of open-angle glaucoma include tunnel vision, or the gradual loss of peripheral vision. The symptoms of acute closed-angle glaucoma include eye pain, nausea and vomiting, sudden loss of sight, blurred vision, light halos, and red eyes., Open-angle is the most common type of glaucoma, responsible for 90% of cases of glaucoma. In open-angle glaucoma, there is either a lack of cells in the trabecular network, the cells that are available are not functioning correctly, or the trabecular meshwork may be partially clogged, causing slower than normal drainage of aqueous humour. Without an exit for the fluid, the result is an accumulation of aqueous humour in eye, thus increasing the intraocular pressure. This results in a suffocating optic nerve. The complication of this is diminished vision ultimately leading to blindness if left untreated.Some symptoms of open-angle glaucoma are slow or gradual vision loss and painless change of vision.
Many people do not have any other symptoms; therefore, it is important to maintain eye doctor appointments to regularly test the pressure inside your eye. Diagnosis cannot be made without testing IOP., Closed-angle glaucoma is caused by aqueous humour accumulation causing a bulging iris, thus physically obstructing aqueous humour drainage. Unlike open-angle glaucoma, it is a painful situation. Generally, it is acute in nature; however, chronic cases are also possible.


This is a medical emergency and you should be immediately taken to the nearest medical facility.
Patients with open-angle glaucoma should be cautious when administering eye drops, because any drops that dilate pupils can result in closed-angle glaucoma. Before administering drops ask an eye care professional if it is advisable. If you do experience pain with drops and vision changes, go to the nearest medical facility and inform your doctor., Understanding risk factors for glaucoma can help patients keep an eye on warning signs and symptoms if they are at higher risk. Those who are older than 40 are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma. This is due to the natural aging of cells in the trabecular meshwork, making them more prone to accumulation of aqueous humour. Diabetics are twice as likely to develop glaucoma than non-diabetics.


Environmental stress can also become a factor. Exposure to pollutants, such as smoke or UV light, without proper protection can cause an increased amount of free radicals. Free radicals are molecules that have unstable electrons — they have an odd, unpaired electron. This unstable molecule attempts to stabilize by attacking a healthy molecule, trying to steal an electron. This turns the attacked molecule into a free radical, an so on. Eventually, this reaction can damage the cell."

Add omega-3 fatty acids to your diet.",How to Treat Eye Infection Naturally2," Sty is typically seen as a red swollen spot on or near the eyelid, often filled with pus. Sty occurs when the oil glands present in the eyelid become infected, most often by staphylococcus. There are two types of sty: hordeolum, which infects the either the sweat glands or sebaceous glands in the eyelid, and chalazion, which specifically infects the meibomian sebaceous gland in the eyelid.The infection will typically clear up on its own, but can be quite painful in the meantime., The most common symptoms typically include:


A small, red swelling on or near the eyelid that may resemble a pimple.
Pain and irritation on or around the eyelid.
Excessive tear production., Anyone can develop an eye infection like sty, but there are certain activities that increase the likelihood of an infection.Anyone who touches his eyes and face without washing his hands first may become infected with sty.
Anyone wearing contacts that have not been disinfected prior to use may be at risk of developing sty.
Anyone who wears eye makeup on overnight without washing or wiping it off before bed may be at risk of developing sty.
Some patients with preexisting conditions like rosacea, a skin condition, or blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelid may have a higher risk of developing sty., Do not try to pop the sty. This may cause the infection to worsen, and could allow it to spread., The best way to treat sty is to address the symptoms while you wait for the infection to heal.


Wash the infection gently. Do not scrub or excessively rub the sty.
Use a warm washcloth compress. Re-wet as needed for five to ten minutes.
Do not wear contact lenses or eye makeup until the infection has cleared up., Increasing your daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids may relieve some of the symptoms of a sty infection by increasing sebaceous gland production."

Consider antibiotics.",How to Treat Eye Infection Naturally3," Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of one or both eyelids. It is not contagious and is often caused by bacterial infection (staphylococcal) or by long-term skin conditions like dandruff or rosacea. It can also be caused by excessive oil production in the eyelid, which leads to bacterial infection. The two main types of blepharitis are anterior, which affects the outer edge of the eyelid, and posterior, which affects the inner edge., The most common symptoms of blepharitis include:


redness
irritation
watery eyes
sticky eyelids
sensitivity to light
persistent itching
the presence of flaky ""scales""., Anyone of any age can contract blepharitis, though people with pre-existing skin conditions like dandruff or rosacea are often at a higher risk., There is no medication used to treat blepharitis, so the best course of action is to treat the symptoms to reduce pain and irritation.


Use a warm washcloth compress. Re-wet as needed for five to ten minutes, several times each day.Gently wash your eyelids with a non-irritating baby shampoo to remove crusts and flakes. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off the eyes and face after washing.Avoid wearing contact lenses and eye makeup during an outbreak.
Massage eyelid glands as needed to release excess oil. Always wash hands before and after touching the eyes., Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic, such as azithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, or tetracycline to treat your blepharitis infection."

Understand what keratitis is.,
Identify the symptoms of keratitis.,
Understand who is at risk of keratitis.,
Treat keratitis.",How to Treat Eye Infection Naturally4," Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea in any part of the cornea and conjunctiva, in one or both eyes and may be caused by infection. Symptoms may be short lived, or they may be chronic. Symptoms typically include pain and redness, irritation, discharge or excessive tears, difficulty opening eyes, blurred or decreased visual abilities, and sensitivity to light. See a doctor immediately if you suspect you may have keratitis. Delays in the treatment of keratitis may lead to permanent blindness.There are several types of keratitis, each differentiated by its cause.Bacterial keratitis is typically caused by infection with Staphylococci, Haemophilus, Streptococci, or Pseudomonas bacteria. Bacterial infection frequently follows some type of surface damage to the cornea, and may cause ulcers to form at the site of infection.Viral keratitis can be caused by a number of viruses, including the common cold. It may also be caused by introduction of the herpes simplex virus, or by the herpes zoster virus, which causes the chickenpox and shingles.Fungal keratitis is frequently caused by Fusarium spores, which tend to grow in unclean contact lenses. People with compromised immune systems may contract keratitis from Candida, Aspergillus, or Nocardia fungal spores, though these are quite rare in otherwise healthy individuals.Chemical keratitis is caused by chemical exposure, either from over wear of contact lenses, splashing of chemicals or fumes, or submersion in irritating chemicals, such as swimming pools and hot tubs.Physical keratitis is caused by trauma to the eyes through a number of sources, including prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light and to the light from welding torches.Onchocercal keratitis is caused by a parasitic amoeba that may afflict patients who wear contact lenses. This form of keratitis causes what's known as ""river blindness"". It is extensively seen in third world countries, but is quite rare in other parts of the world.Keratitis sicca and Filamentary keratitis are superficial inflammations caused by extremely dry eyes and irritation in the tear film., Symptoms typically include:


pain
redness
irritation
discharge or excessive tears
difficulty opening eyes
blurred or decreased visual abilities
sensitivity to light., Anyone can become afflicted with keratitis, but certain factors make some people more predisposed toward developing types of keratitis.


Anyone with damage to the surface of the cornea may be at a higher risk.Wearing contact lenses may increase the risk of keratitis.Chronic or severe dry eyes may lead to a higher risk.Compromised immune systems caused by AIDS or by certain types of medication like corticosteroids or chemotherapy may lead to a higher risk., See your doctor immediately to receive antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral medication to treat keratitis. Your doctor may also prescribe a course of steroids to treat the inflammation associated with keratitis.Once you've been to the doctor, there are a number of ways you can treat the symptoms at home, in conjunction with the medication your doctor prescribes to you.Use lubricating eyedrops. Though over-the-counter eyedrops won't treat the infection, they may help reduce redness and irritation. Follow the instructions for how often to apply lubricating eyedrops, and let your doctor know about this and any over-the-counter medications you plan to use on your eyes.
Stop wearing contact lenses while experiencing keratitis. Discard disposable contact lenses that may have been worn while keratitis was active.

Treat the symptoms.",How to Treat Eye Infection Naturally5," Allergies can cause a non-contagious form of conjunctivitis. This type of eye infection can be caused by pet allergies, or by environmental allergens like pollen, grass, dust, and mold.

, Symptoms typically include:


itchy, irritated eyes
redness and swelling
excessive tearing., Anyone can develop allergic conjunctivitis. The biggest risk factor is having a known seasonal/environmental allergy.

, Taking an over-the-counter decongestant or antihistamine may help reduce the symptoms of an allergic eye irritation. Your doctor or pharmacist may also recommend an over-the-counter mast-cell stabilizer, such as ophthalmic lodoxamide, to treat the general symptoms of an allergic irritation., Your doctor may recommend that you take an antihistamine to calm your body's reaction to the allergen(s) at hand. Some home remedies may help reduce the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.


Flush the eyes with clean water. Some users may find cool water is more soothing, while others might prefer using lukewarm water.Use cool, wet tea bags. After you've finished a cup of tea, save the tea bag. Once it's cool, apply to affected eye(s) for around ten to fifteen minutes. Repeat up to three times each day.Try using a cold washcloth compress. This may help ease the irritation and inflammation that accompany allergic conjunctivitis.

Learn some relaxation techniques and exercises.,
Try focusing or zooming your eyes.,
Eat the right diet.,
Limit your fluid intake, especially of caffeine.,
Use over-the-counter eye drops.",How to Treat Glaucoma2," Some eye exercises can relieve stress and can help relax and strengthen your eyes. Although eyestrain doesn't cause glaucoma, people who suffer from glaucoma should reduce strain on their eyes in order to accommodate the low amount of aqueous humour exiting in relation to its production. The great part is these are things you can do at home or anywhere you are as long as you are comfortable. Here are some examples:Blinking provides a break for our eyes, but is often disregarded due to our heavy and long workloads. This may seem unnecessary to think about, but eyestrain makes this a concern. Blinking helps lubricate your eyes by spreading tear film evenly and can help eyestrain due to eye dryness.Blinking cleanses eyes by mechanically pushing toxins out with tears.You should blink once every four seconds to spread tear film and prevent tired eyes due to dryness.
Palming can be done by simply taking your palms and using them to cover your closed eyes for a few minutes. Sit comfortably in a chair with your back straight. Put your elbows on a table — on top of pillow for added comfort. Cup each hand and close eyes. Place the right cupped hand over the right closed eye, and the left cupped hand over the left closed eye. Breathe normally and relax with your palms on your eyes for five to 10 minutes.Practice tracing figure eights with your eyes. This exercise helps your eye muscles and increases their flexibility. Imagine a horizontal figure eight or infinity sign in front of you. Trace the eight with only your eyes slowly, about ten times, without moving your head.
These methods should be done together. As a result of patient's commitment to these exercises, patients can experience less eyestrain. Do these exercises for about 20 minutes a day, four to five times a week, or at the advice of orthoptic specialist., By focusing on objects at different distances, you can provide some relief to eyestrain. For example, eyestrain can occur when focusing on monitors or screens for long periods of time. A simple break to perform this technique can also remind you to blink, thus hydrating eyes.



Focusing. Simply find a relaxing place to sit. Put your thumb in front of you, around 10 inches (25.4 cm) away and try to focus your eyes on it. After a few seconds try to focus on something else again, around 10 to 20 feet (3.0 to 6.1 m) away from you. Don’t forget a deep breath before you switch focus in your eyes!

Zooming. This improves your focusing skills and also strengthens your eye muscles. Try to work again with your thumb. Put your thumb in front of you with your arms outstretched and after a few seconds try to bring it near, around 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from your eye. Do this for a few minutes., Eating healthy cannot cure glaucoma but some nutrients and vitamins from healthy foods can help you improve your eyesight. Here are some foods that are good for the eyes:Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which is good for smooth eye function.
Green, leafy vegetables and egg yolks are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, both powerful antioxidants.
Citrus fruits and berries are rich in Vitamin C.
Almonds are high in vitamin E which are antioxidants.
Fatty fish is rich in DHA and omega-3s and great for overall eye health.

, Since you are experiencing eye pressure, drinking several fluids at a given time can temporarily increase eye fluid buildup, leading to pressure. Instead, stick to a steady stream of water to keep hydrated.


Limit drinking caffeine as it can contribute in increasing eye pressure, too. That means decaffeinated sodas and only decaffeinated coffees and teas. Read the label first to be sure!
One cup of coffee a day is thought to be a safe amount. It is not clear how much or why coffee may increase intraocular pressure; however, coffee does have an effect on blood flow and the vessels that feed the eyeball. Many health professionals recommend limiting coffee to a cup a day even though the exact mechanism is not well understood.
Some evidence suggests that aerobic exercise can also help to reduce IOP. Exercise can reduce systemic high blood pressure and is overall helpful to maintain a healthy lifestyle., Lubricating eye drops are only for relief of eyestrain and not to treat glaucoma. They simply treat related dry eye. See your eye doctor for more information on relieving eyestrain with a preexisting condition.


Artificial tears can only provide supplemental care and not a substitute for natural tears.
Artificial tears can help alleviate dryness by replacing the layer of tear film that helps keep eyes moist and tears spread evenly throughout surface of eye.
Eye ointments can comfort due to their lubricating effect and are particularly useful during extended periods when artificial tears cannot be applied.
Over-the-counter eye drops (such as Systane) are administered about four to six times daily or as needed."

Alternatively, look into carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.,
Consider using an adrenergic agonist.,
Consider surgery if all else fails.",How to Treat Glaucoma3," Medicated eye drops are the most common way of treating glaucoma.These require a prescription so the eye doctor can regularly check eye pressure as well as any complications that may occur. Over-the-counter eye drops are not recommended in combination with prescription eye drops. Prescription eye drops can lower eye pressure by slowly improving fluid drainage in your eyes. These are usually taken every day, of course with the guidance of an ophthalmologist.


If this sounds like a convenient solution for you, talk to your doctor. She will be able to set you up with the kind that is right for you.

, This type of eye drop is used to reduce the fluid in the eyes. Examples of this drug include timolol (Betimol) betaxolol (Betoptic), and metipranolol (OptiPranolol). These are usually given one drop, once or twice daily.


The side effects of this eye drop may include breathing problems, hair loss, fatigue, depression, memory loss, a drop in blood pressure, and impotence., This eye drop has replaced beta-blockers as the most common eye drop used because it does have fewer side effects. This drop, usually given one per day, increases fluid flow in the eye and reduces eye pressure.


Its possible side effects include a reddening and stinging feeling in the eyes, a little swell in the outer part of the eye and the iris of the eye becoming dark. The color of the eyelids may also change., These are also called miotics because they narrow the size of the pupils. On the other hand, they help with glaucoma by increasing fluid flow in the eye. Common examples are pilocarpine and carbachol.


Possible side effects are having smaller pupils (less intake of light), blurred vision, an aching brow, and an increased risk of retinal detachment.
These eye drops are infrequently used anymore as a treatment for glaucoma because it usually requires one drop, three to four times a day. Rather it is now commonly used to keep pupils smaller prior to laser iridotomy — in other words, conditions unrelated to glaucoma., These eye drops reduce fluid production in the eyes.Drug examples are Trusopt and Azopt, with one drop taken two to three times a day. These drugs can also be use as pills in eliminating body fluid, including in the eyes.


Possible side effects may include nausea, eye irritation, dry mouth, frequent urination, tingling in the fingers/toes, and a strange taste in the mouth., These eye drops both reduce fluid flow in the eye and at the same time increase the fluid drainage in the eye. Usually one drop is needed per day. Drug examples are Alphagan, Propine and Iopidine. These are not commonly used, as 12% of users may have an allergic reaction.


Possible side effects may include irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, fatigue, red, itchy or swollen eyes, and dry mouth.

, Surgical intervention for glaucoma is done if eye drops or drugs don’t work, or if the person cannot tolerate the drugs' side effects. The main reason for surgery is to improve the fluid flow in the eye to lower eye pressure. Sometimes, your initial surgery does not lower eye pressure enough, requiring you to have a second surgery or to still continue using eye drops. The different kinds of eye surgery are as follows:



Drainage implants. Implants are usually done for children and for those suffering from advanced glaucoma and secondary glaucoma.

Laser surgery. Trabeculoplasty is a laser surgery that uses a high-energy laser beam to open blocked drainage canals and let the fluid run easily in the eyes.

Laser iridotomy. These are for people with very narrow drainage angles. A small hole is created on the top part or side of the iris for improved fluid flow.

Filtering Surgery. In this procedure, a surgeon creates an opening in the sclera (the white part of the eye) and removes a small piece of tissue in the base of the cornea where fluid goes out, allowing the fluid to flow freely out of the eye.

Genetics and body structure play the biggest role in whether you can gain a thigh gap. Simply put, most women have hips that are set too closely together for there to be a large gap between their thighs, even with very little fat on their legs. If you have wider set hips, however, a thigh gap might actually be possible while maintaining a healthy overall weight.;
, Dieting and exercise will not give you a thigh gap overnight — it is a long-term lifestyle change, not a quick fix. Physical results could take as long as three to four weeks to start showing. Even then, some girls' genetics keep them from achieving a thigh gap, no matter how skinny they are. Whatever the case, it is not healthy to achieve a thigh gap by skipping meals or by exerting yourself to exhaustion.


Stay motivated by noticing the ways in which a healthy diet makes you feel better, instead of simply looking better. You might have more energy, or notice that your clothes fit in a more flattering way. It may not be what you wanted, but learning to be happy with who you are is a skill you will need to develop whoever you are.

, Getting a thigh gap has become the Holy Grail for some. They need it or they feel inadequate. In serious cases, people focus on it so much that they begin to lose perspective about other important things in life, like health or maintaining social relationships. A troubling number of teens and young girls are treating a thigh gap in an unhealthy way, fasting and possibly developing eating disorders.Don't let the prospect of a thigh gap make or break you. Your thighs do not say anything about you. Do not let anyone tell you what to do.

, If you are after a thigh gap, but the only way you feel you can get there is starving your body of the nutrients it needs to stay healthy, please ask for help. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating disorders are serious to your physical health and mental well-being.


Especially during your teen years, not getting enough food can have serious health consequences. It affects brain development, heart function, and even reproductive health in a bad way.Pay attention to these signs that your eating may be turning into a disorder. Do you feel powerful when you skip meals? Do you lie about how much you eat? Are you deathly afraid of gaining weight? Is your self-worth primarily derived from your body weight?If you've answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, see a medical professional or talk to someone who can help you right away.

, If your hips are wide set, you're more likely to be able to get a thigh gap.If you happen to be one of the many girls whose hips are not wide set, exercising or diet may not make a thigh gap possible. However, exercise and diet do, to some extent, have an effect on your thighs; the influence of genetics in relation to thigh gap is not as irreversible as its relation to bone structure.

, Try to slowly chip away at any excess weight through a combination of diet and exercise until you hit your doctor-recommended BMI. If you still have not gotten a thigh gap, it may not be possible given your genes and bone structure.


Even with exercise, it's impossible to target just one area on your body, such as your thighs. This myth is called spot training.Targeted training, say in your thigh area, does work, by taking flab and turning it into muscle, but you'll also be losing flab in other areas as well. You cannot tell your body to burn fat from a particular area on your body just by working it out.

, Instead of restricting your intake, try focusing on eating healthy items that fuel your body (and do not satisfy your sweet tooth). Consider cleaning these items out of your diet:


Trans-fats: These sneaky fats contribute to heart disease and high cholesterol, and are abundant in fast food, processed snack foods (such as potato chips), fried food and shortening or margarine. If you are not sure, check out the nutrition facts.
Sugar: Processed sugar packs many calories without much nutritional benefit. Do not use artificial sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame or saccharine in your beverages, as some recent studies have shown possible dangerous side effects of these products e.g. some artificial sweeteners found in Diet drinks can increase your risk of a heart attack. Instead, try substituting unsweetened applesauce for sugar in recipes., Not only is fiber good for you, it takes a while to digest and will fill up more space in your stomach, resulting in feeling less hungry.Try these sources:


Fruits and vegetables: Common choices include celery, apples, spinach, cabbage, berries, carrots, pears and oranges (and many others!).
Whole grains: Reach for brown grains instead of white ones: whole-wheat bread, brown rice, wheat tortillas, and wheat pasta.
Eat nuts and beans. Try black beans, almonds, pistachios, pecans and lentils.

, The jury is still out regarding the effectiveness of superfoods regarding weight loss, but many of these foods are part of a healthy diet, anyway, so you do not have much to lose by choosing them over other higher calorie alternatives.


Superfoods that might be worth adding to your diet include:

Apples, goji berries, blueberries, and pomegranates
Eggs, lentils, almond butter, salmon, and sardines
Oats, buckwheat pasta, and quinoa
Kale, chiles, tarragon, and avocado
Low-fat plain yogurt, and parmesan cheese
Olive oil



, If you are eating a healthy diet, but still feel like you are not quite where you would like to be, review what you are consuming every day. Even small restrictions, like eating 200 fewer calories per day, can lead to safe, gradual weight loss.


Keep a food diary. You can write it down the old-fashioned way and look up calories online, or use an app like MyFitnessPal or Spark People. Whatever you choose, try to be consistent.
Figure out your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This will tell you how many calories per day you burn simply by existing. To lose weight at a safe pace, try cutting back your diet to 200 or 300 calories less than your BMR. 3500 calories is equal to 1 pound, so by cutting out 300, you should be dropping 1 pound every 11 days.

Move past mistakes. If you give in to temptation, do not be discouraged! Everyone slips up once in a while. Simply resolve to get back to your healthy diet.

, Sit down on the floor, with your back straight and upright. Bend your knees outward, and put the soles of your feet together. Draw your feet as close to your pelvis as you can without straining, and try to lower your thighs so they are parallel to the ground. Hold for five to 10 seconds.


You might need to hold your feet with your hands to do this stretch. That's OK!
Be gentle. You may have seen people doing this stretch by flapping their knees vigorously up and down, like butterfly wings, but that is a quick way to injure yourself. Instead, aim to keep your movements slow and precise.
Do a butterfly stretch before you start working out your thighs — it'll help loosen them up and prevent muscle tears.

, Lie down on your left side, with your head either resting on your left arm or supported by your left hand. Bend your right knee, and lift it over your left leg so your right shin is resting on the floor. Keep your left leg straight as you breathe out and lift a few inches, and then inhale as you lower it. Do three sets of 10 repetitions on each side.


Try to keep your torso as straight and still as possible as you lift your legs.
Move slowly. You will notice the slower your movements are, the more they will work your thighs.
If you have a back injury, clear this exercise with your doctor before doing it.

, You can do this exercise sitting at your desk, or try a more complicated version on the floor:


Sitting press: Sit up straight in your chair, with your back straight and your abs pulled in. Place a towel, pillow, or other small object between your knees. Squeeze it between your knees as tightly as you can, and hold for a few seconds. Do 20 repetitions.
Bridge press: Lie down on your back, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Put something like a pillow, towel, or other soft object between your knees. Lift your pelvis until you are in bridge position (that is, the line running from the back of your knees to your shoulders is as straight as possible), and squeeze the object between your knees as tightly as you can. Do 20 repetitions before lowering yourself back to the ground.

, You should aim to get 30 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise at least 3 days a week. Not only will these exercises keep you healthy and help you slim down, they will also tone up your legs in the process.


Running, walking briskly, climbing stairs, biking, swimming, and dancing can all help you slim down your legs.Find an exercise that you enjoy and stick with it. If you enjoy your workout, you will be more likely to do it regularly.

, These include squats, lunges, leg curls, and calf raises, among others. While these exercises are great for building muscle and toning up, they will not slim your legs down or help you achieve a thigh gap.


You don't have to avoid these exercises, but do them in moderation. Focus instead on cardio exercises that work your entire body.

, If you need a thigh gap by tonight, then your best option is to try on thigh-slimming shapewear.


Your best options are a good pair of tights with a control top and a snug body shaper. Make sure that any body shaper you buy extends far enough down to cover the entire thigh.

, These creams and cosmetic ointments claim to get rid of unwanted cellulite with consistent application. Since much thigh fat tends to be cellulite, some products could potentially prove helpful.


Many of these creams contain caffeine. Caffeine stimulates blood flow and may help burn off cellulite, so applying an anti-cellulite cream with caffeine in it to your thighs might help reduce any cellulite clinging to that area of your legs.

, This process involves brushing your thighs with a specialized brush to stimulate blood flow and speed up fat loss.


Use a special dry brush designed for this technique. These brushes are available from many health and beauty stores. Do not use a standard hairbrush.
Dry brushing helps exfoliate dead skin and, theoretically, improves circulation while tightening your skin.

, While self-tanner may not be able to give you a thigh gap, if you need to show off your legs in a swimsuit or mini-skirt, you can use self-tanner to create the illusion of slimmer thighs and toner legs.


Spray a self-tanner or bronzer over your legs from top to bottom. You might be tempted to only apply the tanner to your thighs to create the illusion of shadows, but the difference in hue between your thighs and calves will usually look unnatural, so you'll need to cover the entire leg.

, If an elegant thigh gap picture is what you are after, you do not necessarily have to starve and put your body through agony. By trying this simple trick, you could get the look you are after with a whole lot less work.

, Pretend they are stiff as straw and hard as rock.

, Not too much, or what you are doing will become apparent. A little goes a long way here.

, Tip the back part of your heels apart, making sure to keep the front part of your toes together. Remember to do this subtle or it will not look natural or believable.

, If your camera is facing a downward angle, all the better. You should have recreated the thigh gap without much fuss and with minimal effort. Use this pose to enhance your thigh gap if you naturally have one.

, The surest way to a thigh gap, regardless of weight, is widened hips. If you're not quite through puberty, it's possible that your pelvis simply isn't wide enough yet. Most girls finish developing around the age of 16 or 17, but puberty can continue into the later teens in some cases. . Try to be patient!


Don't resort to starving. Puberty involves much growth and change, and you need plenty of nutrients and calories to pull it off. If you deprive yourself, you will stunt the development of your figure.
Accept that puberty takes years, not months. You might have a sudden growth spurt over a summer, but the physical transition from childhood to adulthood takes years. Try not to be discouraged if your development is taking longer than other girls you know.

, If you are 15 and have not menstruated yet, consider seeing a gynecologist . You might have another health condition that's delaying puberty.


If you suspect that your hormones are seriously out of balance, make an appointment with a gynecologist or reproductive endocrinologist. A simple blood test can tell you a lot about what is wrong, and your doctor can prescribe the appropriate medications from there.

Cut out about 500 – 750 calories daily from your diet. This small decrease in calories can help you lose about 1 – 1.5 pounds per week.Aiming to lose more weight than this per week is generally not advised by health professionals.
Use a food journal or online tracker to get an idea of how many calories you currently eat daily. Subtract 500 – 750 from that total to get an idea of how many calories you should consume daily to result in moderate weight loss.;
, Studies have shown that following a lower carbohydrate diet can not only help you lose weight quickly, but specifically decrease the amount of stomach fat you have.Fill up on 3 – 4 oz of lean protein at each meal (about the size of a deck of cards).
Choose mostly non-starchy vegetables (like peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, cauliflower or lettuce) and aim for a serving or two at each meal. Have 1 – 2 cups of leafy greens.
Eat one to two servings of fruit daily. Fruit contains natural sugars and should be eaten in correct portion sizes — 1/2 cup for most fruits or one medium piece.
Examples of lower carb meals include: mixed green salad with raw vegetables, 5 oz of grilled chicken and an oil-based dressing, 1 cup greek yogurt with nuts and 1/2 cup of fruit, or grilled salmon with a small salad and steamed broccoli.

, Foods like bread, rice and pasta can be a part of a healthy diet; however, these foods are significantly higher in carbohydrates than other foods. Limit these to help you stick to your lower calorie diet.


Foods to limit include: bread, rice, pasta, crackers, chips, tortillas, English muffins, etc.
Limit portion sizes to 1 oz or 1/2 cup. Do not avoid grains altogether. Choose grains with lots of nutrition and that will keep you full, like quinoa or oatmeal.
In addition, aim to choose 100% whole grain options. These foods are higher in fiber and other nutrients that are apart of a healthy diet.

, Studies have shown that sugar (especially added sugar) is one of the main culprits in excess stomach fat.Limit foods high in sugars.


Added sugars are those that companies add to a product during the manufacturing process. For example, cookies or ice cream have added sugar, which you might expect, but items like crackers, juice, pasta sauce can also have a lot of added sugar.Natural sugar is not added and is contained naturally in foods. For example, fruit has some sugar, but it's natural sugar. Foods with natural sugar are much better choices as they generally have more essential nutrients.Get in the habit of reading food labels, and beware of hidden sugars in any packaged foods. Learn the different names for added sugar and note that there may be multiple forms of sugar added to one product.
If you have a sweet tooth, choose healthy options like honey, dark chocolate, dried fruit, and Greek yogurt to satisfy your cravings.

, Staying hydrated is crucial to maintaining your body's normal functions and studies have shown that drinking plenty of water can also help you shed pounds faster.This is partially due to the fact that water helps keep you full so that you eat less.
Aim to drink at least eight to 13 glasses of water per day. Drink one to two glasses before each meal to help curb your appetite and make you fuller faster.

, Some studies have shown that if you work out in the morning, prior to eating your first meal, many of the calories you burn come from fat (instead of stored glycogen).To work out in the morning, you actually won't need to get up all that earlier. Try just setting your alarm 30 – 60 minutes earlier than you typically do.
Some other benefits of working out in the morning include: missing after work gym crowds, getting your exercise out of the way, free afternoons and a more focused day.

, Cardiovascular exercises burn calories and help speed up your metabolism so that you can lose weight faster.You should get at least 150 minutes total of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week, which you can break up into 30 minutes five days a week. If you're trying to lose visceral fat, however, some experts suggest getting up to 60 minutes a day.Exercises can include jogging, walking briskly, cycling, swimming, and hiking, dancing
Try to find an exercise that you enjoy. If your workouts are fun, then you are far more likely to stick with them.

, Incorporating a few days of resistance or strength training is also important. This will help tone muscle and maintain lean muscle mass while you're dieting.It's recommended to include about two to three days of strength training each week. Make sure to do exercises that work your entire body and all major muscle groups.Although you cannot spot-treat, incorporating some strength training exercises that focus on your core (back and abdominal muscles) can help support the look of a toner, leaner stomach. Do exercises like: the plank, crunches, or v-sits.

, Studies have shown that people who do high-intensity interval training (HITT) lose more fat around their stomach compared to regular cardiovascular exercise.HIIT is a type of exercise that is done for shorter periods of time, but works your body harder. You alternate between short bursts of very high-intensity exercises with bouts of more moderate-intensity exercises.
Include one to two days of HIIT each week. This can count as your cardio exercise as well — it is recommended to get 75 minutes total of high-intensity exercise each week.

, Stress causes an increase in cortisol, a hormone that causes the body to store extra fat, particularly in the midsection.Stress can also cause emotional eating, or eating for comfort rather than out of hunger.


Try eliminate or reduce stress-provoking people and things from your life, if possible.
You can also reduce the amount of stress and anxiety you feel on a daily basis by better managing your time so that you aren't constantly rushing to meet your deadlines.
If you struggle with stress, take a few minutes every day to sit down, close your eyes, focus on your breath, and clear your head of all of your thoughts and preoccupations.

, Studies have shown that lack of sleep can wreak havoc on your appetite and body fat. When you don't get enough sleep you run the risk of weight gain and increased fat around your stomach.The recommendation is to get at least seven to nine hours nightly for adults. This amount will help maintain your health but also help you feel well rested.
Make sure to turn off all the lights. Turn off any electronic devices (like phones, tablets or computers) at least two hours before bed.

, Losing weight on your own can be difficult, especially when people around you are eating unhealthy things.


Find a friend to diet with so that you can help keep each other motivated, share tips and tricks, and keep each other company while exercising.
Studies have shown that people lose more weight and keep it off longer when they have a good support group., Studies have shown that people who keep track of the food they eat by writing it down tend to lose weight faster, and keep it off, than those who don't.This is partially due to the fact that writing things down forces you to be held accountable for your decisions. Make sure to be as accurate as you can with your journaling.
Try using an online calorie calculator/diary or just keeping a handwritten journal. Apps such as MyFitnessPal and other websites help you keep track of the foods you eat and allow you to look up the calorie content of various foods.

, Track your progress by taking measurements of your waistline or weight before you start dieting.


Weigh yourself daily or weekly to see what progress you've made over time. Try to weigh yourself at the same time of day and wearing the same clothes for the most accurate reflection of progress.
Weighing yourself daily may help you quickly identify any issues with your weight loss regimen — if you see the scale creeping up, you can go back through your journal to see if you are overeating, or you can increase your cardio, all before you gain too much weight.Also periodically re-measure your waist or hips to see how much fat you've lost around your stomach.

You cannot lose fat mass from one specific area of your body, but losing weight in general can reduce your overall body fat levels.Over time, you'll notice your love handles will get smaller.
Cut out about 500 calories a daily. This generally results in a 1 – 2 pound loss each week.Start counting calories for an entire day (try a food diary or using an app like MyFitnessPal). Use this number as a starting point. Then, subtract 500 from this number to get an average calorie target that will result in weight loss.;
, Both processed foods and those that are fried are generally higher in calories. When you eat these types of foods regularly it will be hard to lose weight and get rid of love handles.


Processed foods and fried foods are known to be high-calorie. In addition, these foods may also be high in added sugars, harmful types of fat and a lot of additives or preservatives.Foods to limit include: sweetened beverages, fried foods, fast foods, chips, crackers, ice cream, candy, processed meats, frozen TV dinners, canned meals, cookies, cakes and breakfast pastries.
If possible, do not eat many foods with high amounts of added sugars. Many studies show that foods high in sugar are typically stored around the stomach area and can worsen the looks of love handles., Many studies show that men who consume a higher amount of carbohydrates have an increased amount of fat around their stomach. Reduce carbohydrate-rich foods to minimize this and reduce love handles.


Carbohydrates are found in many types of foods. Examples of carbohydrate-rich foods include deserts like cake, cookies, pie as well as other grains like the bread you use to make a sandwich. Other foods contain small amounts of carbohydrate as well, including dairy products, legumes, starchy vegetables and fruit contain carbohydrates.
Men need at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Measure out appropriate portions of each — 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad or 1/2 cup of fruit.Try making half of your plate a non-starchy vegetable at each meal.
Stick to lower sugar fruits like berries. Also, stick to non-starchy vegetables and limit your intake of items like carrots, peas, potatoes and corn. These starchy vegetables are higher in carbohydrates.
Minimize your intake of grains as these are the most carbohydrate-dense foods. If you choose to eat them, go for 100% whole grains since these are high in fiber and protein., Protein consumption is essential for men when they're working out and following a reduced-calorie diet, but that doesn't mean just any protein will do. Leaner protein can help reduce love handles.Fatty cuts of meat like sausage, bacon, full fat dairy and 80/20 beef are high in saturated fat. High levels of saturated fat have been associated with increased stomach fat in men. Reduce your consumption of these foods and switch to leaner cuts of protein.Choose chicken, fish, turkey and leaner cuts of red meats. In addition, try to eat items like salmon, tuna, nuts and nut butters as these are high in protein and are considered ""healthy fats,"" which have been shown to reduce belly fat and love handles., Although water doesn't necessarily decrease your love handles, it can help men lose body weight and reduce love handles in the long-term.


Typical recommendations for water intake range from eight to 13 8-oz glasses (2 to 3 liters) daily for men. You may need more based on your activity level.In addition, drinking adequate amounts of fluid can help decrease your appetite throughout the day. Plus if you drink a glass before a meal, it can help decrease how much you eat and stick to your calorie limit.

, Cardio is essential for men to reduce body fat, especially around the stomach area and love handles. Incorporate regular aerobic exercise to help get rid of your love handles.Men should include 30 to 40 minutes of moderate to intense cardio exercise four to five days per week.
Try any moderate intensity activity like: jogging/running, using the elliptical machine, swimming, doing aerobics classes and cycling.

, Research suggests that alternating between periods of hard exertion and medium to light exertion burns more calories and fat than maintaining a constant pace.Join a cardio burn or boot camp class at your local gym. These classes use various equipment to do interval training. It is aimed at developing muscles and reducing body fat.
Do a flow yoga class. These classes combine extremely hard poses with rest periods.
Join a running group. Look for a group that does sprints and jogging. You can also time yourself to run for two minutes and walk fast or jog for two minutes. Do 30 second sprints every five minutes.

, Many studies show that lifestyle activities can offer men the same health and weight loss benefits as more structured and planned exercise.Increase your lifestyle activity to help get rid of your love handles.


Lifestyle activities can include things like doing household chores, walking during the day, standing and taking the stairs.
Think about your typical day and brainstorm some ideas of how you can be more active. Take more steps or move more throughout your typical day.
You may also want to consider purchasing a pedometer or using a pedometer app on your phone. This can help you see how active you are and encourage you to take more steps.

, Crunches are a classic abdominal exercise that can help tone and slim your waistline. This particular exercise will work the front of your stomach muscles.Remember that core exercises will not reduce your body fat or your love handles — you need to reduce your overall body fat with diet and cardio for that. Strength exercises like crunches will develop your core muscles, but no one will be able to see them if there is still a layer of fat over the muscle.


Lay on your back with your knees bent. Stack one hand on top of the other on the back of your neck. Keep your elbows wide.
Lift your shoulders a few inches off the ground, until you feel your deep stomach muscles engage. Raise up 1 more inch, so you lift your upper back off the ground.
Slowly lower your upper back down to the floor. Repeat this crunch in three sets of 10 to 100. Once you feel you are ready for the advanced version, raise your legs so that they are straight in the air or bent in a tabletop.

, This version of the crunch will work into the sides of your stomach and hips.Return to the original crunch position. Lift your legs so that they are in a tabletop position. Your knees are bent and your shins are parallel to the ground.
Raise your chest until your shoulders are off the mat. Twist toward your right leg. Simultaneously extend your left leg out so that it is straight out and parallel to the floor.
Reach your right leg out and bring your left leg in as you crunch toward your left to meet it. You will not be able to touch your arms to your inward knee. Keep your elbows wide, so that the effort remains in your abdomen, not your neck. Do two to three sets of 10 to 20.

, Similar to a regular crunch, this exercise also works the front of the abs, especially the lower abdominal muscles.Raise your legs in the air so they are straight above your hips. Keep a slight bend in the knees. Flex your deep abdominal muscles inward.
Move your legs toward your elbows. Slowly return to a straight position. This will work your lower abdominal muscles. Do two to three sets of 10.

, This is a great exercise as it works every muscle in your core.Turn over on your hands and knees. Place your forearms on your mat in a bend, 90 degree angle position. Grasp one fist with the other hand.
Reach one leg straight behind you. Pull in and tighten your abs as you do this. Reach the second leg out, and adjust so that your body forms a perfect straight plank. Hold for 30 seconds to two minutes while breathing steadily.
Do the same exercise on your hands (in push-up position), instead of your elbows. Make sure your arms are right below your shoulders when you get into position. If you have a hard time doing this exercise in the beginning, do it against a kitchen counter at a 45 degree angle.

, Similar to a traditional plank, this is an essential exercise that specifically works your obliques.


Lay on your right side on your mat. Place your elbow directly below your shoulder. Reach your feet out so your body is in a straight line on its side.
Raise your hips up, resting your body weight on your right foot and right shoulder. If this is too difficult, bend your left leg and place your shin on the ground in front of your right knee to absorb some weight.
Raise your left hand straight into the air so it's perpendicular to the floor. Hold this position for 15 to 60 seconds. Repeat at least two times on each side.

, This will exercise your lower back and obliques.


Lay on your stomach with your arms reaching forward at shoulder-width. Place the tops of your feet down on the mat at hip-width.
Flex your stomach muscles. Raise your right arm and left foot at the same time. Keep them in the air for three seconds.
Lower your right arm and left foot and raise the left arm and right foot. Repeat 10 times on each side for three to six counts each.
For an extra workout, alternate the arms and legs quickly 20 times on each side, after doing the slow movements.

Be aware that existing medical conditions can be risk factors for yeast infections.",How to Diagnose a Yeast Infection at Home," Yeast infections can be found in areas such as the groin area, the folds of the buttocks, between the breasts, in your mouth and digestive tract, near the toes and fingers, and in the navel. In general, yeast thrives in places that are moister and have more nooks and crannies than other parts of the body.The red spots may become raised and begin to look like small, red pimples. Try to avoid scratching at these bumps; if you scratch them and they pop, the infection could spread to other parts of your body.
Note that babies commonly get yeast infections, which cause diaper rashes that bring about the redness and small bumps described above. This often appears in the skin creases, thighs and genital area and is caused most often by the moisture that's trapped in a dirty diaper when left on for too long.;
, The skin and area of your body that is affected by the yeast infection will feel itchy and hypersensitive to touch. It may also become irritated by clothes or foreign objects rubbing against the infected spot.The infection might also cause you to feel a burning sensation in and around the area that is infected.

, There are three main kinds of yeast infections: vaginal infections, skin infections, and throat infections. Each type of infection has its own specific symptoms in addition to the symptoms listed above.Vaginal yeast infection: If you have a vaginal yeast infection, which is generally what people refer to when they say they have a yeast infection, you may notice that your vagina and vulva have become red, swollen, itchy and irritated. You may feel a burning or painful sensation when you urinate or have sex. Vaginal yeast infections are also often, but not always, accompanied by a thick (like cottage cheese), white, odorless discharge in the vagina. Note that 75% of women will get a vaginal yeast infection at some point in their lives.Skin infection: If you have a skin infection on your hands or feet, you may notice a rashes, patches, and blisters between the toes or fingers. You may also notice white spots beginning to form on the nails of the affected appendages.Oral Thrush: Yeast infections in the throat are also referred to as oral thrush. You will notice that your throat has become red and there may be white blister-like bumps or patches forming on the back of your mouth near your throat and on the tongue. You may also notice cracks at the corners of your mouth (angular cheilitis) and have some difficulty swallowing., If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed above for any of the potential types of yeast infection, you should see your doctor immediately for a firm diagnosis. This is particularly important if this is your first vaginal yeast infection.It's important to get the diagnosis confirmed since there are different types of vaginal infections that are often misdiagnosed by women as yeast infections. Indeed, research has shown that only 35% of women were able to correctly diagnose a yeast infection from their symptoms alone.


Once you've experienced a vaginal yeast infection and had it diagnosed by a physician, you can self-diagnose such infections in the future and cure them with over-the-counter treatments.Be aware that recurrent yeast infections can be a sign of a more serious underlying disorder, such as diabetes, cancer or HIV-AIDs.You should also call your physician if your symptoms don’t improve after three days, if you have a fever or any of the symptoms change (e.g., vaginal discharge increases or changes color, new rashes appear on your body, etc.)., If you suspect you may have a vaginal yeast infection, the most common type of yeast infection, and you have had one in the past, then you can take a pH test and self-diagnose at home. Normal vaginal pH is around 4, which is slightly acidic. Follow any instructions accompanying the test.To do the test, hold a piece of pH paper against the wall of your vagina for a few seconds. Compare the color of the paper to the chart provided with the test. The number on the chart for the color that best approximates the color of the paper is your vaginal pH number.
If the result is above 4, see your doctor. This is not indicative of a yeast infection, but could be a sign of another infection.
If the test result is below 4, it is probably a yeast infection.

, If a yeast infection is allowed to grow unchecked, it can develop a ring-like shape that can appear red or have no noticeable discoloration. This can occur in both vaginal and skin infections.This ring can actually cause hair loss, if the affected area is a hairy part of the body (such as a man’s beard, a scalp, or a groin area).

, Skin infections can spread to your nail beds if left unchecked. If the yeast infection on your skin affects the fingernails, it will begin to appear as a red, swollen and painful area around the fingernail. Eventually, your fingernail and nail may separate, revealing a discolored white or light yellow nail bed., Certain risk groups have an increased likelihood of having more complicated yeast infections, including:People who have had four or more yeast infections in a year
Pregnant women
People with uncontrolled diabetes
People with weakened immunity systems (due to medications or conditions such as HIV)

, Typically, most yeast infections result from the candida fungus Candida albicans. However, sometimes a different candida fungus may be responsible for the infection. This complicates the situation since most over-the-counter and prescribed treatments are designed to treat Candida albicans infections. As a result, non-Candida albicans infections generally require more aggressive treatments.Note that the only way to diagnose a different type of candida fungus is for your doctor to take a sample (a swab) and test it in order to identify the non-candida organism., Prolonged periods of antibiotic treatment not only kill the bacterial pathogen inside the body but can also kill the “good bacteria” in the body. This may cause an imbalance in the flora of the mouth, skin, and the vagina, which may cause the overgrowth of yeast.If you have been taking antibiotics recently and are experiencing burning and itching sensations, you might have a yeast infection.

, Pregnancy increases the sugar in vaginal secretions (brought about by estrogen and progesterone) which the yeast can thrive in. When yeast thrive, it causes an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora, which in turn causes a yeast infection., Illness, obesity, poor sleeping habits, and stress can increase the likelihood of developing a yeast infection.Obesity in particular is a potential risk factor since obese people have larger skin folds which are warmer and more moist than average-sized skin folds. These large skin folds make an ideal condition for yeast to thrive.
Obesity is also linked to the development of diabetes, which makes women doubly as likely to develop a yeast infection.

, Birth control pills and one-time ""morning after"" pills cause a change in hormone - mainly estrogen - levels, which in turn can bring about a yeast infection.The higher the dosage of estrogen in the contraceptive, the increased likelihood of yeast growth., A woman is most likely to develop a yeast infection around the time of her period. During menstruation, estrogen deposits glycogen (a type of sugar present inside cells) in the lining of the vagina. When progesterone surges, the cells shed in the vagina making sugar available for the yeast to multiply and grow.

, Douches are mostly used to clean the vagina after a period, but this practice is generally unnecessary and can even be harmful. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, douching when done regularly can change the balance of the vaginal flora and the acidity of the vagina, thus disturbing the balance of good and bad bacteria. The level of bacteria helps maintain the acidic environment and its destruction can cause the overgrowth of the bad bacteria, which in turn causes yeast infections., Certain diseases or conditions correlate with yeast infections.


For example, having a suppressed immune system, due to HIV or a recent organ transplant, can cause yeast infections.Thyroid or endocrine disorders as well as uncontrolled diabetes also create an environment in your body that favors candidal growth."

Drink more water.Many people do not consume the daily recommended water intake each day.,
Drink smaller amounts more frequently.,
Compensate for fluid loss after working out.,
Monitor how much time you are spending in the sun.,
Avoid sodas, caffeinated beverages, and/or alcohol for hydration purposes.,
Check your urine as a sign of your hydration status.Dark-colored urine (a dark yellow), particularly if accompanied by infrequent urination, is a sign of dehydration.",How to Get Hydrated1," Anywhere between eight to 15 cups of water per day is recommended, depending upon your activity level and other factors such as your body weight and exposure to the sun or warm temperatures. Aim to consume at least eight cups of water each day Unless otherwise advised by a medical professional.;
, If drinking enough water is a challenge for you, spreading it out throughout the day can make it easier for your system to handle. Carry a water bottle with you during your work day, or have a glass of water beside you when you are relaxing at home. If you keep it in close proximity, you will be more likely to sip on it throughout the day. Before you know it, you will be on your way to reaching your hydration goals.


Note that even when you don't feel thirsty, it is important to keep your fluids up.
Also, just because it is cold does not mean that you don't need additional fluids — exertion, fierce weather, dryness, etc., can all contribute to becoming dehydrated.
If you experience thirst that is unsatisfied by drinking fluids, this may indicate an underlying condition, such as diabetes, or you may be experiencing thirst as a side effect of medication. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing these issues.

, Many people underestimate the amount of fluid lost in sweat when they go to the gym or do another form of exercise. It is recommended to drink one to three cups of water prior to beginning your exercise routine, and to carry a water bottle with you as you work out. You can substitute water with a sports drink to replenish your electrolytes (which include salt) as well, as you also lose salt when you sweat (and many sports drinks contain calories that will fuel you to perform better during a tough workout).


For endurance sports, an electrolyte beverage is key as salt is vital to your body's ability to absorb water.For shorter workouts, regular water should suffice.

, The more time you spend in hot weather, the greater your body's need for fluid replenishment will be.To stay hydrated in the hot weather, carry fluids with you. If at all possible, schedule your outdoor activities for the early mornings or the late afternoons when the sun is less strong, as this will decrease your rate of dehydration.


If you work out outdoors and also live in a place with a hot climate, you may choose to do workouts at times of the day when it is cooler out. This will make it easier for you to maintain adequate hydration without having to consume huge volumes of fluid.

, Often when people are sick, they turn to sodas such as ginger ale to settle their stomach. These, however, are an ineffective choice if you are trying to combat dehydration. This is because they contain too much sugar and too little sodium to replenish electrolytes.Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increases fluid loss from the body — you may urinate more fluids than you actually drink. The headache you feel when you're hungover is a direct result of dehydration. If you're drying to hydrate, avoid alcohol.Caffeinated beverages have a mild diuretic property. While this should not cause dehydration, if you are trying to hydrate your body, caffeinated beverages are not the most effective choice. Stick with straight water instead., On the other hand, frequent light-colored urine is a sign that your body is well-hydrated. Don't be afraid to check in the toilet as it is actually one of the more effective ways to evaluate your body's hydration status.

Wash your hands often.,
Stay away from public places.,
Wear shoes wherever you go.,
Tell your supervisor if you have a fungal infection.,
Use your own personal items.,
Cover up any existing fungal infections.",How to Prevent the Spread of Fungal Infections1," Frequent hand washing is one of the best ways to stop the spread of fungal infections.Make sure that you wash your hands any time that you may have touched your own fungal infection or after touching objects and surfaces that may be infected. For example, if you use equipment at the gym, then wash your hands right after you finish.;
, If you have a fungal infection, then you should stay away from places where you may be more likely to spread the infection. For example, you may be more likely to spread a fungal infection if you visit the gym or go swimming in a public pool. Fungal infections of any kind are spread through contact. If you currently have a fungal infection, avoid going to any public place that might make it possible for your infection to spread to others.Do not visit any gyms, public pools, or public bathing areas until your infection is cured.

, You can pick up a fungal infection by walking around barefoot, so wearing shoes is a good way to protect yourself. If you have a fungal infection on your feet, then walking around barefoot will also increase the chance that you will spread it.


Make sure that you are always wearing some kind of footwear when you are out in public, especially in places like locker rooms where more people tend to go barefoot., Some jobs require a lot of physical contact with people, which may put others at risk if you have a fungal infection. If your job requires a lot of direct contact with others, such as a nursing position, then you should tell your supervisor if you have a fungal infection., Don't share any personal items with others, whether you have a fungal infection or not. Since fungal infections spread through contact, sharing personal items with another person increases the risk of spreading the fungal spores. Although it may seem kind to share something with someone, avoid doing so to decrease your risk of spreading or contracting a fungal infection.Do not share any personal items such as clothing, towels, shoes, socks, makeup, deodorant, or anything else that you use or wear on your body.

, If you currently have a fungal infection, you should cover it up before going out to a public place. Touching the infected area to another person or object by accident can cause the fungal infection to spread. Keep the area covered when you are in public until it has been treated.You won't need to keep your children home from school if they have a fungal infection. However, you will have to cover the area and inform the school.
Don't cover the area too tightly. It is important to keep the area cool and dry as you treat the fungal infection.

Recognize signs of severe dehydration.,
Get IV fluids.,
Get a diagnosis for the underlying cause of your dehydration.",How to Get Hydrated2," If you are experiencing lightheadedness, dizziness, confusion, or altered vital signs (such as a fast heart rate and an increased respiratory rate), you may have a more severe form of dehydration that warrants professional medical attention. The most common causes of severe dehydration are heat stroke (from spending too much time in the sun), extreme endurance sports, and illnesses that involve diarrhea and/or vomiting.


If you believe you may have any of these medical conditions, or if you are worried that you may have severe dehydration, it is best to see a doctor sooner rather than later for treatment., IV (intravenous) fluids are the fastest and most efficient way to replace fluids if you are suffering from severe dehydration. This is because the fluid is injected straight into your vein, rather than having to go the long route of being absorbed by your digestive system. IV fluids are also tailored to your specific needs with the perfect balance of fluid, salt, and calories to optimize your body's hydration and overall health.If you have an illness such as diarrhea and/or vomiting, you may not be able to consume fluids orally (due to nausea and/or vomiting, or diarrhea which prevents absorption); therefore, IV fluids may be your only option in severe cases.

, It is important to understand that severe cases of dehydration require not only fluids for treatment, but also diagnosing and resolving the underlying cause of the dehydration — a job best accomplished by an experienced physician. If you try to rehydrate yourself without first identifying the cause of the problem, it is unlikely to lead to a long-term or permanent solution; therefore, if in doubt it is best to see a doctor who can guide you through the steps to getting properly hydrated and in good health once again.The specific diagnosis underlying dehydration also affects the treatment course, in many cases. This is another reason why identifying the underlying cause is key.
If you suffer from a chronic disease such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, an endocrine disorder, or hyponatremia it can be dangerous for you to make changes to your daily fluid intake. Speak with your physician about what is appropriate for you, and keep in mind that the recommendations for the general population will not necessarily apply.

Practice good hygiene.,
Take good care of your feet.,
Care for your nails.,
Cut back on the use of nail polish.",How to Prevent the Spread of Fungal Infections3," Reputable salons use good sanitation practices to protect their clients and employees from skin infections, but it is still possible to get an infection from a reputable salon. There are some things you should keep in mind whenever you go for a manicure or pedicure.


Make sure that any salon that you visit is licensed by the state health department.
Ask how the nail tools are sanitized between uses. The tools should be heat-sanitized with an autoclave to kill all of the germs and bacteria. Other methods are not as effective.
Never get a manicure or pedicure if you know that you have nail fungus. You may spread it to the nail technician.

Keep your nails trimmed short and keep them dry.Wash your hands and feet regularly.
If you have nail fungus, avoid touching anything after touching your nails, as this can spread the fungus.

, Feet are often subjected to conditions that carry a higher risk of contracting nail fungus. Shoes and socks create warm and moist environments, which is what nail fungus needs to grow. Take some of the following steps to prevent toenail fungus.Wear shoes that allow for airflow.
Don't wear socks that cause your feet to sweat. Look for bamboo or polypropylene socks and avoid cotton.

Use protection during oral sex.,
Wear natural, loose-fitting underwear and pants.,
Change out of wet panties and pants.,
Wipe from front to back.,
Manage stress.",How to Prevent the Spread of Fungal Infections4," Although vaginal intercourse does not seem to spread yeast infections from one partner to another, oral sex can lead to a yeast infection. Women may develop yeast infections after receiving oral sex due to the yeast in saliva.To reduce this risk, use plastic wrap or a dental dam during oral sex., Tight fitting, synthetic fiber underwear and pants can increase your chances of getting a yeast infection. To reduce this risk, wear only loose-fitting, natural fiber underwear and pants.For example, choose a comfortable-fitting pair of cotton underwear over a tight pair of synthetic material panties.


It is important to wash underwear in warm water and soap — cold water washing in the sink does not remove or diminish yeast

Your hair may fall out easily.
On some people, the scalp may become inflamed, seep pus, and form yellow crusts.People with this complication may also have a fever or enlarged lymph nodes.;
, It is important to realize that the antifungal shampoo alone is unlikely to cure you. You still need to get anti-fungal medications from the doctor. But the shampoo can reduce the spread of the fungus, helping you to heal faster. Depending on the type and strength of the shampoo, it maybe available over-the-counter or by prescription only.Commonly used shampoos contain selenium sulphide or ketoconazole.
Use the shampoo twice a week during the first few weeks of treatment, unless instructed otherwise by your doctor or the manufacturer’s instructions on the packaging.
Consult your doctor before applying these shampoos to a child or using them yourself if you are pregnant.

, You can get these with a prescription from your doctor. Do not use them on a child or if you are pregnant without discussing it first with your doctor. These prescription medications will kill the fungus, but have side effects that need to be considered:Terbafine (Lamisil) — This medication is generally taken as a daily pill for about four weeks and usually works. Side effects are usually short, but may include nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, a rash, or an altered sense of taste. Contact your doctor if you experience side effects. If you have liver disease or lupus, you will probably not be able to take this medication.

Griseofulvin (Grifulvin V, Gris-Peg) — This is a spray that is taken each day for up to 10 weeks. The spray is not available in the U.S. but can easily be obtained in the U.K. It can cause side effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and an upset stomach. Both women and men need to be aware that it can cause birth defects in unborn children if the mother takes it while pregnant, if the mother takes it shortly before conceiving, or if the father has taken it within six months of fathering the child. Griseofulvin may reduce the effectiveness of progestogen-only and combined contraceptive pills. People on it should use a barrier method of contraception like a condom. Women who are breastfeeding and people with liver disease or lupus also should not take this medication. Do not drive and be aware that you will be more sensitive to alcohol while taking it.

Itraconazole — This medication is taken as pill for approximately one to two weeks. It may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and an upset stomach. Children, elderly people, and people with liver disease should not take this medication.

, If you have animals with patchy fur, they may be the source of your infection. You can get it from them by petting, handling, or grooming them, so always wash your hands afterwards. Common sources of animal-to-human transmission are:Dogs
Cats
Horses
Cows
Goats
Pigs

, The fungus can be spread through skin-to-skin contact. People at a particularly high risk include:People who have a ringworm infection elsewhere on their body, such as athlete’s foot or jock itch. If you scratch the infection and then scratch your head, you can transfer the fungus to your scalp.
Hairdressers, barbers, and hair stylists, because they come in contact with the hair of lots of people
School nurses and daycare workers who are in contact with lots of children
People who have a family member or a sexual partner who is infected

, Objects that may be carrying the fungus should be disinfected or replaced. The following objects can easily transfer the fungus:Hairbrushes, combs, or hair implements. Soak them for an hour in a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts water.
Towels, bed sheets, gym or wrestling mats, and clothing. Add a disinfectant or bleach to the wash when you wash them.

Snack on raw fruits and veggies.",How to Minimize Your Risk of Stroke with Diet1," The best way to start eating a more healthy diet is by eating more fruits and veggies. Not only will you wind up consuming less of the fats, salt, and sugar that put you at risk of stroke and other diseases, you’ll also be getting more of the nutrients that help keep you healthy.A serving of veggies is a cup of raw, leafy vegetables or 1/2 a cup of other chopped vegetables.A medium-sized fruit (comparable in size to a baseball), or a 1/2 cup of chopped, cooked, or canned fruit counts as one serving.
If you drink juice, only count it as one portion of your five. Opt for unsweetened fruit juice or vegetable juice.;
, If you tend to eat cereal for breakfast, choose one with whole grain listed as its first ingredient. Eat it with a handful of berries and either Greek yogurt or a milk derived from a nut. If you tend to eat eggs for breakfast, make a scramble that has as much (or more) veggies as it does eggs. Mushrooms and tomatoes are great options.Smoothies are also healthy breakfast options. Try an almond milk base with a banana and peanut butter, or pineapple juice with greens and chia seeds.

, The first thing your medical provider may do if they suspect that you have valley fever is to give you a chest x-ray. This will determine if there are any problems with the lining of the lungs, which may happen due to valley fever.Valley fever can lead to more severe respiratory issues like pneumonia. A chest x-ray will check for any pneumonia symptoms or other lung issues.
Residual nodules may be present on future chest x-rays. However, these are not cancerous. , Since valley fever is difficult to diagnose, chest x-rays or a physical exam aren’t enough for a positive diagnosis. To get a diagnosis, the lab will need to positively identify the fungus in your body. This can be done through a culture,


A smear or culture is taken when you cough. The lab will test the substance you cough up for evidence of the fungus.

, An antibody test is another way your health care provider can diagnose valley fever. An antibody test looks at the immune systems for antibodies for the fungus. If you have valley fever, your body will have produced the antibodies to fight it off, so they will be present in your body.An antibody test can be done via a blood test or a spinal tap.
Be aware that a blood test can give a false negative. If you have a negative test, consider getting another one done to confirm it.

, If you have a positive diagnosis for valley fever, your medical provider will discuss treatment options with you. You may not need any treatment except rest and fluids if your symptoms are mild. If you have more severe symptoms, the medical professional will give you antifungal medications.Antifungal medications don’t always kill the fungus. This means you may have a relapse if your immune system is weakened.
Often, having valley fever once gives you an immunity to it for life.

"
Be aware that the symptoms are nonspecific.,
Identify who is at risk.,
Keep in mind that complications can be severe.,
Know where valley fever is found.",How to Diagnose Valley Fever3," Symptoms of valley fever may be mild or severe. They also are symptoms of other conditions, such as a cold, flu, or other common conditions. This means that you won’t be able to notice symptoms and suspect that you have valley fever.


A medical professional will have to do diagnostic tests to check for valley fever and rule out other conditions.

, People who live in the areas where the valley fever fungus grows are at risk. People who visit in these areas may also get it, as well as people in the military who train in these desert areas. Partaking in recreational activities in the desert, like biking or driving ATVs, may increase your risk.


Certain occupations may be at a higher risk. For example, those who do agricultural work, digging or excavation, or any other job where they are digging or disturbing the soil are at a higher risk.
Earthquakes in these areas may increase the risk of valley fever.
Animals can also get valley fever. Dogs are extremely vulnerable to valley fever, but horses, cattle, sheep, and other animals may get it, too.

, If someone has a severe case of valley fever, this it can cause some severe complications which may have lifelong effects. Some possible complications of valley fever include:Pneumonia. It is possible to develop a severe form of pneumonia as a result of valley fever.

Ruptured lung nodules. In some cases, nodules or small cavities will form in the lungs. These may rupture, make breathing difficult, and cause chest pain. They may require surgical removal or the placement of a tube.

Spreading or dissemination throughout the body. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body which can cause serious damage, such as bone lesions, skin ulcers, heart inflammation, and meningitis.

, Valley fever is also called desert rheumatism since it is contracted in desert areas. Cases of desert fever have been found throughout the southwestern United States, including Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Texas. The fungus can also be found in Northern Mexico and desert areas in Central and South America.The central valleys of California are particularly vulnerable. There have also been a lot of cases around Phoenix, Tucson, and El Paso. In Mexico, is mostly found in Sonora and Chihuahua.

Treat the flu-like symptoms.,
Eat an antifungal diet.,
Take supplements.,
Use caution with natural remedies.",How to Treat Valley Fever2," A common way to treat valley fever is to treat the flu-like symptoms. The main treatment is to get plenty of rest. Many cases of valley fever are mild. It may present like a minor cold or mild flu, so taking it easy and resting may be all you need. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Valley fever often goes away on its own.Rest helps your body fight off the infection. You can stay at home to allow your body time to recover.
Valley fever is not contagious, so you don’t have to worry about spreading it to others at work or school.

, A diet that helps create an environment where fungi won’t grow may help kill the valley fever fungus. You should significantly reduce your intake of dairy, sugars, beer, and foods that contain yeast. These foods encourage fungus to grow and thrive inside the body.Try not to eat milk, cheese, or yogurt while you are trying to treat valley fever. Eliminate sugars, including those coming from honey, fruit, or fruit juice.
Restrict intake of beer and other foods or drinks containing yeast.
Focus on eating foods that are unprocessed or uncooked during the treatment period.

, Another way you may be able to naturally kill the fungus is through supplements. You can try taking vitamin C, E, B complex, and A-plus to help promote an environment inside your body where fungi won’t thrive. Turmeric is a common antifungal that can be taken to help kill the fungus. Garlic is an antifungal herb that can be eaten or taken as a supplement that may help kill the fungus.Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium supplements may help restore a health normal flora within the gut.
You may also want to try aloe vera, basil, cinnamon, cloves, magnesium, manganese, oregano, thyme, wheat germ, or zinc. They all have antifungal properties that may help.

, Always use caution when using natural remedies to treat valley fever. You should talk to your doctor or a naturopathy doctor before choosing to use a natural remedy over a medical one. Valley fever is usually mild and may respond well to natural treatments, but certain people are at a higher risk for severe symptoms or cases of valley fever.If you have a severe case of valley fever or have a compromised immune system, always see your doctor.

Identify the symptoms.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Identify where valley fever most often occurs.,
Recognize those at high risk for a severe case of valley fever.",How to Treat Valley Fever3," If you have valley fever, you may develop flu-like symptoms. Common symptoms include a fever, chills, shortness of breath, and night sweats. You may have a dry cough or a cough that produces blood. You might develop headaches and feel fatigued.Your joints or bones may start to ache, like you have arthritis.
A rash may also appear with valley fever. The rash includes red painful bumps on the lower part of your legs. The rash may also appear on the chest, arms, or back. The bumps might turn from red to a brown color. Bumps may also have heads like pimples or form blisters.
Many times, valley fever presents no symptoms., To get a diagnosis, you should visit your doctor. The symptoms are nonspecific, which means it’s difficult to figure out that you valley fever just from the symptoms. The doctor will run various tests to positively identify the presence of the valley fever fungus in your body.The doctor will either do a smear culture or a blood test. These will show that the valley fever fungus is in your body.

, Valley fever can be contracted in arid desert locations in North and South America. This includes the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. People who live in these areas are at risk of contracting the fungus. People who visit may also get it, too.Jobs that disturb the earth or have a person digging in the soil exponentially increase the risk of contracting the disease.
Recreational activities where you disturb the soil or inhale dust from the soil, such as biking or riding ATVs, may increase your risk.

, Valley fever is pretty mild in most cases. However, some people have a higher risk of the fungus turning into a worse condition or even becoming deadly. Those who are at a higher risk include those with weakened immune systems or who are already ill.


This includes those who are HIV positive, pregnant women, diabetics, and people who take medications that make the immune system weaker.
Certain ethnicities are at a higher risk: Filipinos, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans.

Get more healthy protein.,
Make sure you’re getting adequate fiber.,
Meet your daily magnesium requirements.",How to Minimize Your Risk of Stroke with Diet2," In addition to copious amounts of fruits and veggies, you should also eat plenty of protein everyday. While specific daily requirements vary based on gender, age, and weight, it will likely be advantageous to increase your current protein intake, as long as it comes from healthy sources. In fact, replacing red meat with fish is a great way to keep protein consumption up, reduce the risk of stroke, and get healthy nutrients.Shoot for at least two portions of fish per week, ideally mackerel, sardines, trout, or salmon.
Consistency is especially important with protein intake. If you don't eat much meat, make sure you're eating plenty of nuts, beans, and/or Greek Yogurt on days you don't eat fish. Other healthy sources of protein include tempeh, tofu, and textured veggie protein, and more.
The saturated fats in red meat can raise your cholesterol, increasing your risk of heart complications such as stroke. Limit red meat consumption to once or twice per week at most, and choose lean cuts. If you’re making a stew or other type of mixed entree, use more beans and lentils than meat.

, A high-fiber diet will help reduce the cholesterol levels in your blood. You’ll get a good amount of fiber from vegetables, but you should also eat some whole grain every day. Examples include cereals and breads with whole grains listed as the primary ingredient, brown rice, and whole grain couscous.An especially heart-healthy dish is an whole grain and veggie medley, such as whole grain quinoa with broccoli and kale.
Oatmeal Oatmeal is one of the best foods for lowering bad cholesterol., Increasing your magnesium intake is likely to immediately reduce your risk of having a stroke. Adult females need 320mg per day, while males need 420mg. Most people do not meet these recommended values.Supplements don’t work as well, so get your magnesium from food. Fortunately, those foods high in magnesium are generally very healthy for you.
Fish is the ideal source, especially salmon and trout. Dark, leafy greens, colorful veggies, nuts, seeds, and whole grains provide magnesium as well. Try mixing these sources, especially flaxseed, into any of the dishes you regularly cook.

"
"
Consume less sodium.,
Reduce unhealthy fat and sugar consumption.,
Steam, boil, and grill your food.,
Drink alcohol in moderation only.",How to Minimize Your Risk of Stroke with Diet3," Eating too much sodium puts many people at greater risk of heart disease and stroke. Since sodium is a component of salt, it is highly prevalent in many people’s food supplies. Make a point of monitoring your sodium consumption and making sure you’re not eating more than 2,300mg per day. If you are of African descent, limit your intake to no more than 1,500mg per day.People of African descent are relatively likely to develop high blood pressure, a condition that can can lead to stroke, and can be worsened by high sodium consumption.If you eat a lot of packaged foods, monitoring your sodium intake is especially important. Large amounts of sodium are often present in standard portions of canned food and packaged breads, for instance. On the other hand, if you use salt to season your food, make sure you’re using less than a teaspoon of salt per day.
As alternative seasoning options, try using fresh ginger, lemon juice, and dried herbs or peppers instead of salt. Checked mixed spices to make sure they aren’t mostly salt.If you are over 51 years of age, or have diabetes, kidney disease, or another chronic condition, keep sodium consumption under 1,500mg per day.

, If you eat meat and cheese, make a point of choosing healthier options. Avoid processed meats, which have high amounts of saturated and trans fats. Opt for lean cuts of meat and poultry without the skin attached, as well as low-fat or fat-free dairy products. Limit processed grains as well, by keeping pastry or biscuit consumption extremely rare.Check that fat content of packaged food. Avoid anything with hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, and choose options with the least saturated and trans fat. As ballpark figures, you should consume less than a dozen grams of saturated fat and less than two grams of trans fat per day.There is plenty of healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat in foods like fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. These are not a concern, and can help strengthen your heart.
Try to cut out soft drinks, fast food, and frozen meals entirely. These all often include excessive amounts of sugar and sodium, and provide little in the way of healthy nutritional value.

, One way to immediately improve your diet is by cooking more at home. This is in part because homemade meals will generally be less sugary, and you can control the amount of ingredients such as salt. Further, fried food often contains inordinate amounts of fat and should be eaten rarely, if at all.


Food fried in oil, butter, or ghee is especially risky for your heart. When you do occasionally need to fry a dish, use vegetable, nut, or olive-based oil.

, If you’re female, limit yourself to one alcoholic beverage per day. For males, two alcoholic beverages per day is still moderate. In this context, one beverage consists of 1.5 ounces of liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer.Interestingly, studies show there are beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption on lowering your risk of stroke.


Avoid binge drinking. You can’t have 10 drinks on Saturday, even if you didn’t drink all week. Keep the moderation guidelines even when you socialize.

Try using lower calorie dairy products.,
Swap nuts in for cream-based sauces.,
Skim off extra fat.,
Limit the salt content.,
Use natural ingredients to mimic flavors.,
Make healthier blue cheese dressing.,
Whip up a vegan Alfredo sauce.,
Make a lower calorie cheese sauce.,
Try Greek yogurt ranch dip.,
Try herbs and spices.,
Use produce that is in season.,
Try flavor-packed cooking methods.,
Use higher calorie sauces and dressings in moderation.",How to Make Healthier Sauces and Dressings," Many high-calorie and high-fat sauces and dressings are cream-based. Heavy cream, full-fat buttermilk, or sour cream can really hike up the calorie count on some of these smooth and creamy sauces.Many dressings and sauces get their delicious flavor from higher fat and higher calorie dairy food. The downside of this is that these ingredients come with a higher calorie count.
It can be difficult to replace dairy completely, so try using lower calorie dairy products to help cut down on your overall fat and calorie consumption.
For example, you can use fat-free sour cream to make dressings or use low-fat buttermilk to make ranch dressing.;
, You may be surprised that traditionally higher calorie dairy sauces and dressings can also be made from nuts.This is a great method to improving the overall nutrition on some of your favorite sauces.


Nuts are a great way to improve some of those higher calorie sauces. Nuts are high in protein, healthy fats and minerals.
Although nuts are high in calories, they are also high in protein, healthy fats, and minerals, which traditional cream-based sauces lack.
Nuts also contain a good amount of fat, but the type of fat found in nuts is a type of heart healthy fat known as omega-3s. This type of fat has been shown to be beneficial to your cardiovascular system.To use nuts as the base of creamy sauces, you'll need to soak them in hot water to help soften them. Then, blend or puree them with your favorite spices or seasonings.

, Another way to save some extra calories and fat is by removing the actual fat from sauces and seasonings.


Some sauces, like meat sauce, can be high in fat since there's no chance for the fat from the meat to be removed or strained.
For example, if you're making bolognese sauce, after browning the meat, drain off the extra fat. Or, let the sauce cool in the refrigerator which helps the fat solidify and then you can skim it off from the top.

, Fat and overall calories are not the only problem with many sauces and dressings. The salt or sodium content can also be a problem.


If you have an excessive salt or sodium intake, this could increase your risk of high blood pressure, which increases your risk of stroke.
When making your own homemade sauces, start by limiting how much salt you actually add to your sauce or dressing. Also, always measure the portion size of your salt.Also consider using other ingredients to give your sauce or dressing that pop of flavor typically associated with salt. For example, use vinegar, a spicy pepper or lemon juice. Garlic, ginger, dried herbs, and other spices can also add flavor.

, If you're looking to sweeten a sauce or add in more flavor, try using natural ingredients like fruits and vegetables. These can add a lot of flavor without a lot of added calories or fat.


Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories, but high in vitamins in fiber. In addition, they have a lot of great flavor that can be utilized in sauces and dressings.
For example, if you want to make a sweet sauce or add a touch of sweetness, try pureeing fruit.
You can also blend in roasted vegetables, like roasted red peppers, to add a little bit of smoky sweetness or dressings and sauces as well.

, Enjoy this creamy classic dressing, but with a lot fewer calories. Greek yogurt helps keep the creaminess without the added fat.In a small bowl mash up about 1/2 cup of crumbled blue cheese and 6 oz of plain fat-free greek yogurt. The blue cheese doesn't have to be completely smooth — it can be as chunky or smooth as you'd like.
Add 1 tablespoon each of mayonnaise, lemon juice and white wine vinegar to the blue cheese mixture. Also stir in a pinch of garlic powder.
Taste your dressing and add salt and pepper as needed. Chill for at least 30 minutes and serve over your favorite salad.

, If you love Alfredo sauce, you'll love this vegan nut-based Alfredo sauce. There's no dairy at all — just pureed nuts which lends a wonderful creamy texture.To start, soak a heaping 1/2 cup of raw cashews in water. Allow them to soak for at least eight hours if you can.
Add 1 teaspoon of garlic to a blender in addition to the soaked cashews. Add in about 3/4 cup of vegetable broth and puree until almost smooth.
Add in salt and pepper to taste plus 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast (or more or less according to your tastes).
Blend again until completely smooth. Taste and adjust for seasonings. Also, if the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth.
Serve over your favorite pasta with a little extra nutritional yeast and chopped basil.

, There's nothing that makes plain steamed broccoli or cauliflower a little tastier than adding a cheese sauce. Save on calories with this great recipe.In a small bowl, whisk together 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of flour with 1/4 cup of low-fat milk until smooth.
Add another 1 cup of milk and the flour mixture to a sauce pan and heat over medium high until it just begins to simmer.
Make sure to whisk the milk mixture constantly to prevent it from burning or getting clumpy. Cook until it gets thick, which will take about four minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in 2/3 cup of shredded cheddar, 1 teaspoon of dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and salt and pepper to taste.
Drizzle your cheese sauce over blanched vegetables or drizzled over homemade nachos.

, If you love raw vegetables and dip, try making your own homemade ranch dip at home. Again, Greek yogurt helps lower the calories on this tasty dip.Start by spooning about 1 cup of plain, non-fat Greek yogurt into a small bowl.
Then, mix in the following: 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml) of dried parsley, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, 2 teaspoons of onion powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried dill, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of dried chives and 1 teaspoon of salt.
Mix everything together until all the spices are mixed throughout the yogurt. Taste and adjust for seasonings.
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Serve with your favorite raw vegetables as the perfect snack.

, Although many foods do taste great with the addition of some sauces and dressings, there are ways to add flavor to foods that have little to no added calories.


Both herbs and spices (dried or fresh), can add a whole bunch of flavor to foods without any calories or fat.
Whether you add fresh herbs to a tomato-based pasta sauce or rub a steak with a flavorful spice blend, you can learn to enjoy foods with minimal added sauces or dressings.

, Some foods may taste a little bland if they're not in-season or fresh. This may be why you want to add a sauce or dressing to pump up their flavor. Try using in-season items to reduce the need to add additional flavorings.Each season there will be a variety of different fruits and vegetables that are in season. For example, strawberries and blackberries come into season during the summer. Kale and butternut squash are in season in the fall and winter.
When you're using fresh ingredients, they have more of a significant and bright flavor. You may not feel the need to add a high-calorie sauce or dressing to boost their flavor.

, Some cooking methods impart a ton of flavor to foods, while others leave them a little bland. Try using cooking techniques that can help increase the flavor of your foods.


Some cooking methods, like steaming, don't impart a lot of great flavor to foods. That's why drizzling cheese sauce over plain steamed broccoli is so appealing.
Steaming, sautéing, boiling or poaching don't always add a lot of flavor to foods. To help get you used to using less of those higher calorie sauces or dressings, skip these cooking methods and opt for something a little more flavorful.
Grilling is a great cooking method that's not only healthy, but imparts a huge amount of flavor to foods. When foods (like proteins, vegetables or even fruits) are grilled, they get a wonderful sear on the outside. This gives flavors a great smoky, charred flavor without any added dressings.Roasting is another great technique — especially for vegetables. Roasting uses the high temperature of the oven to slowly caramelize and brown the outside of foods. They become soft, nutty and sweet. No need for added dressings or sauces here either.

, Although there are a variety of lower calorie recipes and tricks to impart more flavors to foods, you can still occasionally use your favorite dressings or sauces.


Using a higher calorie or higher fat sauce on a regular basis is typically not recommended. Even in smaller quantities these can spike your overall calorie consumption.
If you use them in moderation and measure out the appropriate portion size, you can still include some of your favorite items. Try dipping foods in dressings/sauces instead of pouring them over your dish or mixing them in. People usually use less dressing when they dip.
Check on the nutrition label for the serving size. For dressings and sauces, it's usually about 1 – 2 tablespoons per serving. If you use more, you'll need to account for the extra calories and fat.
Also be mindful of those store-bought low-fat or fat-free items. Many times, the fat content is lower, but the sodium and/or sugar content is higher. Plus, the reduction in total calories usually isn't worth the extra additives.
The best is to make a healthier version at home to use the majority of the time and occasionally indulge in the ""real deal"" in moderation.

Identify alkaline-producing foods.,
Identify acidic foods.,
Identify neutral foods.",How to Mix Alkaline and Acidic Foods1," All vegetables are considered alkaline foods. Broccoli, cucumber, and string beans are a few alkaline ""power foods."" Fruit that is fresh, with the exception of cranberries and plums, are also alkaline foods. Some dried fruits, dates and figs, count as well. Milk and almonds are generally alkaline foods when eaten on their own.


If you forget the precise list, just go for leafy vegetables and bright fruits, such as watermelon.
Alkaline foods are not processed, so if you find yourself buying canned or prepackaged, do a double-check. Even prepackaged lettuce (in salad mixes) can diminish the health benefits.;
, Meat, fish, poultry and eggs are generally acidic foods. Cereal, grains, and nuts are usually acid producing as well. Cheese is another common culprit with parmesan being ranked as the most acidic.Meat, fish, dairy products, caffeine, sugar and salt are the most acid forming foods.Be aware that even seemingly healthy items, such as wild cooked trout or salmon, can raise your body’s acid levels.
Choosing low-fat versions of some foods, such as milk, can lower acid levels. This is a good compromise measure for those people who don’t want to drastically change their diet.

, A wide variety of waters are considered neutral — tap water, spring water, river water, and even sea water. They all exist at the center of the pH scale, ranking at 7.0. Olive oil and egg whites are also commonly considered to be neutral in nature."
"
Eat primarily alkaline-producing foods.,
Consume fresh vegetables and fruits.,
Eat unprocessed grains and starches.,
Limit fats and sugars.",How to Mix Alkaline and Acidic Foods2," For every one serving of an acidic food, you should have four servings of an alkaline food. In order for the body to function at optimal efficiency, it must maintain a pH balance of 7.4. Eating additional alkaline foods keeps your body from taking nutrients from other areas in order to neutralize an acid-heavy diet.If you want to be even more precise, you can invest in a food scale. Weigh each food portion carefully and write down the results in a notebook divided into two acid/alkaline columns. At the end of each day, add the columns up to see how close you got to the 4 per 1 ratio.
For example, for lunch you could have a veggie sandwich. Try using whole-grain bread with hummus, avocados, and cucumbers packed inside. Fruit is always a good breakfast option.

, This will provide you with the maximum nutritional benefit. If fresh produce is not available, frozen is the next best alternative. Canned produce should usually be avoided as it contains high levels of sodium and other add-ons.


Not all vegetables and fruits are the same or equal, however. Try to vary your intake of produce so that you get the full array of benefits. Asparagus, for example, assists with the nervous system. Watermelon is helpful for hydration as it is 92% water., Although grains are usually acidic, there are natural options that count as alkaline. Purchase grains that are minimally packaged, the closer to fresh the better. Be creative when choosing grains.


For example, amaranth is one that many people aren’t familiar with. It is high in protein, which is unusual for a grain.Quinoa, buckwheat, and millet are other grain options.

, This is always part of a healthy diet, but when you are mixing food categories, it is particularly important. Most people consume artificial and processed foods in these categories. Consuming foods high in fat and sugar pushes your pH level into acidic territory and can contribute to a host of health problems including diabetes and kidney damage.Instead of eliminating desserts entirely, you might try making sweet treats from acidic foods, such as melons or apples. You will feel less deprived and make some progress toward your food combining goals.
Watch your drink consumption as well. Many sugary drinks, such as soda, will throw off your pH balance as well. Just drinking one soda a day can increase your diabetes risk by 26%."
"
Visualize the pH scale.,
Think of the effect on the body.,
Monitor via body awareness.,
Combine for the right reasons.",How to Mix Alkaline and Acidic Foods3," Picture a line with “1” on one end and “14” on the other. The acidity or alkalinity of food will fall somewhere on this line. A strong alkali will have a high value, such as 14, while a strong acid will have a low value, such as one. Neutrals, such as water, will have a pH value of seven.The pH measures the concentration of dissolved hydrogen ions, which then indicates acidity or alkalinity.
You can measure the pH for more than just foods. Bleach, for example, has a pH of 13. Battery acid has a pH of zero., Human blood maintains a pH of about 7.4. All major systems of the body work together in order to keep this number as consistent as possible. When you consider a food combination diet, the idea is that you are lessening some of the work that your body has to do to maintain balance.Be aware of a food’s PRAL or “potential renal acid load” score. Simply put, a food can be acidic in composition, but can change to alkaline when you ingest it. Lemons and tomatoes are good examples of this transition. So, it may be helpful to print out a alkaline/acid reference sheet when shopping., Gauge the success of your food combining by how you feel and whether or not your medical numbers (blood pressure, blood sugar levels, etc.) improve over time. Some people suggest testing the pH of your urine using test strips. However, this method may be quite inaccurate as your general medical history, the time of day the sample is collected, and medications can influence the results., Like any diet plan, you need to be committed to making a change in order for it to work. Sit and write down all of the health improvements that you hope to see as a result of following a combination food plan. For example, you might want to lose weight. If that is the case, ask yourself, “Is this the best possible way to safely lose weight?”


Attach time periods to your goals. Give yourself one month to see a change in blood sugar levels or two months to drop a jean size.
Consult a physician before changing your diet, some restrictive diets can interfere with your health. Your doctor will work with you to determine whether “food combining” is a good option for you.

Get treatment for related medical conditions.",How to Reverse Fatty Liver," If you have fatty liver disease and are overweight or obese, gradual weight loss can help reverse some of the damage to your liver.The key lies in losing the weight gradually. Aim for 1 to 2 lbs (450 to 900 g) a week. Losing more than that can cause complications.
Studies suggest that losing at least 9 percent of your weight over the course of several months can reverse the effects of fatty liver. Less weight loss than this may not reverse the damage, but it will still lessen current and future buildup of fat in the liver.
Lose the weight by maintaining a proper diet and staying physically active. Stay away from diet supplements or fad diets.;
, Staying physically active can help you drop weight or maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also improves circulation, which improves your body's ability to disperse fats throughout the body, and it also forces the body to use carbohydrates for energy instead of converting them into additional fats.


Light the moderate exercise is still better than nothing. If you are not accustomed to exercising, start small by committing to a 30 minute walk three to five times a week. Gradually increase that amount until you are walking every day of the week.
Cardiovascular exercises—activities that get your heart pumping, like walking, cycling, and swimming—are preferred over strength training exercises that focus on building muscle.

, Insulin is a hormone that stores fat, and as a result, you need to drop the insulin levels in your body if you want to reverse fatty liver disease. Simple sugars and refined carbohydrates increase the insulin in your body, so you should avoid them.The body digests these simple carbohydrates quickly, and as a result, you experience a spike in blood sugar after consuming them. Complex carbohydrates are healthier because they take longer for the body to break down and do not result in the same sort of dramatic blood sugar increase.
In particular, this includes food made with white flour and high amounts of sugar. These foods should be avoided altogether, but you also need to limit carbohydrates in general, even those made from whole grains.
Restrict your intake of bread, pasta, rice, cereal, cake, pastry, and snack foods made with flour.

, Vegetables offer healthy, complex carbohydrates in smaller doses than grains, so they have very little effect on blood sugar and insulin. They may even help cleanse fat from the liver and restore the organ's filtration abilities.You can eat vegetables raw or cooked, but avoid adding salad dressing or similar foods that may contain unhealthy fats.
For an added health boost, consider drinking two to three glasses of raw vegetable juice a week. Each glass should be 8 to 10 oz (250 to 300 ml) and contain 90 to 95 percent vegetables. The rest of the drink should contain fruit, rather than artificial sweeteners.
Fresh fruit can also help cleanse the liver, but you need to be careful when consuming it since fruit also contains a higher dose of sugar and can cause insulin problems.

, Protein does not have any harmful effects on your blood sugar or insulin levels. If anything, it can help keep your blood sugar levels stable. Protein also reduces hunger, making it easier for you to eat less and lose weight.


Try to get your protein from healthy sources, including eggs, poultry, low-fat meats, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes, and low-fat dairy.

, You might think that a low-fat diet would help reverse the effects of fatty liver, but this is only partially true. You should avoid unhealthy fats found in ""junk food"" like potato chips and pizza, but you need to include healthy fats in your diet if you want your body to be fully nourished.


Look for healthy fats in food sources like seafood, olive oil, nut oils, nut butters, raw nuts, seeds, and eggs.

, Alcohol is a major cause of fatty liver. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, you should still cut alcohol from your diet or severely restrict it.


Alcohol causes inflammation and damages your liver cells. As a result, the liver becomes weak against fat cells and allows those fat cells to build up.
Some unconventional research performed by the University of California-San Diego School of Medicine suggests that drinking one glass of wine each day can actually decrease and reverse nonalcoholic fatty liver. The risk of further liver disease can even be cut in half. This only applies to wine, though, and not to other types of alcohol. Beer and other liquor will increase the risk of further liver damage., Your liver acts as a filter. While many medications have no impact on your liver, many others can actually cause your liver to become weakened or damaged. Avoiding these medications can slow or reverse fatty liver disease.


Medications known to have a negative effect on the liver include analgesic drugs (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen), antibiotics, gastrointestinal drugs, cardiovascular drugs, hypoglycemic agents, contraceptive drugs, sex hormone treatments, anti-neoplastic agents, anti-psychotic drugs, anti-epileptic drugs, and anti-tuberculosis drugs.

,


A study performed at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center indicated that vitamin E can lower some liver enzymes that are commonly believed to advance liver disease. It may even be able to heal some liver scarring.

, Use 1,000 mg of supplemental Omega-3 fatty acids each day. These fatty acids can be obtained through fish oil capsules.


The British Medical Journal reported that this amount of Omega-3 fats can decrease the serum markers associated with liver cell damage. It may also be able to lower triglyceride levels and glucose levels in the body, thereby lowering common risk factors associated with fatty liver disease.

, Take a daily milk thistle supplemental capsule or brew a cup of tea using a milk thistle tea bag. You can also combine 10 drops of milk thistle extract directly into a glass of water.


Silymarin, which is found in milk thistle, serves as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Some research suggests that it can directly affect liver function by reducing the release of harmful cytokines from an inflamed liver. As a result, the liver can more easily undergo a natural healing process, during which its fat accumulation can decline.

, Drink two to three cups of green tea on a daily basis. If this does not appeal to you, then take 600 mg of supplemental green tea extract daily.More precisely, you can find supplemental green tea extract by purchasing supplements containing catechins derived from decaffeinated green tea.
Some studies suggest that green tea and catechins derived from green tea can decrease intestinal fat absorption and storage. They can also encourage the oxidation of fatty acids, thereby helping your body use those fatty acids for energy.

, Take a daily probiotic capsule. For an even more natural approach, you could also obtain probiotics through foods that contain healthy live bacteria or yeast. Yogurt, for instance, tends to be high in probiotics.


While there are no firm conclusions yet, some research suggests that the consumption of healthy bacteria can counteract the effects of an unhealthy or unbalanced diet. Since fatty liver disease can be connected to unhealthy diets, probiotics may help combat and reverse this form of liver damage.

, Fatty liver is often linked to diabetes, and early research suggests that some diabetes medications might also have a positive effect on fatty liver. In particular, look at metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone.


Metformin is an oral diabetes medication that controls blood sugar levels.Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone force the cells in your body to become more sensitive to the insulin your body produces. As a result, your body makes less insulin and your blood sugar drops., This medication is usually used for weight loss, but it is also being investigated as a treatment for fatty liver. It blocks the absorption of some fat from your food, and as a result, less fat can be absorbed by the liver and the rest of your body., In particular, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver care. Together, the two of you can figure out which treatments are working for you and what you need to avoid.

, People with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease often have other medical problems related to their insulin levels and the amount of fat stored in their bodies. Ask your doctor if you are at risk for some of these diseases.


Diseases commonly associated with fatty liver include diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

Seek help if you have an eating disorder.,
Identify real hunger.,
Distract yourself.If you really don't want to eat right now, do something fun to take your mind off of your hunger.,
Change your attitude toward hunger.Instead of thinking of hunger as a problem to be solved by eating or engaging in some other behavior, look at it as an opportunity.,
Stick to a routine.Continue your daily routine uninterrupted, as if you aren’t hungry at all.",How to Resist Hunger1," There are a variety of eating disorders, but all are characterized by an unhealthy relationship to food. Excessive attention to what you’re eating, calorie counting, excessive exercise, and binging and/or purging are the hallmarks of eating disorders. If you obsess about your body weight or worry that you’re too fat or too thin, you probably have an eating disorder.Since eating disorders can be difficult to solve alone, consult a trained therapist if you struggle with body-image issues or have an eating disorder.
Seek help from a support group related to your specific eating disorder or to eating disorders generally. Find a meeting near you through organizations like Eating Disorders Anonymous or the National Eating Disorders Association.;
, Resisting hunger is not the same as resisting starvation. Neither is it the same as resisting the urge to eat even when you’re full. In order to resist hunger, you must first understand its defining features. These include:Thinking about food
A growling stomach
Mental plans to eat soon
Starvation, by contrast, is characterized by low blood sugar levels, jitteriness, and/or a sense of lightheadedness. Starving feels uncomfortable.
Be aware of your own body and its food-related feedback. If you are satisfied or full, put down the fork and do not continue eating. If you are hungry, it is important to eat a healthy meal.
Develop an intuitive and friendly relationship with your appetite by knowing the difference between real hunger and simple food cravings.

, Ride your bike, read a book, or have an interesting conversation with a friend. Instead of focusing over your hunger, redirect your attention elsewhere.


Don’t do anything you find boring, or you will have a hard time not focusing on your hunger. Studying tedious subjects or doing difficult work are not good activities when trying to distract yourself from hunger.
Try to engage senses unrelated to food.Hunger is often inspired by the sight, smell, or taste of food. Redirect your senses by, for instance, putting some music on. Sing along and get into the groove. Learn the lyrics if you don't know them yet.
Visual distractions are also useful. For instance, playing a video game might help reduce intrusive thoughts of food.

, If you’re trying to lose weight, for instance, think about how your unsatisfied hunger indicates that you’re losing weight. If you’re fasting, think about how staying true to the fast will grant you spiritual strength and improve your willpower.


You could also feel thankful about how much time you’re saving by not eating and spending time in the hot kitchen.
Think about a time you ate too much and had a stomachache. Recalling this experience might help you resist hunger.

, Using this method, there’s no need to take extra steps to distract yourself from your hunger. Instead, just live your life until the hunger has subsided. Remember, hunger doesn’t last forever. Once you learn to let your feelings of hunger pass, you’ll enter a state where (at least temporarily) you are not hungry.

Ensure your bedroom is quiet and at a comfortable temperature.

, There are many commercially available appetite suppressants. Try several and see which works for you. You could also try a natural supplement like St. John’s Wort, which is readily available at most health food stores in capsule form.


Don’t confuse appetite suppressants with weight-loss pills. The latter are designed to speed up your metabolism, making you lose weight, while the former are intended to keep you from feeling hungry in the first place.
The US FDA does not regulate dietary supplements before they hit the shelf, although they can later take action if the supplement causes harm or makes false claims.Take them at your own risk and consider consulting a medical professional.

, Short, intense workouts are especially effective at helping you resist feelings of hunger.If you want to resist hunger, go for a run, ride your bike, or go swimming for approximately 25 minutes. Try to really push yourself to the limit.

Change your snacking habits.If you typically snack at a certain time -- for instance, when you’re watching TV -- you might have become used to eating when engaged in that activity.,
Avoid crash diets.",How to Resist Hunger3," Set a regular and realistic time for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Set an alarm on your phone or watch to indicate when it is time for your next meal. That way, you will be able to stay on track with your scheduled meal times.


A regular eating schedule will condition you to resist hunger only until your scheduled meal time. When your designated meal time arrives, you will become hungry in expectation of the coming meal.
If you work a hectic schedule and cannot set regular meal times for yourself, try to think ahead to the next time you’re going to eat.

, Eat a hearty breakfast first thing in the morning in order to resist feeling hungry later in the day.


A good breakfast should avoid added sugar.
Incorporate fresh fruits like apples, berries, and melon into your breakfast.
Choose cereal, pancakes, bagels, or toast of whole grains. These have more fiber than other types of grains, and will help you resist hunger.
Plan ahead. Decide what you’ll have for breakfast the night before you eat it. Set bowls, utensils, and ingredients out the night before so everything is ready to go in the morning., It won't abolish hunger, but it will help. Besides, water is good for you, and thirst can easily be mistaken for hunger if you don't drink enough.


Aim to drink at least 20 ounces of water per day.
Instead of water, you could also try herbal tea., Eat several small (200-400 calorie), frequent meals and snacks throughout the day. Eat filling, fibrous foods that release energy slowly throughout the day like fruit with granola, a small sandwich on whole wheat, and some fresh vegetables and hummus as a snack.


Fiber will keep you feeling full.
Keep a healthy, low-calorie snack on hand. A granola bar, apple slices, or a banana are good options. Break your snack of choice out when you feel hungry and need a little pick-me-up. This way, you won’t let your hunger lead you to fill up on a whole meal.
Hunger usually strikes about four to five hours after a healthy meal.Set your watch to indicate when four hours has elapsed after your last meal, and help yourself to a snack then (if necessary).

, Juice and soda can add up to quite a few calories, but will not make you feel as full as solid food. Stick to water instead, and fill up on whole fruit and other filling snacks., Eggs, rice, and beverages readily absorb blue food dye.


Use natural food dye from a grocery store to dye your food.
You could also sit in a room with blue walls, or put your food on a blue plate.

, To resist feelings of hunger, eat plenty of lean protein like nuts, beans, and soy. Avoid eating red meat, however, as it can increase your risk for cancer and heart disease.Most people need about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. If you are very active, you’ll need slightly more per day.
Use the USDA fitness calculator to figure out how much protein you need each day.
Use protein powders to make shakes and smoothies for yourself. These can function as meal replacements if you’re interested in losing weight as well as resisting hunger.

, Replace the act of eating with another activity. Instead of eating in front of the TV, for instance, you could do curls with dumbbells, or sip a cup of herbal tea.

, Crash diets or “cleanse” diets are those in which you dramatically reduce the amount of food you’re eating to 800 calories per day or less.Not only are these diets ineffective, as you’re likely to regain any lost weight within six months following the end of the diet, but you also risk compromising your immune system, dehydration, and heart palpitations.


If your goal is to lose weight, the only tried-and-true way to do so is to get regular exercise and eat a healthy diet.

Strengthen your triceps and your pectorals with tricep push ups.,
Challenge yourself with 2-2-2 push ups.,
Do tricep dips with a chair.,
Use free weights to do dumbbell tricep kickbacks.,
Try bicep curls.,
Do uppercuts with free weights.,
Try side plank with dumbbell raises.",How to Reduce Fat in Arms (for Women)1," Tricep push ups are simple exercises that can really work your tricep muscles, your pectoral muscles, and your shoulder muscles. If you are new to push ups, you may want to modify this exercise by dropping your legs to the ground so you can build strength in your arms over time.To do tricep push ups, place your hands underneath your shoulders on an exercise mat. Make sure your fingers are spread wide and weight is distributed evenly between the two hands. Squeeze your abdominal muscles and straighten your legs behind you, coming up on the balls of your feet. Activate your leg muscles and push out from your heels. Your body should feel well supported and your lower back should be straight, not dipping or swaying from side to side.
If you cannot hold the starting position, modify it by dropping to your knees, keeping your arms and shoulders straight. Keep your head in alignment with your back and lower your chest towards the floor. Your elbows should be tucked into your sides as you hover over your fingertips. It’s completely fine if you can only lower your body a few inches. The more often you do tricep push ups, the easier they become.
Exhale as you press back up to the starting position. This is one rep. Do three reps of eight tricep push ups to start to build up your tricep muscles.;
, If you feel comfortable with tricep push ups, you may want to try a variation on tricep pushups. The “2-2-2” push ups refer to three sets of two push ups using different hand placements: narrow, regular, and wide. The narrow push ups will work your tricep muscles and the wide push ups will work your chest muscles.Start in a plank position, with your shoulders directly under your hands and your hands shoulder width apart. Keep your core engaged and activate your leg muscles so your plank is strong and straight.
Do two push ups with regular hand placement. Then, move your hands wider so they are on the edge of your exercise mat. Do two push ups with this wide hand placement. Finally, move your hands into the center of the mat so your hands form a triangle directly under the middle of your chest. Do two push ups with this narrow hand placement.

, This exercise only requires access to a chair but it will help to strengthen your tricep muscles and give them more definition.Start by placing a chair on a sturdy surface against a wall with the seat facing towards you. You can also do tricep dips on the edge of a counter, staircase (such as the 2nd or 3rd step from the bottom), or a workout bench. Stand one to two feet in front of the edge of the seat of the chair. Place your hands behind you, shoulder width apart with your fingers gripping the edge of the chair. Bend your knees so they are at a 90 degree angle and your knees are directly above your ankles.
Make sure there is equal balance in your arms and legs. Inhale as you bend your elbows and bring your butt towards the floor. Look forward as you lower your body and make sure your arms bend at a 90 degree angle. Only bend your arms until you feel your arm muscles activating and working.
Exhale as you raise your body back to the starting position. Do this gently and slowly so you do not hyperextend your shoulders. Be sure to retract your shoulder blades and keep your shoulders square and stabilized (not rolled forward or up). As soon as it is difficult to hold your shoulders still and pulled back, stop the range of motion. This is one rep. Repeat this exercise for two sets of ten reps. You should feel your tricep muscles working after two sets of this exercise.

, To do this arm strengthening exercise, you will need access to free weights and a workout bench or chair. If you are new to weightlifting, start with one to five pound weights so you can build your arm strength without hurting yourself.Begin with a free weight in your right hand. Rest your left hand and bent left leg on the exercise bench. Your left hand should be directly under your left shoulder so it supports your body. Bend your right hand while holding the free weight, making sure your back is straight and your torso is almost parallel to the floor. Form a 90 degree angle between your forearm and your upper arm. Keep your head up and your neck straight.
Exhale and use your triceps to lift the weight until your right arm is fully extended behind you. Supinate by turning your palm up as your arm moves back, so that your palm faces the ceiling. Move only your forearm and do not use your left hand or your legs. Pause once your right arm is fully extended, inhale, and then exhale as you bring the free weight back to the starting position.
Repeat the dumbbell tricep kickbacks on the right side ten times, then switch to the left side. Do two sets of ten reps on both sides.

, This exercise will work the muscles on the front of your arms, known as your biceps. You will need a set of five-pound dumbbells to do this exercise.Begin with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your knees soft and equal weight in your feet. Hold a five-pound dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward.
Exhale as you curl the dumbbells towards your chest. Keep your gaze forward and your weight equal in your legs. Inhale and then lower the dumbbells until they are three quarters of the way down. Activate your biceps muscles as you do this. This is one rep. Repeat this exercise for two sets of ten reps.

, Tone your upper arms and strengthen your shoulder muscles by doing weighted uppercut punches. You will need a set of one to two pound weights to do this exercise.Begin with your feet hip-width apart and a one to two pound weight in each hand. Hold your fists in front of your face with your palms facing each other.
Keep your left fist stationary as you inhale and punch your right fist up as high as possible. Make sure your arm is slightly bent and do not lock your elbow as you punch. Exhale as you bring your right fist back to the starting position. Then, inhale as you punch your left fist upward as high as possible.
Alternate from your right hand to your left hand for 60 seconds. Gradually increase speed until you are punching upward as fast as you can. Repeat this exercise for one to two minutes a day.

, This exercise will work your arm muscles and your core muscles at the same time. You will need a one to five pound dumbbell or free-weight for this exercise.Start in side plank on your right elbow with your elbow stacked directly below your shoulder and your feet stacked on top of each other. Lift the dumbbell in your left hand.
Raise your hips so your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. Squeeze your right hand into a fist to find your balance and activate your arms muscles. Then, inhale as you extend your left arm so it is directly above your right shoulder. Grip the dumbbell as you raise your left arm.
Exhale as you lower your left arm back down so it is parallel to the ground and in front of your body. Keep your hips lifted as you lower your left arm. Repeat this exercise ten times on each side.

Choose gluten-free foods at restaurants.",How to Reduce Gluten Intake," With any diet change or restriction, it's always important to talk to your doctor first. They will be able to tell you what's absolutely necessary and important for you to avoid in your diet.


If you have been diagnosed with Celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity, talk to your doctor about the best way to avoid gluten in your diet. Also, ask if there is any medication or dietary supplements they recommend to ensure that you're consuming adequate amounts of all essential nutrients.
Ask your doctor for resources on gluten-free living. There are a variety of things to consider as you embark on this new diet.
If you do not have an allergy or Celiac's disease, there is no medical reason to completely eliminate gluten containing foods (or any other foods) from your diet. However, if you've tried following a gluten-free diet and you feel better or you feel healthier, then by all means continue following the eating pattern that makes you feel your best.;
, The first and most important part of reducing the amount of gluten in your diet, is being able to read food labels and front of pack marketing on food packages. This will help you decide what you can and cannot eat.


Recently, there was legislation passed that defined what ""gluten-free"" means on labels. Although food manufacturers are not required to label products as gluten-free, if they do, they must comply with the following definition: ""the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.""Although true gluten-free products may contain less than 20 ppm, it has been proven that these levels of gluten do not cause adverse side effects in those who have Celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity.Many foods will be labeled as gluten-free. However, there are some foods that are not required to have any labeling in regards to gluten and these include: meat, shelled eggs, liquor, wine and beer.Do not get confused by the claim of ""wheat free."" This doesn't always mean the product is gluten-free. It should specifically say ""contains no gluten or gluten-free.""
Also read labels on medications, supplements, cosmetics and play dough as these items may also contain gluten.The ""gluten-free"" labeling may appear in a variety of places on food packages. Check the front, back, nutrition fact panel and near the ingredient list for these claims. If a product doesn't specifically say ""gluten-free"" and you're unsure if it would contain gluten, do not purchase or consume it.

, If you want or need to follow a gluten-free diet, one of the first steps is to clean out your kitchen. You'll need to remove all food containing gluten so that you not longer consume or cook them.


Read all the labels and ingredient lists to ensure you find every single item containing gluten. If you're unsure if a food has gluten, stick to the safe side and get rid of it.
Check the pantry first. This is most likely where you'll find the most gluten containing products. Items that may contain gluten could include: bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, chips, cereals, pancake or waffle mix, tortillas, condiments and sauces, or croutons.
Your refrigerator or freezer may also have some gluten containing foods like: marinades, dressings, sauces, frozen waffles and pancakes, beer, fresh pasta or soy sauce.
You can either discard foods (especially if they've been open), give them away to friends or family or donate unopened items to a food bank.
In addition make sure to sanitize and thoroughly cleanse any cutlery or dishes that have come into contact with gluten containing foods. Even if you have all gluten-free products in your house, but use contaminated cutlery, you can transfer small particles of gluten to foods and it may cause a reaction in those who are sensitive to it.

, After you've cleared out your kitchen, you'll want to consider replacing some of those items with gluten-free alternatives.


Some items will be easy to replace by just switching to a gluten-free version. For example, switch to gluten-free soy sauce, dressings and marinades. It's also simple to make these at home using gluten-free ingredients.
You may also consider switching to all gluten-free grains (like breads, rice, pasta, waffles or crackers). However, many gluten-free versions of these foods have different tastes and textures due to the lack of gluten. Be prepared for these to be a little different than what you're used to.
One thing to note about many gluten-free foods is that they are frequently higher in calories and other ingredients due to the increased processing required to make these items. If weight is an issue, make sure to be aware of the extra calories you may be ingesting by switching to all gluten-free foods.
You may also want to consider switching the grocery store where you do the majority of your food shopping. Since gluten-free foods have become much more popular, there are many health food stores, organic grocery stores and speciality grocery stores that offer a much larger array of gluten-free foods. Find one in your area especially if your local grocer doesn't offer a wide enough variety of appropriate foods.

, Following a gluten-free diet can be difficult at first. Gluten is surprisingly present in many foods. This can make following a gluten-free diet a little overwhelming at first.


Talking to a registered dietitian who is a health and nutrition expert is a smart option to start with. Many dietitians are specialized in the areas of Celiac's disease and other food allergies.
Search for a local RD online or ask your doctor (especially the doctor who has diagnosed you with either Celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity) to refer you to a local or specialized RD.
Talk with the dietitian about your current diet, your worries regarding switching to a gluten-free diet and to help give you tips for meal planning, cooking and eating out.

, After being diagnosed with a condition that requires you to be gluten-free, you'll need to re-learn how to cook and prep your meals without gluten-containing foods. Sometimes this might be very easy, while other times it can be more difficult.


Swap out your typical pasta, bread or wraps for gluten-free items. Make sure you read every label to ensure you're purchasing a gluten-free item. However, it should be very easy to find these items gluten-free.
Many food manufacturers use corn, quinoa, bean or rice flours to make gluten-free versions of items like bread, wraps, pasta, muffins or bagels.
Bake with gluten-free flour mixes. If you want to avoid the overly processed gluten-free substitutes on the market, you may consider making your own. Many grocery stores sell specific flour mixes that are gluten-free and make baking very easy to do at home.

, Although you will be restricting many items from your diet, there are still plenty of foods that you can and should eat on a regular basis. Most importantly is fruits and vegetables.


Both of these food groups are naturally gluten-free. In addition, they are also naturally low in calories, but high in a fiber, vitamins and minerals.Include a fruit or vegetable at each meal to help balance out your diet. Measure yourself: 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or 1 small piece or about 1/2 cup of fruit.If you typically purchase canned, frozen or other processed fruits and vegetables, double check the labels to make sure they are gluten-free. Typically all fruits and vegetables are gluten-free but if they have been even minimally processed, they make have been exposed to other gluten-containing products or may be mixed with seasonings or sauces that contain gluten., In addition to fruits and vegetables, it's also important to still include adequate amounts of protein at each meal.


Most protein sources in their raw form are also gluten-free. You need to be careful when you get into protein sources that are pre-cooked, come as a part of a pre-made meal or are served with any sauces or gravies that could contain gluten.
Protein is an essential nutrient for everyone's diet. Including 1 or 2 servings at each meal can help ensure you're consuming enough for your body.
Measure out a 3-4 oz serving of protein.If you're watching your waistline, stick to leaner protein options like: poultry, eggs, low-fat beef, pork, seafood or low-fat dairy.

, Although gluten seems to be present in many grains and many different foods, there are types of grains and starches that are 100% gluten-free and can be consumed without worry.Try:


Rice
Corn
Quinoa
Millet
Buckwheat
Teff
Gluten-free oats (double check the label)
Amaranth

, If you're avoiding large quantities of food or entire food groups due to an allergy or sensitivity, it's advised to consider taking supplements to help you meet your daily recommended intakes of a variety of vitamins or minerals.


Vitamin supplements may be needed, especially in those who have celiac's disease. If your disease is untreated or you have a flare up, you're at risk for not absorbing iron, folate, B12, Vitamin D, zinc and magnesium appropriately.Even if your Celiac's disease is properly treated, a few daily supplements can ensure you're absorbing every nutrient properly.
It's typically recommended to take a daily multivitamin, plus extra iron, b12 and Vitamin D. Your doctor will give you specific dosages for each item depending on your most recent blood work.
Always tell your doctor what supplements you're taking, the dosage and the frequency you're taking them.

, Dining out might be intimidating if you have Celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity. However, with careful planning and ordering, you can enjoy restaurant meals without worry.


Call ahead to restaurants and talk to the manager about whether or the restaurant can accommodate your needs. As gluten sensitivities and allergies have become more recognized, many places can offer gluten-free meals without a problem. But it's always smart to check.
Always talk to your waiter and inform them of your allergy or condition. Ask that they inform the manager and chef and other cooks to make sure that everyone who will be handling your food is made aware that your meal should be gluten-free.
To be on the safe side, you might want to consider ordering more plain dishes or ordering dishes without the typical added seasonings or sauces.

Try tennis or another racket sport.,
Take up rowing or kayaking.,
Try boxing lessons.",How to Reduce Fat in Arms (for Women)2," Racket sports like tennis or squash are great for building arm muscles and for a total body workout. Join a recreational tennis league in your area or take tennis lessons from the tennis pro at your gym. If a family member enjoys playing squash or racket ball, ask them to give you lessons and practice your skills. You should notice marked improvements in your arm strength and better arm muscle definition the more you play racket sports.

, Doing a sport that activates your arm muscles will help you to tone your arm muscles. Consider taking up an arm focused hobby like rowing or kayaking, which requires arm strength and good core engagement. You can start by doing the rowing machine at the gym and then work up to taking classes in rowing or kayaking. You can also join a recreational rowing team in your area to get better at rowing and be more active on a weekly basis.

, Another high intensity arm sport is boxing, which requires solid arm muscle strength and good overall fitness. Take boxing lessons at your gym or hit a hanging bean bag on your own. Punching a bean bag can help to build your arm strength and punching drills with a sparring partner can also allow you to tone your arm muscles.

Adjust your daily calorie intake.,
Commit to a seven day meal plan.,
Stay hydrated with water instead of sugary drinks.,
Eat well before and after you exercise.",How to Reduce Fat in Arms (for Women)3," Adjust your calorie intake so you are not overeating or eating empty calories that can only add more fat to your arms. Once you calculate your calorie intake per day, which is based on your age, your weight, and your fitness level, try to consume enough calories every day to do exercise.


Eat more vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein. Each meal should include a serving of protein, one or two vegetable/fruit servings, and one complex carbohydrate serving such as a whole grain serving. Make sure your carb intake is in the recommended range of 20 to 50 grams (0.71 to 1.8 oz) per a day.Reduce your consumption of carbs, sugars, and animal fats. Consuming foods high in carbs and sugars will cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels drop, this allows your body to burn fat. Lower insulin levels also help your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight you are carrying.Cut out foods that are high in starch and carbs like French fries, potato chips and white bread. Avoid foods high in artificial sugars like soft drinks, cakes, candy, and junk food.

, Create a seven day meal plan that covers three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), scheduled at the same time of day, and two small snacks (between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner), scheduled at the same time of day. A set meal plan will ensure you eat at a consistent time every day and do not skip or miss a meal. Consuming about 1,400 calories a day, combined with exercise, can help you to achieve healthy weight loss.Write up a grocery list based on your meal plan and go food shopping at the beginning of the week. Keep your fridge stocked with all the necessary ingredients to make your meals for the week so you can prepare each meal easily and are not tempted to cheat or skip a meal., Staying hydrated with water will keep your immune system healthy and ensure you are hydrated during your daily workout.You can substitute sugary drinks like soda with water flavored with slices of lemon or lime.
Try unsweetened green tea as a healthy substitute for sugary drinks. Unsweetened green tea has a healthy amount of antioxidants and promotes overall health.

, To maintain your weight loss, you should always eat healthy before and after you do any exercise. Have a small light snack one to two hours before you work out so you have enough energy during your workout.


Your post-work meals should be high in protein and carbohydrates and you should always eat within two hours of your workout. A meal like low-fat Greek yogurt with a few tablespoons of granola and fruit or a peanut butter and banana sandwich made with one slice of whole grain bread can help your body to recover after a workout and improve your muscle strength.

Bring water and other healthy beverages to work.",How to Resist Vending Snacks at Work1," In addition to speeding up your metabolism, fruit and vegetables contain nutrients that will boost your energy throughout the day. Examples of fruits and vegetables you can eat at your desk are bananas, apples, carrots, celery, grapes, and oranges.;
, Foods that are high in fiber will make you feel more full throughout the day, which can help you resist trips to the vending machine. In addition to fruit and vegetables, other examples of snacks that are high in fiber are nuts, whole-grains, and wheat products.

, Buying pre-packaged foods can help you save on food preparation time during busy work days. Examples of pre-packaged snacks you can buy and bring to work are granola or cereal bars, tuna salad kits, yogurt, cheese, and crackers.

, For example, if you purchase soda from vending machines throughout the day for its caffeine content, bring coffee or tea bags instead, which are often healthier alternatives to soda.


Bring a reusable water jug or coffee cup to work so you can refill on water, tea, or coffee throughout the day. This can help prevent you from buying multiple drinks from the vending machine on a daily basis.

Visit your doctor.",How to Raise Your Blood Sodium Level," Drinking plenty of water can dilute the sodium in your bloodstream causing your sodium levels to decrease. It also increases the risk of water retention in the body -- the more you consume, the more you'll retain.


You can safely reduce your daily intake of water. Instead of drinking 2000mL or more each day, if you know you already have hyponatremia, try drinking 1000mL to 1500mL of water each day. This will help the sodium in your body not to be diluted and excreted away through urine or sweating.
Increase fluid intake only in certain conditions, like warm weather or exercising Sweating may cause fluid loss and thereby you become easily dehydrated, which is not the goal.;
, If you’re an athlete or a person who performs a lot of activities and who sweats a lot, you may find sports drinks helpful. Drinking sports drinks will help you negate the lost sodium electrolytes in your blood stream.


Any sports drink like Gatorade contains the electrolytes that you will be needing if you released excessive amount of fluid, such as sweat or vomit.
Sports drinks usually contain the essential electrolytes that are most helpful, especially sodium and potassium electrolytes.

, Not everyone enjoys sports drinks and, what's more, sports drinks aren't always available. Here are some viable alternatives:



Saline water. You can make this at home and it will quickly replace your lost sodium in your body. Just have a glass of water with a pinch of salt, mix, and then drink.

Coconut water. This contains a lot of electrolytes and is good for dehydration. It contains sodium, magnesium and a lot of potassium.

Banana. Eat 1 to 2 pieces of banana after vigorous activity because of its high potassium content.

, If you think you lost sodium through sweating or by any other means, you can easily replace them in your next meal. This can help increase and replace back the sodium lost between activities. Example of high sodium foods are:Table salt. 1 teaspoon of table salt is the daily recommendation (2300mg)

Broths or soup. A 5mg bouillon cube contains about 1200mg of sodium

Salami. One slice of salami contains 226mg of sodium

Bacon. One strip of bacon contains 194mg of sodium

Cheese. 100g of cheese contains 215mg of sodium

Olives. 100g of olive contains 1556mg of sodium

Soy sauce. 1 tsp. of soy sauce contain 335mg

Caviar. A 100g of this food contains about 1500mg of sodium

, Sodium is readily available in most foods that we eat. The healthiest way to increase sodium in the blood is to take in fruits and vegetables containing sodium. Processed foods are also rich in sodium, but most health experts suggest eating fresh products.A cup of vegetable juice has 500mg of sodium. Add shredded cardoon, carrots and celery in a blender added with a pinch of salt to make a tasty juice.
Sweet potatoes and spinach are also rich in sodium. If you’re too busy to prepare that, try canned navy beans with 1,174 mg of sodium per cup or canned olives. One serving with 5 pickled olives can add 550 mg of sodium.
Fruits like mammy apple, guavas and passion fruits contain 50mg to 130 mg of sodium.
Processed fruits contain additional 50 mg sodium according to the U.S Department of Agriculture.

, Meat soup and soup stock from bones are rich sources of sodium. Meat loaf and beef stew are also high in sodium. If fruits and vegetables don't strike your fancy, know that you can get it from animal sources as well.


Lunch meats are a major source of sodium. In fact, most processed meat has plenty of sodium to add in preservation. That ranges from chicken nuggets to pizza to fast food hamburgers. If you're not careful, it's an easy, unhealthy way to get too much sodium., Unless you have a pre-existing medical condition and have a prescription from your doctor, don’t take diuretics. These are better known as “water pills” because they produce a substance that stimulates urine production thus preventing water retention in the body. However, you'll also lose sodium; as a result, you'll be dehydrated.


The function of this medication is to get rid of water and sodium in the body. By taking this type of medication, it will cause further loss of sodium which can be dangerous for an individual’s overall health.
Commonly known diuretics are Chlorothiazide (Diuril), Furosemide (Lasix), and Spironolactone (Aldactone).

, The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK recommends a maximum of 6g of salt per day for the average adult. This is equivalent to approximately one full teaspoon. It is rare that a high sodium diet is recommended.


Active individuals may require higher sodium levels than the average person. However, in some conditions where patients suffer from hyponatremia, increased sodium levels may be advised. Talk to your doctor if this applies to you.
Statistics show that 85% of Americans consume very high amounts of sodium. It's possible that your sodium levels are different than what you think they are.
Toddlers require 2 grams and young children only need 3g to 5g of salt. The maximum level of sodium recommended for average individuals, once again, is 6g (2300mg) per day.

, It’s important to note the right amount of fluid intake during exercise is different than when at rest. Estimate the amount of fluid loss from sweat and urination to determine the right amount of water intake.


Do not drink more than 800 mL of water per hour. During vigorous trainings, athletes may tend to drink a lot and overload the body with water. Clinical studies showed that marathon runners are found to experience hyponatremia relative to over consumption of water to replace fluids or in quenching thirst.
Vasopressin, a natural ant-diuretic hormone, increases during bouts of physical stress. The body tends to conserve water despite excessive sweating. In fact, physical stress brought about by running can reduce the excretion capacity of the kidneys to 100 milliliters per hour (normally 1 liter).

, Keep in mind that there are special conditions that require medical attention before starting a high sodium diet, especially in people with kidney disease, cardiovascular problems and osteoporosis. Before you change anything, consult your doctor.


There are very few people who require a high sodium diet. Most physicians recommend low sodium, as a matter of fact. A low fat and high protein diet is standard to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

, Decreased sodium electrolytes in the body can be harmful for you. Having severe hyponatremia can be fatal if it is left untreated. These are the following symptoms that will indicate a low sodium level:


Headache
Nausea and Vomiting
Fatigue or body weakness
Muscle twitching
Confusion
Irritability and restlessness

If you experience unconsciousness, seizure, and/or coma, this is a medical emergency. Go to the nearest hospital immediately.



, Note that all of these symptoms of hyponatremia happen because the brain is considered to be sensitive whenever there is low sodium levels (thereby manifesting these list of symptoms). This is why this condition can be so serious -- in the end, it wreaks havoc on your brain.Brain sensitivity is caused by very low blood sodium levels that cause an excessive amount of water to enter into the brain cells. This causes the cells to swell. When it reaches this point, medical intervention is necessary.

, If you experience these symptoms or otherwise suspect that your sodium levels are low, it's wise to visit your doctor. The right amount of sodium for you is a fine, fine line between enough but not too much. Your doctor will know what is best for your body.


This can be a serious condition if left untreated. Do follow the steps above, but don't hesitate to visit your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. While this can be alleviated with an adequate sodium/fluid balance, medical advice is always wise to seek to protect your health.

Separate your snacks into healthy-sized portions before bringing them to work.,
Store multiple sealed, or unopened snacks in your desk.,
Schedule snack-time into your work day.,
Eat snacks only when you are legitimately hungry.,
Make time in your daily schedule to leave work in pursuit of healthier snack options.",How to Resist Vending Snacks at Work2," By dividing your snacks into portions, you can prevent yourself from distractedly overeating while you work. For example, divide a large bag of trail mix into several plastic sandwich bags to prevent yourself from eating the entire bag of trail mix in one day at your desk.

, By keeping your desk stocked with healthy snacks, you can eat at your desk throughout the day without having to seek out a vending machine. For example, designate an empty drawer in your desk specifically for bags of trail mix, granola bars, and cans of tuna.

, By eating snacks every few hours or during breaks, you can maintain a healthy metabolism, and prevent yourself from starving, which can sometimes lead to impulse visits to the vending machine.


Eat a healthy snack during each designated break time. For example, if you bring 3 pieces of fruit in addition to your regular lunch meal, eat 1 piece before your work shift, 1 piece during your first break, and then the third piece during your last break before your shift ends.

, Sometimes if you are between projects or on a long conference call, boredom can lead to compulsive eating, or trips to the vending machine.


Drink water in place of eating if you recently ate a snack, or occupy yourself with another activity to distract your mind; such as reading a chapter out of a book, or reviewing documents related to your job.

, If you are unable to bring snacks to work, you can designate specific times to leave work to buy healthier snacks. For example, instead of going to the vending machine during break, walk or drive to a nearby store that sells fruit or vegetables.

Identify the source.,
Ignore the comment.,
Reciprocate awkward “compliments.” Sometimes, criticism comes in the form of a seemingly innocent compliment.,
Brush off the comment with a funny retort.,
Be selective about who and how you self-disclose.,
Become your own #1 fan.,
Practice self-compassion.,
Be willing to accept compliments.,
Highlight your best asset.,
Take care of yourself.,
Separate the good from the bad.,
Look for positive outlets for social support.,
Avoid sources of media that engage in body-shaming.",How to React to Comments About Your Weight," Think about the nature of your relationship with the other person before choosing an appropriate response. In some cases, it may not even be worth your time to say anything back.Is it a random stranger on the street? If the person doesn’t know you personally, don’t take the comment personal. Throw the stranger off by flashing a bright smile and keep walking.
Is it nosy relative who’s always making negative remarks? It may be time to correct them and let them know you will not accept insults. For example, if a relative asks you if you've gained weight, you could gracefully dodge the question by saying: ""I'm feeling great. How about you?""
Is it a parent who suffered from obesity as a child and is simply worried about you having to go through what they did? In this case, it can help to have sympathy for their situation and not take offense.;
, Not giving a reaction is perhaps the most powerful way you can stop a body-shamer in his or her tracks. Much of the time, this person is probably conveying a deeply held insecurity or misconception they have about health from childhood.If a body-shamer isn’t related to you and doesn’t know you personally, then their comments are probably directed at getting a reaction out of you to make themselves feel better. Don’t give them the satisfaction of reaction. Continue on your way as if the person didn’t say a thing to you.

, Consider that someone says “At least you have a pretty face…” You can throw the speaker off with your own witty remark by returning with “Thanks, so do you.” The person will be surprised at your response and likely won’t continue on that same topic for very long.

, Humor is always a great way deflect criticism and ease the awkwardness of someone’s ugly remark. While defensiveness can make others embarrassed for you, a well-timed joke can make them want to give you a high-five.Let’s say someone mentions how skinny you are by saying “Are you sure your parents have been feeding you?” You can respond with some quick-witted humor, like “Yikes! I had no idea I’d be questioned by the food police today!”

, In some cases, a person’s remark could strike a nerve because they don’t truly understand the circumstances of your weight gain or loss. If a relative or other acquaintance makes an ignorant comment about your weight, educate them.You can easily put unwelcome comments to rest by using self-disclosure. It’s likely this person is speaking without knowledge. Clarifying the situation can minimize future remarks. However, you should only share what you feel comfortable telling.
In response to “The last time I saw you, you were such a little thing. You’ve gotten so big!” You could use self-disclosure to educate this person by bluntly saying “I have a hormonal disorder that makes it difficult for me to lose weight. If you’d like, I can tell you more about what this has been like?...”

, People are often their own worst critics.Recognize that you are more than your body. Focus on all the things you love about yourself and give yourself a huge round of applause for being you.


One way to silence your inner critic—and not find yourself making horrible remarks to yourself about your weight—is to overload on self-flattery. Grab a pen and notepad and make a long, exhaustive list of all your greatest attributes. Write “I am…” in front of each trait to harness your unlimited inner power.If you run out of traits to add, enlist your close friends and family members to give you more ideas. These are the people who love and support you, so they will have many positive ways to describe you.
Go back over your list, reading it aloud on a daily basis. Notice the untapped power and confidence you feel when you start acknowledging all the things you have going for yourself.

, Loving yourself by showing self-compassion is also an effective way to improve your self-confidence and feel better about yourself. Some things you can do to practice self-compassion include:


Writing a compassionate letter to yourself. In the letter, imagine that you are writing from the perspective of a friend who loves you unconditionally. What might this person say to encourage you and make you feel better about the things people have said about your weight? Write yourself a letter from this perspective and read it often.Watching for self-critical talk. As a result of people saying negative things to you, you might internalize these messages and start to speak to yourself in a critical way. Watch out for these self-critical thoughts and try to challenge them as they occur. For example, if you catch yourself thinking, “You are disgusting!” then use compassion to change this thought by saying, “No, that is not true. I am a kind, caring, beautiful person.”Keeping a compassion journal of your daily activities. Another good way to nurture self-compassion is to write in a journal. In the journal, record all of the stressful, challenging, or upsetting events of your day. Then, write compassionate messages to yourself about these events. Aim to be understanding and comforting towards yourself. For example, you might write, “I understand how upsetting that was for you. It was very mature of you to just walk away from that person when she started commenting on your weight.”, When you are self-conscious about your body, even positive statements may be met with an awkward response from you. People with low self-esteem often feel uncomfortable when complimented because the comment contradicts their own self-views.Don’t minimize your positive traits by shaking off a compliment. Instead, accept compliments gracefully by simply replying with a humble “thank you” to show your gratitude.Over time, this practice will become easier and easier to do. And, over time, you may just start to believe them, too.

, Another way to build self-esteem is to focus on the physical features that you do like. It may take time for you to come to a place of acceptance about your body size or shape. However, there is probably some aspect about your appearance that you like right now. Focus more on these traits and less on the features that you are not so pleased with.Perhaps you like your eye color. If so, choose colors in your clothing, hair, or makeup that complement and accentuate your eyes. Maybe you pride yourself on having healthy, clear skin. Each time you look in the mirror, focus on how gorgeous your skin looks.
Try to “discover” new things that you like about your physical appearance. You may start to notice yourself warming to traits you once didn’t like as you develop greater self-confidence and self-acceptance. For example, you may not have liked how muscular your legs were before, but now you realize how useful they are when playing soccer.

, One research-backed method to increase self-esteem is to treat your body well.Due to genetics or certain medical conditions, a person can’t choose their unique body shape or size. You do have a choice of how you treat yourself though.


Take strides to fuel your body with healthy foods, get regular exercise, sleep 7 to 9 hours each night, dress comfortably for your body and engage in self-care on a daily basis.

, Learn how to identify negative commenters and those who are just concerned. If you find yourself having to constantly ignore, defend, or apologize for your body due to certain people’s comments, you must protect your well-being by removing these people from your life.


Getting distance can be particularly hard if it’s a close friend or family member, but it can be harmful to be around anyone who makes you feel bad about yourself.
Keep in mind that you or your body don’t require approval from anyone. If friends or family can’t be supportive, gently tell them that “I can’t be in an unsupportive environment right now” and get as much space as you can depending on your situation.If you can't get space, just remind yourself in their presence that you are not seeking approval. Or, ask a sibling or friend to come along to family gatherings who can serve as a source of support.

, As you start to realize who’s supportive and who’s not, make an effort to foster those relationships that serve you. If you have a friend or family member who is particularly supportive or who rushes to defend you from harsh comments, show your appreciation for this person. Count on them for support as you come to learn self-acceptance.Show appreciation by letting the person know how much you value him or her. Say something like ""Sometimes, the family can get me down when they mention my weight. Thanks for standing up for me back there. You didn't have to, but I'm grateful that you did.""

, Research shows that when overweight women see media stories about obese people being lazy, they are more likely to eat emotionally.As you can see, paying attention to media depictions of body weight or body size can only worsen your situation.


Challenge yourself to reduce exposure to media messages as much as possible. When you are exposed to TV shows or magazines that show human bodies in unrealistic proportions, view these images with skepticism.

Eat everything in moderation.",How to Quit Sugar As a Family," When you start talking about quitting sugar together as a family, you'll find that you'll need to decide whether or not to give it up cold turkey or slowly taper off over time.


The benefit of giving up sugar cold turkey is that in just a few days you can get rid of all the sweets and other tempting foods from your house. You'll have a fresh start.
Tapering can also be beneficial. You can slowly make a behavior change that might be easier to sustain long-term.
Everyone in your family might have a different opinion on this subject. Some people may find it easier to give it up cold turkey, while others need time to taper it off.
To help everyone get on the same page, allow everyone to voice their opinions and make a case for one or the other.
It'll be best if everyone can agree. That way, everyone is on the same page and can work together as a unit.;
, You're already destined to fare better on a no or low-sugar diet if you're doing it with your family. Make some no-sugar pacts and goals together so you can all stay on track.


When your whole family is on board with a sugar-free diet, you're likely to be successful because you have their support.Make a pact that no one brings any sugary sweets or foods into the house. If someone does want to have a treat, set a rule that it should be eaten away from the home.

Set goals together. See how long your entire family can go sugar-free. Create a calendar and set up rewards along the way.
For example, after a whole week without sugar, take everyone to the movies. Or after a whole month of no sugar, take everyone to a favorite sporting event (like a baseball game).

, After making goals and setting family guidelines, work together to make your house free of sugar as well. Creating a sugar-free environment can make following your goals easier.


If you still have sweet treats, sweetened beverages or other sugary foods still in your house, it can be difficult to stay on track with your goals.For example, you might have a bad day or an intense craving. It's on those days that those tempting sweets can become a serious problem.
Instead of keeping these foods around, try to prevent some of these slip-ups by cleaning out your pantry, refrigerator and freezer. Have everyone in the family tackle a different area and get rid of those sugary items.
Donate, fresh or unopened products to a food bank and toss or giveaway opened items to family or friends.

, If you and your family do enjoy the occasional sweet, don't think you have to give them up completely. Instead, make lower sugar versions from scratch.


Making foods from scratch is not only a good way to decrease sugar, but a great way to get the whole family involved.If your family has some top favorites, have everyone research recipes or come up with ideas on how to make these at home with less sugar.
You can even make this a fun challenge. For example, have everyone come up with their own, creative sugar-free or low-sugar dessert and choose a winner.
Work together to choose different foods to recreate at home. Everyone can select something different to work on each week.

, To help prevent sugary items from coming back into your house, you'll need to rethink the way you shop. Changing what you buy will help keep you on track.


Although you may enjoy making sweets at home, many sugary items are brought into the house after a grocery store trip.
A good place to start is before you go shopping. Review your typical grocery list and star items that normally have some added sugar or circle items where you need to check the label.
Take your time at the grocery store. Spend a little more time looking at labels, ingredient lists and the nutrition fact panel.
In addition, try to stay out of tempting aisle. The candy aisle, bakery section or ice cream aisle are full of sweet treats. Instead of tempting yourself, skip these sections completely — out of sight, out of mind., One of the best parts about giving up sugar as a family is that you automatically have a support group with you. Work to maintain your support group through tougher times.


Every needs support when it comes to making any type of dietary or lifestyle changes.Giving up sugar is no different. In fact, because sugar is so prevalent in your diet, a support group is essential.
You will have each other to lean on when a craving hits. Be mindful and wary when you see another family member struggling. Ask how you can be more supportive. Or ask how you can help them manage their cravings more appropriately.
Keep an eye out for family members (including yourself) that are enablers. These people make it ""OK"" to slip up a little too frequently even though they're still trying to support you.

, You will need to decide whether or not you're avoiding all sugars (both natural and added) or if you just want to avoid added sugars.


Natural sugars are common in a variety of foods that are still considered very nutritious and a healthful addition to your diet.For example, whole fruit, dairy and even some vegetables contain natural forms of sugar.
Although they do contain sugar, it's a natural form and generally comes with other additional nutrients. For example, dairy has protein and fruit has fiber.
If you look at dairy products, 100% fruit products (like fruit juice or applesauce) and some vegetable products, you may see on the nutrition label that there is sugar. If you're only avoiding added sugars, having some natural sugar is acceptable.

, Giving up sugar can be complicated. This is especially true if you're not reading food labels or you don't know how to read them. The nutrition fact panel is an essential component of the food label that's available on products. Make sure to spend time reviewing this the next time you're at the grocery store.


To read the nutrition label, you first need to identify the serving size. This is listed at the top of the label near ""total calories"" and ""Nutrition Facts.""Keep the serving size in mind when looking at the other information. In addition, consider whether or not you'll eat just one serving. If you eat more than one, you'll need to double or triple the other values on the label.
To find the total sugar, scan further down the label. ""Total Sugars"" is listed under the bold heading ""Total Carbohydrates"" on the label.
The sugar amount listed here is the total in one serving of the food. This doesn't distinguish whether or not the sugar is coming from an added or natural source. You'll need to review the ingredient list to figure this out.
In the future (starting July 2018), the food label will distinguish between added and natural sugars. Soon you'll be able to see the total grams of added sugar and total grams of natural sugars., In addition the nutrition fact panel, you'll need to review the ingredient list. Many times knowing the total sugar content isn't enough information when making a decision to eat a food.


The ingredient list is another component of the nutrition information that's required to be present on food items. It's typically listed underneath or next to the nutrition fact panel.Ingredient lists will reveal all the ingredients present in a product. The ingredients are listed in order from the highest to lowest quantity.
Review every ingredient listed here. This is where you will be able to tell whether or not there is added sugar in the product. Note that the exact amount of added vs. natural sugar is not listed on food labels at this time.

, Once you review the ingredient list, you may notice there are a lot of names or items that you don't recognize. Although this generally isn't a big deal, you do need to become aware of all the different names of added sugars.They can include names like:


Anhydrous dextrose
Brown sugar or white sugar
Corn syrup, corn syrup solids or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
Dextrose
Fructose
Honey, agave syrup or maple syrup
Invert sugar
Lactose
Malt syrup, cane juice or brown rice syrup
Maltose
Nectars (e.g., peach nectar, pear nectar) or fruit juice concentrates
Raw sugar, organic sugar or cane sugar
Sucrose

, Reading nutrition labels and taking your time while you shop will help you reduce how much sugar you're consuming. In addition to this, try to avoid the most obvious sources of sugars like:


Ice cream, cake, cookies and pies
Sweetened cereals, granola, granola bars or pastries
Sweetened beverages like regular soda, sweet tea, fruit juice cocktails or lemonade
Fruits with added sugars — like dried fruit, sweetened applesauce or canned fruit in syrup
Milk beverages, yogurt drinks or yogurt cups that have additional flavorings (like peach yogurt, chocolate milk or raspberry kefir)
Alcoholic beverages — especially those mixed with fruit juice or soda
Low-fat or fat-free items — like ranch dressing, peanut butter or barbecue sauce

, If you enjoy a little sweetness every now and again, try replacing that craving with a nutritious item. Fruit is a great naturally sweet food that can help tame a pesky sweet tooth.


Fruits are naturally low in calories but are also high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.Fruit does contain some natural sugars; however, health professionals generally consider this type of sugar appropriate to include in your diet.
You can also choose 100% fruit juice or unsweetened dried fruit. Both have no added sugar and can add in a touch of sweetness.
Try ending dinner with a small piece of fruit or a fruit cup. Or if you're craving a sweet in the afternoon grab a small handful of unsweetened dried fruit.

, Another food group that can help curb your sweet cravings is the dairy group. Including some of these foods can also help you cut out added sugar from your diet.


Like fruit, some dairy products are naturally sweet. They do contain a form of natural sugar (lactose) but in general, the overall sugar content is low.
In addition, most dairy foods contain a decent amount of protein, calcium, vitamin D and potassium.Great items to try include: a small yogurt or kefir drink. After dinner, have a bowl of yogurt topped with fruit or sip on kefir during the day.

, If you've been making foods from scratch and working to decrease your sugar intake, you might be interested in occasionally using a more natural sweetener. This can help you enjoy slightly more nutritious items.


Many sugary items contain a lot of very highly processed forms of sugar — like white sugar, corn syrup or corn syrup solids.
Instead, try making your own items from scratch using more natural and minimally processed sweeteners.
You can try items like: honey, agave syrup, molasses or maple syrup. These types of sweeteners have the same sugar content, but do have more antioxidants than processed sweeteners., If your goal is to cut out sugar completely, you may soon realize that many sugar-free items contain artificial or no-calorie sweeteners. Be aware of how much of these you're consuming and side effects they may produce.Getting rid of sugar in your diet can help you improve your diet and health in many ways.
Note that many sugar-free or low-sugar products use artificial sweeteners to help keep their sweet taste without the added sugar and calories.
When reading the food label, look out for artificial sweeteners like: stevia, erythritol, aspartame, sucralose, sorbitol, mannitol, saccharin or neotame.
No studies have proven adverse side effects to the use of artificial sweeteners. However, you may still want to avoid or limit them in your diet. Some people do report some side effects like: migraines, stomach upset and diarrhea.

, Giving up sugar completely is a difficult goal, but a beneficial one. If giving up sugar completely isn't right for you or your family, consider adding some sweet treats back in moderation.


If you want to continue to eat some of your favorite treats occasionally, you need to set a strict guideline or rule for you or your family of what moderation actually is.
For example, does the family go out two times a month for dessert together? Do you split dessert once a week? Or do you include a sugar-free treat more regularly?
Make sure that everyone is on board with the definition of moderation and can keep track of it long-term.

Eat probiotic yogurt to introduce healthy bacteria into your digestive system.,
Eat low-fiber fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid drinking alcohol to promote healthy digestion.,
Drink liberal amounts of fluids to stay hydrated.,
Take vitamin B12 supplements to recover lost nutrients.,
Use vitamin D to normalize your digestion.,
Make sure your levels of folic acid and iron are sufficient to ensure healthy blood cell generation.",How to Prevent Crohn's Disease1," Eating probiotic yogurt can help mitigate Crohn’s disease, by introducing healthy bacteria that help regulate your digestive tract.


These probiotics, such as Acidophilus and Bifidus, are species of good bacteria that fight against inflammation, as well as aid in the faster recovery in the parts of your intestines affected by Crohn's.
However, if you are lactose intolerant, be careful when considering a regimen of probiotic yogurt.
Problems with lactose intolerance can be corrected by choosing lactose free yogurt variants, as well as taking lactase, an enzyme that helps the gut digest lactose.
A recommended serving of yogurt is 1 serving or 1 cup of yogurt a day for patients with Crohn’s disease.
Although plain yogurt can suffice, it is best to choose a probiotic yogurt that is specifically made to include higher concentrations of good bacteria.
A good probiotic yogurt usually contains at least 5 – 10 billion specimens of good bacteria, as indicated in the nutrition facts.;
, Although many fruits and vegetables are known to trigger the symptoms of Crohn’s disease, some fruits and vegetables may provide a degree of relief.Eat fruit that contains less fiber and is easier to digest, in order to mitigate the symptoms of Crohn's disease.
Try bananas and peeled apples. These fruits also contain antioxidants that can help fight the inflammation in your intestines and reduce any cramping pain.
Eat vegetables that are soft and non-irritating, such as cooked carrots and steamed potatoes.
These foods are soft to eat and so they are less irritating to our digestive system. They have less fiber than leafy vegetables and are less likely to worsen the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.
These fruits and vegetables also contain antioxidants that reduce pain and inflammation caused by Crohn’s disease., Among its other negative health effects, drinking alcohol has a depressive effect on the digestive system.This depressive effect causes food and waste to remain in your digestive system longer than it should, eventually leading to inflammation.
In the worst case scenario, this slow digestion can cause an infection in your intestines.

, Drinking water consistently throughout the day is essential to fight against the dehydration that commonly results from the frequent diarrhea associated with Crohn's disease.Fluid intake also fights against constipation, and can help you have more comfortable bowel movements.
In addition to water, fluids such as fruit juices, soup broth, or vegetable soup contain essential vitamins, electrolytes, and nutrients that are especially necessary when you are suffering from Crohn’s disease.
Drink a total of at least 10 glasses, or 2.5 liters (0.7 US gal) of fluids per day to keep yourself hydrated.

, Crohn's disease often prevents you from eating the types of vegetables that contain vitamin B12, so it is important to supplement your intake of vitamins with a supplement.


Vitamin B12 is important for the proper formation of blood cells, as well as the normal functioning of nerves.
Try supplementing your diet by taking 1 capsule of vitamin B complex, containing 100 micrograms, once per day.

, Vitamin D deficiency can lead to Crohn’s disease, or worsen its symptoms if you already suffer from it. Make sure to take in the proper amount of vitamin D in order to avoid the symptoms of deficiency.


Vitamin D serves as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, acting to normalize the functioning of your digestive system.
The best source of vitamin D is exposing yourself to sunlight for at least 15 minutes a day, because sun exposure catalyzes the synthesis of vitamin D in your body.
Vitamin D supplements are also available, the suggested dosage being at least 1 gel capsule of 1000 IU per day., Folic acid and iron are essential to the production of healthy blood cells, which are needed to distribute adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients to other organs in the body.


Because you may be avoiding cruciferous vegetables and nuts, due to symptoms of Crohn's, you may be suffering from folic acid and iron deficiency.
Take an an iron and folic acid supplements equivalent to 60 mg of iron and 400 micrograms of folic acid in a tablet, at least once a day.

Undergo acupuncture to promote the release of endorphins.,
Try biofeedback.,
Use turmeric alone and in cooking to prevent the onset of Crohn's symptoms.",How to Prevent Crohn's Disease2," During acupuncture, a trained professional inserts needles into key anatomical areas to promote the release of endorphins, your body's natural pain killers.


This aims to prevent pain and inflammation in the digestive system.
By stimulating the body’s natural healing processes and defenses, acupuncture boosts your body’s ability to fight inflammation and prevent symptoms of Crohn’s disease.
Two pressure points specific to Crohn’s disease can be targeted.

The first would be ST 25 acupuncture point, which is located in the middle right side of the abdominal area.
The second is the ST 37 acupuncture point, which is one finger width below the anterior border of the tibia bone in the lower leg.



, Biofeedback is a method of analyzing and responding to immune disorders through the usage of electrodes that measure electrical impulses in the body.


Crohn’s disease is sometimes triggered by an overly sensitive immune system, meaning that biofeedback could be an effective method for controlling the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.
During biofeedback, your body will be attached to electrodes that analyze the body’s responses to specific electrical signals.
This information is used by the doctor to adjust the frequency and intensity of the electrical signals during future treatments.
The machine then converts these signals to cue the body towards a better reaction and response in regards to the abnormalities it is currently experiencing.
The frequency of the sessions depends on the opinion of your physician., Turmeric is a spice that is thought to reduce inflammation, and can be used in a variety of recipes or eaten alone.


Including turmeric in your diet could prevent Crohn's symptoms, due to its strong anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.
The usual therapeutic dosage of turmeric is 1 to 2 grams per day. Eating food with curry, such as one serving of chicken curry or curry rice, is enough to satisfy your daily intake of turmeric.

Monitor the types and amounts of food you consume.,
Only eat at meal times.,
Take care in consuming dairy products.,
Avoid coffee and other caffeinated drinks.,
Cut down on high-fiber foods.",How to Poop Less Often1," Often times, frequent trips to the bathroom can be indicative of a food allergy or intolerance. Keep a food diary. Write down everything you eat and what time you eat it. When you have a bowel movement, chart this in your diary as well. Eventually, a pattern may emerge. For example, perhaps every time you eat spicy food, you have an increased number of bowel movements.;
, Snacking can add to the amount of poop you will need to get rid of from your body, and also increases the regularity and continuity with which stool progresses to its exit. If you must eat, eat moderately.

, Lactose intolerance is a common condition found in adults. People who are lactose intolerant cannot break down the lactose sugar found in dairy products. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea. You may be able to keep eating cheese. Some people with lactose intolerance can still tolerate cheese, as many varieties have low amounts of lactose. Generally, the more aged the cheese is, the less lactose it contains.
Check the label of dairy products. Lactose is a type of sugar, so the less sugar a dairy product has, the less lactose it will likely contain.

, Caffeine stimulates the muscles that are responsible for producing stool. Try replacing caffeinated drinks with water, juice, or tea.
Try cutting down on the number of caffeinated drinks you consume each day. For example, cut down from 4 cups of coffee to 2 cups of coffee per day. Alternatively, try “half-caf” coffee, which has half the caffeine of a standard cup of coffee.

, Consuming an excess of foods with high fiber content can increase the frequency of bowel movements. If you're eating an excessive amount of fruits and vegetables, which contain high amounts of fiber, you may want to cut back. The Centers for Disease Control recommends 2.5-3 cups of vegetables today for adults who exercise less than 30 minutes per day. Those who exercise heavily may consume more vegetables. Foods that are high in fiber include: Raspberries
Pears
Apples
Spaghetti
Barley
Bran flakes
Oatmeal
Split peas
Lentils
Beans
Artichoke
Green peas
Broccoli

Drink a higher amount of water throughout the day.,
Increase your intake of healthy whole foods.,
Lower your intake of foods that are fried or high in fat and sugar.,
Consume the daily recommended amount of vitamins and minerals.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Get the needed amount of sleep on a nightly basis.,
Eliminate stressors from your life, and learn to manage stress more effectively.,
Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge.,
Stick to an eating schedule, and avoid skipping meals.,
Talk to your healthcare provider about medical treatments that can help you poop more often.",How to Poop More," Water helps waste move through your body at a normal, healthy pace, and can help keep your colon hydrated while also lowering the risk for constipation. In most cases, increasing your daily water intake can lead to more frequent bowel movements. Aim to drink an average of between a half-ounce to one ounce of water for every pound you weigh. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, drink between 100 to 200 ounces of water per day., Whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and lean protein are loaded with vitamins and minerals -- such as fiber -- that naturally help move waste through your body and contribute to regular bowel movements. Work with a nutritionist or dietitian if you need guidance on how to incorporate more of these foods into your diet., Foods high in sugar and fat lack the vitamins and minerals your body needs to help waste travel efficiently through your system, and can increase the risk for constipation and less frequent bowel movements. Eat fried foods and sweets in moderation, and drastically lower your intake of these foods to poop more often., Most commercial brands of multivitamins and the foods you eat on a daily basis often fail to provide your body with the daily recommended amount of vitamins and minerals, even if you stick to eating a diet comprised mainly of healthy whole foods. Consult with your healthcare provider for recommendations on nutritional supplements that can help you meet the daily recommended vitamin intake and allow you to experience more frequent bowel movements. Vitamin A, vitamin D, and healthy fats are examples of the nutrients your body needs to experience regular bowel movements., Exercise naturally helps stimulate more frequent, regular bowel movements by increasing your heart rate and breathing, and causing your intestinal muscles to contract. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week, plus strength-training exercises that work all major muscle groups two or three days per week., Lack of sleep puts your body under physical stress, which results in hormonal imbalance and affects your body’s ability to experience regular bowel movements. Start going to bed earlier, and aim to get an average of eight hours of sleep per night or as much as needed to help your body feel relaxed and well-rested. As soon as you establish a regular sleeping schedule, your body will naturally begin to experience more frequent bowel movements.

, Stress causes your entire body to tense up, including your bowels, and increases the risk for constipation. Work on eliminating stressors from your life, and practice effective stress-relief techniques that can help you relax on a consistent basis. Exercise and deep breathing are examples of behaviors that can naturally help relieve stress. You can also eliminate stress by engaging in activities that make you feel relaxed, such as soaking in a warm, relaxing bath or watching your favorite movie or television show., Holding in poop and suppressing the urge to have a bowel movement causes your stools to become dehydrated in your colon, which can lead to constipation and less frequent bowel movements. Visit a restroom as soon as you feel the urge to poop to help maintain healthy bowels and regular bowel movements.

, The more regular your diet, the more frequently you’ll experience bowel movements. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, and snack on healthy foods in between meals when your body feels hungry. Skipping meals can lead to physical stress and dehydration, and can increase your risk for constipation.

, Your physician can perform a medical evaluation, and recommend over-the-counter or prescription treatments that can help you experience more frequent bowel movements.

Destress.",How to Prevent Obesity," With each food pyramid that the USDA comes up with, fruits and vegetables (mostly vegetables) keep getting more and more emphasized. Your diet should consist mostly of the colorful stuff, along with lean protein and dairy. If all of your meals have fruit and/or vegetables (potatoes don't count!) as a main contender, you're doing it right.


When it comes to nature's delicious gifts, the leafier and more colorful, the better. Potatoes and other starchy vegetables aren't nearly as good for and are loaded up with carbs -- and are made worse when they're fried in oil or slathered in butter. Make it a point to eat the entire rainbow every day.;
, Protein is also an essential part of our diets. It builds and strengthens your muscles and keeps your appetite suppressed -- which means you won't be reaching for that late night Death by Chocolate, ruining the efforts you've made all day.


And as for dairy, eat a normal amount. It's a good source of calcium.Don't overdo it, though. Those dairy-is-super-important messages you've been hearing are more indicative of the power of the dairy industry than anything; there's actually little correlation between osteoporosis and the like and significant correlation between high dairy consumption and prostate and ovarian cancer.Don't be afraid of the saturated fats. These fats, which were previously thought to be bad for you aren't actually bad.In fact, low-fat products can contain added sugars.One acceptable low-fat dairy product is greek yogurt which is high in protein.However, don't be afraid of the fat content in dairy.

, The benefits of water are practically endless. Your skin clears up, your organs get flushed out, toxins get rid of, you lose weight, and you feel more energized. And when you're drinking water, you're not drinking sugary, calorie-riffic drinks, hitting that temporary caffeine buzz and drinking empty calories. Win, win, win, win, win.


Research says that if you up your water intake by around a liter a day, the weight will start slowly coming off -- with no other effort.Men should drink around 3 liters (0.8 US gal) and women around 2., If there's one reason the obesity epidemic is, indeed, an epidemic, it's because of the fact that packaged, refined grains are some of the most easily accessibly foods on the planet. You can grab that cookie, piece of Wonderbread, or bag of chips and walk out the door. Sure, it's convenient now -- but it wreaks havoc later.


The more and more processed something is, the fewer nutrients it has. And the whiter it is, too -- all the color has been taken out. So if it comes in a package or if it's as white as a poodle on Christmas morning, put it down. It's just simple sugars that are gonna spike your insulin and lead to excess fat storage.

, It's not that certain foods need to be avoided per se; it's that they need to be avoided in excess. And, unfortunately, we live in a society that wants everything supersized. If you weigh your food, you'll be able to see just what an appropriate size is. For example, a 3-ounce serving of meat is just the size of a deck of cards. How often do you go to your favorite restaurant and it takes up the entire plate?!


Weighing your food can be a pain in the rear -- so knock it all out at once! Take your favorite healthy snack -- nuts, dried fruit, etc. -- and package up some portion-controlled bites for the entire week. Then on your way out the door you can grab that snack and know you won't ruin your entire day by what was a healthy snack turning into absent-mindedly finishing that jar of peanuts.

, On the outside, it seems like a quick way to cut calories. And while in the morning you'll be in a calorie deficit, research shows that you'll more than make up for it later, scarfing down a much bigger lunch. What's more, you'll be sluggish the entire morning, looking for that energy come lunchtime. Make an effort to squeeze in time for a decent breakfast.


And ""decent"" here does not mean 4 donuts and a vanilla Frappuccino™. If only. In fact, foods like that can leave you hankering for real food, resulting in you just eating more. Instead, go for protein to fill you up -- egg (whites), lean meat, oatmeal, and a bit of peanut butter or a banana.

, It's hard enough to control what we keep in our own kitchens, but being at the will of the cafeteria at work or school makes things infinitely more difficult. If you can, bring your own food from home. For 5 minutes in the morning, you won't feel the afternoon sugar crash of your traditional Tuesday Snickers and Mountain Dew luncheon.


If at all possible, get involved in your work or school's health program. Do they offer healthy, mindful alternatives in the cafeteria? Do they encourage physical activity? If not, tell them to get on it! Their employees or students will be healthier, happier, and -- in their interest -- take fewer sick days, require fewer expenses, and workplace morale will skyrocket. What's not to like?

, The average American spends 34 hours a week watching TV, and that's not even including in front of your phone, tablet or computer. You know what you're doing when you're in front of a screen? Not moving and being productive, that's for sure!


Start by cutting out just 30 minutes of TV or computer usage every day. See the things you can get done! You might actually be happier, too.Not only will you not be sitting down, lazily, comparing your life to the amazing ones you see on Facebook, but you'll be getting up and getting stuff done. Even if it's just doing the laundry, it's something!

, Let's not beat around the bush because it's about the farthest thing away from rocket science: exercise is good for you, helps keep the weight off, and can improve your mood. Ideally you want to get around 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day, but whatever you're capable of is a step in the right direction.


You don't have to sign up for the gym or go buy running shoes and start saving up for your inevitable knee replacement. Make exercise a part of your lifestyle instead of something you have to go out of your way to do. Take hikes, go swimming, sign up for a league. When exercise isn't work, it's enjoyable and you do more of it. There's no reason you can't keep it fun and natural.

, When you start out on the wrong path at an early age, it's infinitely harder to get back on the right track. So start your children out right! Making sure they make good decisions will help you make your own good decisions, too. Here are some basics:


Be a good role model. If your children see you scarfing a bag of Fritos, they'll do the same. Show them that eating healthily is just a normal, everyday thing. If you don't want the Fritos, they'll be less inclined to want the Fritos, too.
Be encouraging. That is, encourage physical activity, drinking water, and eating only when they're hungry. Offer to do active things with them or get them a glass of water when you're thirsty. Eat meals together so they're not eating alone (and more often). But don't use bad foods as a reward -- they'll make the association that they're more desirable.
For babies, breastfeed six months or longer. Studies show that children who are breastfed for this amount of time are 20-40% less likely to be overweight.That's a pretty staggering statistic.

, If it's at all possible for your lifestyle, keep the car in the garage. Not only will you be saving the environment, you'll be getting to point B the healthiest way you can. Riding your bike or walking to wherever you need to go gets you out in the fresh air, burning calories, and still gets you where you need to be.

, This is pretty much the most perfect diet ever: sleep more, lose weight. It's not only because when we're sleeping we're not eating, it's because sleep regulates the hormones leptin and ghrelin.This is basically code for sleep keeping you from being hungry and allowing you to feel full. Amazing!


Have you ever pulled an all-nighter and the next day, whatever you do, you cannot drink enough coffee, eat enough pizza, or just get going? That's leptin and ghrelin at work. Your hormones are all sorts of off-kilter.

, To prevent lifelong obesity, partaking in diets or current trends isn't going get you the long term results you're looking for. Being healthy has to be a way of life -- no options, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It just has to be how you live. So instead of focusing on that number on the scale, focus on your habits. The rest will then fall into place.


That being said, do weigh yourself once in a while. Studies show that being aware of your weight leads to better, healthier decisions. And you'll know what works and what doesn't.No surprises there!

, Unfortunately, some people are just more predisposed to being heavy. Others have conditions (thyroid, namely) that guarantee a hefty number on the scale for the rest of their lives. There's metabolism and genes and a whole cacophony of weight-fighting battles that make everything more difficult than it already is. If it's an intense struggle for you, some other force could be at play.


If you eat right and exercise and the weight still isn't coming off, go to your doctor. Your health is at stake here! You may be able to start a medication that can normalize your hormones and get you going on the right path. You may also find out about a condition you have that you weren't aware of, ultimately saving your life. Never leave your health up to chance!

, We all have them. 10 pm hits and we want that pizza, we're stress-eating because of work or a relationship, or we're super tired in the morning and pound that full-fat latte. What's your fix? Your guilty pleasures? What beats down on your self-control until you can't not cave to the temptations? If you know what gets your appetite out of control, you can avoid it. What are your food traps?


The most common food traps are eating when we're bored or stressed. If you can be mindful of when you're eating and why, that's half the battle. If you know this is an issue for you, why not start keeping a food journal?

, In other words, don't stock the candies, refined grains, and other villains in the house. When they're not there, you won't eat them! You'll be forced to eat what you have available -- and you'll start craving what's there. Remove the temptation and you remove the bad choices.


Don't just stick to good foods. You want to think of the drinks, too. All too often we drink away those calories, not realizing that it counts just as much as food, even though we're not full. Keep the soda to a minimum and concentrate on water and tea.

, In other words, make every day a chance to find small opportunities to live healthier. Take the stairs. Park far away. Wash your own car. Remodel the kitchen yourself. Take your work lunch for a walk. 5 minutes here and there can really make the difference!


And once you get used to staying ""active"" on a normal basis, that urge to feel lazy will go away. You'll no longer groan at the idea of tending the garden or organizing your shelves. Getting up and getting things done is just par for your healthy, lively course.

, This packs a powerful punch: not only will you be saving money, but you'll be saving calories, portion sizes, and knowing exactly what goes into every bite. You'll also be removing temptation from ordering that drink, appetizer, and dessert. And did we mention the whole being-able-to-cook thing?


Arm yourself with a dozen or so healthy recipes. When cooking healthy is easy and delicious, you'll find that you make no excuses to do it. You'll be able to bang out dinner in no time flat and you'll be honing your skills!

, Not only will it make you happier and more content with your life if you're relaxed, but you'll have more control over your health, too. Higher cortisol levels knock the rest of your hormones off balance and it all leads to making poorer life choices. Feeling lazy, exercising less, and opting for Chinese take-out over cooking a healthy dinner, to name a few. Take this as an excuse to have ""me"" time!


If you haven't gotten on the meditation or yoga bandwagon, give one or both a try. Just 15 minutes a day can make the other 1425 minutes in your day infinitely better.

If diarrhea or any changes in bowel frequency are listed as possible side effects, consult your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms.


Adderall has diarrhea listed as a side effect.
Metformin, a common medication for diabetes, also cause significant diarrhea. Check with your doctor if you are having significant GI symptoms while on metformin.
Other common medications can cause diarrhea, including misoprostol, laxatives, and stool softeners. , Alcohol can also cause diarrhea and may exacerbate bowel-related medical conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). , Stress may contribute to increased bowel movement frequency and can cause diarrhea. People often feel anxious about relationships, finances, education exams, or other big life events.


Avoid the stressors you are able to avoid. This can include changing your plans to avoid areas of high traffic, or avoiding a particularly difficult coworker.
Treat your time as valuable. Learn to say no when someone asks you to help with a last-minute deadline or other activity that you really just don’t have time for.
Communicate with respect. If your neighbor is running a basketball tournament out of their house and creating a traffic snarl in your neighborhood, politely ask the person to change their behavior. Perhaps they could encourage parents to carpool or park farther away.
Be up front about how much time you can allocate to a project, conversation, or other activity. For example, if your coworker rushes up to you just as you’re about to leave for a meeting, politely tell them that you only have 5 minutes to listen.
Forgive and move forward. Staying angry and holding a grudge takes energy – your energy. Talk with the person who has wronged you and honestly express your feelings. Know that their answer may or may not be what you want to hear. Sometimes shrugging your shoulders and moving on is the best thing you can do for you.
Be adaptable and flexible. As important as it is to have a plan for many things, life always throws us curveballs. Ask yourself if having a pristine house is truly important, or if simply having a clean house is acceptable to you. Evaluate whether or not the thing that is bothering you will really matter a year or five years from now.

Understand the requirements of a religious fast.,
Research the requirements of a dietary fast.,
Visit your doctor.,
Make any necessary work arrangements.,
Plan your meals ahead of time.",How to Prepare Your Body for a Fast1," Before you begin your faith-based fast, it is important to understand what the dietary and time requirements are. Many religious fasts have specific dietary guidelines and limitations on when you can eat. Know how long the fast will last and investigate its requirements. Depending on the fast, you may be allowed to consume certain foods or eat at specific times of the day.


For example, during Ramadan, Muslims are required to fast from dawn until sunset.During Yom Kippur, Jews fast for nearly twenty-six hours.;
, There are many different types of fasts designed to help you lose weight and get healthy, which is not always true. If the fast sounds too good to be true, it probably is. These include various kinds of juice fasts, cleansing fasts and water fasts. Much like the religious fasts, these different dietary fasts have varying lengths of time and fasting requirements. Be sure to understand what is expected of your before you begin., Once you understand the requirements of your fast, you should visit your doctor to make sure that you are physically healthy enough to participate. A chronic or severe medical condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, may prevent you from fasting. You should also consult your doctor if you are pregnant or nursing and considering a fast.Most faith-based fasts tend to have health related exemptions if you are unable to participate.

, Depending on the length and intensity of your fast, you may need to make special work arrangements. During the fast, you may get fatigued easily and require frequent rest. If the fast is going to last multiple days, you may want to inform your supervisor and coworkers that you are fasting and explain to them that the quality of your work may be impacted.


If you work involves physical labor, you may need to take a leave during your fast.

, If you can consume certain foods or eat at certain times, you might want to consider meal planning for the fast ahead of time. Do any grocery shopping before the fast while you still have plenty of energy. If you run out of something, a trip to the grocery store may be a tortuous exercise while fasting.


If you are participating in a juice fast, consider stocking up on the fruits and vegetables you will need before you begin.
For example, if you are participating in the Ramadan fast, consider purchasing your supplies for Suhoor (the predawn meal) and Iftar (the after sunset meal) ahead of time."
"
Drink lots of water.,
Ease into the fast.,
Eat healthy foods before fasting.",How to Prepare Your Body for a Fast2," Before you begin your fast, make sure that you are drinking plenty of water. Getting enough water is not only necessary to maintain your health, but it can also help curb your appetite.Men should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) and women should drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day.Drinking enough water will help you curb your cravings and ease into your fast.

, In the days or weeks before the fast, try gradually easing your way into it. If the fast will last for a few weeks, consider adopting an eating schedule where you only eat on designated days of the week.For shorter fasts, you may want to slowly cut back on how much you eat as you near the fasting period.Either way, if you begin limiting how much you eat before the fast, it will be much easier to maintain it once you begin.


Before you begin your fast, you should also stop snacking. This is also a good practice for controlling your hunger and it will help you practice restraint.
Avoid eating a large meal before your fast. This will momentarily enlarge your stomach and increase your appetite as you begin your fast., As you near your fast date, consider eating more whole foods and skipping processed items, particularly sugary foods. Eating foods high in sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which increases your appetite. If you are looking to curb your appetite going into your fast, try to eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These foods will keep your appetite steady and make it easier for you to begin your fast.


You may also want to consider eating lean meats and other proteins. Protein rich foods will help you stay satiated longer.Avoid high-fat foods, which can also increase your hunger.

"
"
Regulate your sleep.,
Limit any addictive or habitual substances.,
Take it easy.",How to Prepare Your Body for a Fast3," Try to maintain a normal and healthy sleep schedule going into the fast. Sleep deprivation spurs hunger, which can make things problematic in the weeks before your fast when you are trying to limit how much you eat. If you can maintain a proper sleep schedule, you should have an easier time controlling your cravings going into your fast.This is particularly important if you are fasting for Ramadan when your only opportunities to eat are early in the morning and late at night. Consider adjusting to these extreme meal times in advance., Depending on your fast, you may have to give up certain substances for an extended period of time. Abstaining from certain addictive substances might cause you to experience withdrawals, which will it harder for you to maintain your fast. In order to prevent withdrawals, try to ween yourself off of these addictive substances in advance of the fast.Some common addictive substances are caffeinated or sugary drinks, like coffee and soda, and tobacco products, like cigarettes and chewing tobacco.

, If you are easing your way into your fast, you may notice that you become fatigued more easily. Because you are limiting your caloric intake, your body is becoming more lethargic. During this period of low energy, you can easily overexert yourself and become ill or injured. In order to avoid these negative side-effects, be sure to relax and minimize any strenuous activity as you prepare for the fast.Try to avoid any strenuous exercise routines or physical labor.

Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat vitamin E-rich foods.,
Eat only 100% whole grain foods.,
Eat mangosteens.,
Add pomegranates to your diet.,
Eat more pineapple.,
Eat more tomatoes.,
Increase your intake of garlic and onions.,
Cook with herbs and spices.,
Sip on green tea.",How to Naturally Lower Prostaglandins with Food1," According to several studies, omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombogenic and anti-arrhythmic effects.Fish oil has also been found to reduce the production and effectiveness of several prostaglandins.


Omega-3 fatty acids compete with omega 6 fatty acids for the same binding site called the COX 1 enzyme. This enzyme converts omega 6 fatty acids to prostaglandin. The more omega 3 fatty acids blocking the COX 1 enzyme, the fewer omega 6 fatty acids will be converted to prostaglandins .
Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include: sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu and mackerel. The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is between 0.3 g -0.5 g daily.;
, There are a group of compounds that are known as Vitamin E and have been found to show antioxidant-like properties.This vitamin is also known as an anti-inflammatory because it has the ability to suppress or inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, thus lowering your prostaglandin levels.


Foods rich in Vitamin E include: Sunflower seeds and oil, almonds, safflower oil, hazelnuts, peanuts and peanut butter, spinach, broccoli or wheat germ oil., Studies show that whole grain foods have a variety of health benefits including the promotion of anti-inflammatory processes in the body.This means that whole grains indirectly lower your PG levels.


Whole grain products include: Barley, quinoa, oatmeal, whole wheat flour, brown rice and 100% whole wheat pasta or breads.Refined grains are overly processed and stripped of their valuable nutrients. Refined grains to minimize or avoid include: white bread, white pasta, white rice and many cereals.

, Mangosteens are a tropical fruit, native to Thailand, that have fragrant and sweet white flesh.It has been used medicinally in Thailand for years and recently according to studies, has been shown to inhibit the production or synthesis of prostaglandins in the body.You can consume mangosteen raw as a snack or a healthy dessert. You can also toss them into salads or make a jam from them., This fruit is a tasty, ruby red fruit that are filled with tiny little sweet and edible seeds. There have been a large variety of health benefits associated with pomegranates due to high concentrations of phytochemicals.According to studies, pomegranate may help to lower your levels of PG by inhibiting its production and synthesis.You can eat pomegranate seeds raw, use them in desserts or toss them into savory dishes like salads or sauces.
If you're not a fan of the seeds, try drinking 100% pomegranate juice. Do not purchase juice mixes, cocktails or juice concentrate.

, This bright yellow fruit contains an enzyme known as bromelain that has been shown to reduce levels of prostaglandins. It does this by inhibiting PG production and synthesis.Pineapple is the only food source of bromelain available.Eating raw pineapple as a snack, part of a fruit salad or on top of yogurt or cottage cheese is a great way to consume bromelain.

, This common vegetable contains high amounts of a carotenoid called lycopene. This is an antioxidant known for preventing prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease and reducing inflammation. It's thought to reduce inflammation by affecting chemical mediators in your body that are ultimately responsible for prostaglandin and other inflammatory mediator production. Cook tomatoes or use tomato products that have been cooked or processed with heat (like canned tomatoes or tomato paste). Cooking and heating tomatoes changes the type of lycopene into a form that's more easily absorbed by your body.You can eat stewed tomatoes, add tomato sauce to your pasta or vegetables. Add canned tomatoes to soups, stews and sauces.
Raw tomatoes can be thrown into salads or eaten with a drizzle of olive oil and salt.

, Both garlic and onion contain allicin, an active ingredient that works like anti-inflammatory medication blocking prostaglandin production.In addition, these foods have been shown to display antimicrobial, anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-arthritic properties.Increase the amount you cook with garlic and onions. This combination makes a great base for a variety of dishes including soups, stews, sauces in addition to braised dishes, casseroles or crock-pot meals.

, Many different herbs and spices have been show to have a variety of health benefits including anti-inflammatory properties. Using a wide range of fresh or dried herbs and spices can help you add these anti-inflammatory foods to your diet.


Use turmeric in your cooking. Turmeric is a bright yellow/orange root that is most commonly known as an ingredient in curry powder. It contains a compound called curcumin, which has been shown to inhibit the production of prostaglandins.In addition turmeric has been shown to aid in the reduction of pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis.You can purchase turmeric raw in it's root form or dried and ground into a spice powder. Try using turmeric powder in scrambled eggs, tossed with roasted vegetables, mixed with rice dishes, added to salads or salad dressing or even blend into smoothies.Many cultures also use turmeric to make a turmeric tea. Simmer turmeric root in boiling water for five minutes. Strain the tea and drink it three to four times a day.Add more ginger to your diet. Studies have shown that ginger displays anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties..
Use fresh ginger in sauces, marinades, stir-fries or curries. You can also steep fresh ginger in hot water to make homemade ginger tea.
Dried ginger works well in spice rubs, baked goods and sauces.

, According to studies, green tea can lower prostaglandin levels in your body.It is believed that the polyphenols in green tea have antioxidant properties that aid in reducing damage to cells from free radicals.


To make green tea, put one teaspoon of green tea leaves in 8 ounces of hot water. Do not mix green tea into boiling water because the helpful chemicals in the tea will be destroyed by the high temperatures.Add honey to your green tea. According to studies, honey can help to lower plasma prostaglandin concentrations. .

Avoid foods that are rich in iron.,
Stay hydrated.,
Know what drinks to avoid.,
Eat grapefruit every day.,
Get more anti-oxidants.,
Do activities gradually.,
Donate blood.,
Take mini aspirin.,
Stick to lower ground.,
Stop smoking.,
Treat the underlying cause.,
Monitor your headaches and dizziness.,
Talk to your doctor if you feel weak and fatigued.,
Monitor your breathing.,
Look for bruising.,
Feel odd sensations in your skin.",How to Lower Hematocrit Levels," Your body needs plenty of hemoglobin to create red blood cells. The easiest way for your body to get hemoglobin is iron. Since red blood cells are essentially what makes up your hematocrit level, avoid eating iron-rich foods, such as the following:Green leafy vegetables, like spinach and broccoli
Chicken, turkey, ham
Beef, veal
Fish, clams, mussels
Foods enriched with iron, like breakfast cereals

However, remember that if your hematocrit levels are low, it means that there isn’t enough oxygen in your cells to fully function. Your hematocrit level needs to be normal and stable, not low. Talk to your doctor about how stringently you should avoid iron – less serious cases need only reduce consumption.

;
, The effect of dehydration in your body will result in higher hematocrit levels, a higher whole blood volume, and higher plasma volume as there's less liquid in your body to dilute your blood. This means when you are severely dehydrated, your hematocrit level will be sky high; on the other hand, if you have a sufficient amount of water in your body, your hematocrit level will remain within normal.


Coconut water, unconcentrated juice drinks (like apple and pineapple juices), and sports drinks (like Gatorade or Powerade) are all great options.
Remember that drinking 8 to 12 glasses every day will do wonders for your body. Make it a habit to increase your fluid intake, especially if you are in the middle of doing something very strenuous.

, Drinking caffeine and alcoholic drinks are discouraged because both of them are diuretics. They stimulate urination and can cause dehydration even though you're consistently drinking. To keep your hematocrit levels low, skip the soda, wine, hard liquor, and beer, and stick to water or unsweetened juices.


By drinking more fluids, the concentration of the blood will be diluted because the body also stores fluid in our bloodstream, thus lowering the concentration level of the hematocrit. Aim for an intake of 2 liters (0.5 US gal) a day or more to keep a normal hematocrit level.

, Recent studies have shown that eating 1/2 to a whole grapefruit every day can lower your hematocrit levels.The higher your levels, the more effective grapefruit will be. Include a half with your breakfast and half the other half as a snack at midday.


This is because naringin, a flavonoid seen in high concentrations in grapefruit, can lead to phagocytosis, which is a process that naturally removes red blood cells from your blood, converting them into other uses.

, These help protect the body from free radicals which are thought to cause cancer and other blood related diseases. When you consume supplements or foods that are rich in anti-oxidants, transport of oxygen in your body is easier. Good sources of these are prunes, beans, and berries.


Anti-oxidants help in a number of ways, but the most important thing to note when it comes to lowering your hematocrit level is that it can help in providing oxygen to the blood so that it can properly circulate in your body. It does not only help in avoiding diseases but will also help in promoting good health.

, Again, this is all about the amount of oxygen needed for your body to fully function. Never allow yourself to become severely exhausted because it will only mean that the oxygen levels in your blood are being used up to the extremes. Take it one step at a time. If you feel faint or dizzy, stop immediately.


Take a break when you are out on a run or exercising in the gym. Never push yourself more than you know you're capable of. Keep this in mind for daily strenuous activities, too – it's easy to forget when you're out for a swim or a hike that the same principles apply.
Talk to your doctor about what he or she thinks is an appropriate exercise regimen for you. Every person is different; your level of fitness will determine how much exercise your body can handle.

, According to the NHS Blood and Transplant, the frequency of giving blood should be a maximum of 4 times a year or an interval of 12 weeks between blood donations. Only do this as a last result and only if you have consulted your physician. If he or she does approve of this measure here's why it's helpful:


This can cleanse your blood as your body tries to replenish the amount of blood that it has lost, making the circulating blood fresh.
This removes excess iron in your body. An excessive amount of iron is thought to be the cause of atherosclerosis or the hardening of your arteries. When you donate blood, about 250 mg of iron will be removed from your body cutting your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

, Again, only do this as a last resort because it can have other untoward effects. Make sure that you consult your doctor about taking aspirin as a means to lower your hematocrit levels because the only way for mini aspirin to help in lowering your hematocrit level is when it causes gastrointestinal bleeding.


Aspirin is an anti-platelet drug. Platelets help a lot when it comes to clotting in the event of an injury. When you take mini aspirin as a means to lower your hematocrit level, know that it can thin out your blood completely which can result to your blood's inability to clot, light headedness and other neurological deficits.

, Areas with high elevation have a lower oxygen concentration than areas with lower elevation. An area of more than 8,000 feet (2,438.4 m) above sea level is considered to have ”thinner oxygen."" People living in these areas generally have high hematocrit. Moving to a lower altitude residence will help return your hematocrit count to normal.


As an adaptation to the environment, the bone marrow which is responsible of producing RBCs produces more RBCs to compensate for the low oxygen level of the body and as a result, there is a high concentration level of hematocrit in the body.

, Nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products impairs the blood circulation by altering the oxygen carrying capacity of your red blood cells. The body compensates for the problem of having low oxygen levels by having the bone marrow produce more RBCs, thus increasing the level of hematocrit in your body. Stopping smoking or consuming any other tobacco product will help lower your hematocrit level.Quitting smoking is also best for your heart, lungs, skin, hair, and your entire body. Aside from that, it's also better for those around you. If doing it for your hematocrit isn't enough, do it for these reasons.

, Elevated hematocrit levels maybe related to a different disease entirely, namely variations in cancer and a potential tumor. Tumors and cancer – especially in the bone marrow – create an uncontrolled production of blood cells.Do not jump to any conclusions if you have a high hematocrit count. Consulting your doctor is the best way to know how to reduce your hematocrit level effectively and the only way to know why your hematocrit level is high.

, These two symptoms are the result of an excessive number of RBCs in the blood making the blood concentrated. As a signal and compensatory mechanism, headache and dizziness can result from high hematocrit levels.


Concentrated blood is viscous – meanings that it's thick and sticky and doesn't flow as well. In return, the delivery of oxygen to the brain is slightly decreased. A lack of oxygen in the brain can turn very serious quite quickly.

, This is an overall bodily response to viscous blood that has difficulty in delivering oxygen and nutrients to the entire body. If weakness is something you're feeling 24/7, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.


Fatigue can be a sign of any number of ailments, not just high hematocrit levels. To know what your fatigue is a symptom of, see your doctor. Only a medical professional can then point you on the right route.

, Those with high hematocrit counts often suffer from ""tachypnea."" This is just a medical term that refers to a fast breathing pattern of more than 20 cycles per minute. This is a short-term compensatory mechanism of the body in response to a poor delivery of oxygen.


Again, in isolation, this is not a symptom to worry about. Only if you find your breathing is hastened more often than not and for no good reason should this be cause for alarm.

, High hematocrit levels may cause bruising because of the concentrated blood flowing through your blood vessels. Concentrated, viscous blood is prone to blood clots all over the body. Bruising appears as a violet to black in color anywhere on the body. Some are painless and some are painful.


Bruising is a normal result of injury. The bruises that you should pay attention to – especially when considering hematocrit counts – are the bruises that seem to have no cause. If you have bruises that appear out of nowhere, these could be hematocritic bruises.

, A high hematocrit count can lead to a number of inexplicable things going on in your skin. The blood flowing right beneath your skin, when it lacks oxygen, can mess with the functioning of your sense receptors. Here's how:



Itching. Itching is caused by the histamine secreted by the body in reaction to a high hematocrit level. Histamine is a chemical messenger involved in inflammation and allergy. Itching occurs primarily on the distal part or extremities such as hands and feet.

Paresthesia. This is a condition of having a tingling, prickling or burning sensation on the soles of the hands and feet. This is primarily a result of poor blood circulation. A high hematocrit level makes the blood more viscous due to the concentration of RBCs in the blood plasma. This is also common in diabetic clients that have poor circulation.

Speak with your doctor.,
Write a meal plan.,
Prepare new recipes and meals.",How to Naturally Lower Prostaglandins with Food2," Talk to your doctor prior to making any dietary changes or adding dietary supplements. This is especially true if you're trying to treat or manage a current health condition.


Talk to your doctor specifically about what foods you're planning on adding or removing from your diet, why you're changing your diet and how you think they'll benefit your health.
Also check with your doctor about appropriate dosages that will be safe and healthy for you.
While many of foods and supplements have shown a wide range of health benefits, they may interact with your current medications or health conditions in a negative way.

, A meal plan will be helpful when trying to add specific foods to your diet. It can help you see where you can incorporate a variety of anti-inflammatory foods throughout each day and week.


Start adding different foods slowly each week. It may be easier to maintain compared to forcing yourself to fit in a large quantity of new foods to your diet all at once.
Also try choosing foods that you can include everyday. It might be easy to include a hot mug of green tea every morning as a first step.
Remember, you don't have to include every anti-inflammatory food each day. Choose a variety to include over your entire week.

, Some anti-inflammatory foods, like ginger, garlic and onions, will be easier to include in your recipes. You can consume them raw, but it might not be as appetizing compared to incorporating them into recipes.


Many different cuisines regularly use foods and spices that have anti-inflammatory properties. Indian cuisine is known for it's use of turmeric, where as Italian cuisine features a lot of garlic.
Try researching different recipes online or check for cookbooks that feature recipes that focus on anti-inflammatory foods.

Limit your intake of unhealthy saturated fats.,
Limit alcoholic beverages.,
Limit added sugars.,
Decrease the amount of Omega-6 fats you consume.",How to Naturally Lower Prostaglandins with Food3," Saturated fats are used to synthesize prostaglandin in your body..


Foods that contain saturated fats include: processed meats (like sausage, hotdogs or bacon), fried foods, fast foods and whole-milk dairy products (like cheese or butter)., Stop or limit your intake of alcohol. High levels of alcohol have been shown to increase prostaglandin production.


Women should limit alcohol to 1 glass or less per day and men should limit alcohol to 2 glasses or less daily., Some studies have shown that added sugars trigger the release of certain chemicals that have inflammation-promoting properties.Limiting these foods, especially if you eat them on a regular basis, can decrease inflammation.


Foods to limit include: Limit foods like sweets, pastries, sweetened beverages and desserts that typically contain added sugars.

, These types of fats are key in the production of prostaglandins. Minimizing these types of fats may help decrease prostaglandin production.Omega-6 fats are found in foods like: corn oil, safflower oil, mayonnaise, dressings, soy oil, peanut oil and vegetable oil."

Decide to detox.,
Know when not to detox.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Be aware of the realities.,
Watch out for toxin spike.,
Find a detox buddy.",How to Make a Detox Juice1," Detoxification is often undertaken because people know their environment is filled with toxins and they want to help along the natural process. One common approach is to make detox juice. These juices use only natural, organic ingredients and are designed to help support the normal detoxification processes.


People often feel more focused and energetic after using detox juices. This is due to the ingredients in the juices as well as the removal of processed foods, fats, and sugars.;
, Fasting and detox should not be undertaken by anyone who has a fever, anyone with a life-threatening condition, or those with cancer, TB, or AIDS. Anyone with either Type I or Type II diabetes should only undertake supervised detox, though it is not recommended. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, young children, and those with kidney failure or liver disease should never detox.


Individuals taking any prescription medication should be supervised while detoxing. There may be unpredictable reactions., Before you begin, make sure you speak to your doctor to be sure that you don’t have a specific medical problem that may cause difficulty. In addition, if you plan to only drink these juices as part of a detoxification plan, make certain it is medically safe for you by talking to your physician. Follow any recommendations for which juice to use and for how long to use it. Your physician knows your medical history and can best advise you regarding potential negative effects.For many people, spending ½ to one day a week ingesting only a detox juice is safe, but be safe and check first.
Fasting for 12 to 24 hours is a very common practice that has been done for centuries in various cultures and religions, but it is not universally agreed that it is a safe practice. Most physicians would not recommend fasting for children or for pregnant or nursing women., None of the detox juice recipes have been tested for effectiveness or safety. Most of these recipes are passed around from person to person or through various books and articles.


Detoxing can cause muscle loss due to a lack of protein. Try adding a scoop of unflavored protein powder to your juice to prevent this.
There are no specific side effects because any side effects depend to a large extent on your overall state of health, how long you use the juices, and which juices you use. Each juice is different with varying levels of nutrients., When detoxing, don’t overdo it. Detoxing sounds like a great idea that everyone should be doing, but no one really knows how much of a toxic load each individual is carrying. Toxins are often stored in fat tissue and, as you fast, the body turns to stored fat for energy, thereby releasing the toxins. This can result in a sudden spike of toxins in the blood, which should resolve itself on it's own and should not be a long lasting effect.The potential effects of this can vary, but can include:


Fatigue
Confusion
Dizziness
Lightheadedness
Fainting
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Headaches
Low blood pressure
Abnormal heart rhythms

, Instead of detoxing alone, find a friend who fasts and detoxes on different days. This is so you will have someone to keep an eye on you. Given that the potential effects include confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, it makes sense to have someone to check in on you from time to time.

See your doctor.,
Submit to any diagnostic testing.,
Take an OTC medication to clear the infection.,
Ask your doctor about prescription medications.,
Change your underwear frequently.,
Refrain from sex.,
Finish a course of antibiotics.,
Evaluate other medications.,
Ask your doctor about a medication routine.",How to Treat Candida1," If you do not have a yeast infection but take over-the-counter (OTC) medications for one, then you can cause resistant candida to breed, making you more prone to infection later on. It is best to see your doctor first and allow her to perform a physical examination to determine if the infection is candida or something else.


Your doctor will likely begin with a vulvovaginal inspection to examine the area for a whitish discharge and redness around the area (erythema).While a man can technically get a genital yeast infection, they’re extremely rare. You should still begin by seeing your doctor to determine the cause of any genital abnormalities.;
, After the physical exam, your doctor may want to run a specific diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis. Common diagnostic tests include slides, cultures, and pH tests.If your doctor prepares a slide, then she’ll look for particular structures of yeast formation under a microscope.
A culture of the discharge will isolate it and determine the cause via lab work.
A pH test determines if the normal vaginal pH of four has been altered since candida usually results in a lower pH.

, OTC medication is available to clear up the infection. These anti-fungal creams, ointments, or tablets usually require between one- and three-day regimens to clear the infection. Always follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions for the medication. Common options include:Butoconazole (Gynazole-1)
Clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin)
Miconazole (Monistat 3)
Terconazole (Terazol 3)
Common side effects include minor burning or irritation., Your doctor will likely recommend an OTC option, but she may also prescribe you a medication, especially in complicated or recurrent cases.The oral anti-fungal medication fluconazole (Diflucan) is a common prescription options.Your doctor may also prescribe this in combination with a seven- to fourteen-day regimen of applying vaginal ointments or creams.

, Underwear provide a breeding ground for candida infections. During the course of the infection, stick to cotton underwear, which breathe more than other materials. You should also change your underwear every twenty-four hours or even more often if possible.Note that normal laundering in hot water has not always proven effective at sterilizing underwear with candida present in the fabric. Studies have shown that laundering the underwear and then microwaving the moist material for five minutes on high reduced the risk of prolonging or reintroducing the infection.Ensure that the material is microwave safe before trying. Laundering and then ironing the material is another option., Lubes, condoms, and even your partner's natural bacteria can make your infection worse or cause it to begin with. Refrain from sex, including oral sex, until you have cleared your infection., Many women develop a yeast infection due to taking antibiotics for a completely unrelated problem. By reducing the occurrence of naturally present bacteria, the antibiotics allow the candida to thrive.It is important to finish the course of antibiotics despite causing a test infection. Often the resurgence of the natural bacteria after finishing the antibiotics is all it takes to clear the yeast infection.

, In addition to antibiotics, certain other medications and conditions can cause or prolong yeast infections. High doses of estrogen from birth control pills or hormone therapy can lead to increases in yeast infections, for instance.Consult with your doctor about the best course or action for changing a medication that may be responsible for a yeast infection.

, For chronic or recurrent cases of genital candida infection, your doctor may prescribe a medication routine as opposed to a single course. This option may include taking a medication once a week for up to six months rather than over the course of only several days."

Drink at least six of these drinks during your detox day., For this juice, use only fresh, organic vegetables. The vegetables in this juice contain vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients. Put three carrots, two celery stalks, ½ a medium cabbage, two medium beets, one medium turnip, ½ a medium onion, and two cloves of garlic in a blender. Mix well, adding water to make it fluid. Once these are well combined, add three large kale leaves, one cup of spinach, and ½ a bunch of parsley. Blend again, adding enough water to make it the taste and consistency you desire.


Drink two to three helpings on your detox day., This is a spring detox that has been used for centuries. Dandelion leaves support the elimination functions of the kidneys, and dandelion root supports the function of the liver. In the spring, pick about 10 large herbicide-free dandelion leaves. Wash them well and chop them finely. Next, get dried root from a local herbalist. This root should be dried for about a year before it is ready to use.


Mix three tablespoons of dandelion root and six tablespoons of chopped dandelion leaves into two cups of boiled water. Let the leaves and root steep for about 10 minutes, then strain and drink.
This tea can be stored in the refrigerator and used as a cold drink as well. Drink at least four cups a day.
While dandelion is rich in vitamins, fiber, and minerals, it is low in protein and calories. Use this detox about once a week., This fruit detox is high in fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. It is an overall healthy drink that you can drink as often as you would like, even on non-detox days. If you add yogurt, it’s a healthy smoothie. The added lecithin and flaxseed oil provide essential omega-3 fatty acids as well. Mix all the necessary ingredients in a blender until smooth.


You can refrigerate this juice or drink it right after making.

, This tropically-based detox juice is high in nutrients. If you have any digestive issues, try this juice on a non-fasting day. It is full of digestive enzymes that will help you get the most of your food. Blend one medium ripe papaya, one small pineapple, a one inch piece peeled fresh ginger, and one medium kiwi in a blender until well mixed. Pour into a glass and drink. Add ½ cup fresh young coconut milk or coconut water if you want it a little thinner.


Make sure to peel, core, and seed your fruits as appropriate before you chop them., The pectin in apples is thought to help flush out cholesterol and toxins through the liver and kidneys. The citric acid in lemons have a mild laxative effect, which helps your digestive system remove waste. Add 16 ounces of organic apple juice with the juice of two lemons and two limes. Mix together, then add one cup of water. Mix well again and refrigerate.


Makes four servings of the juice."

See your doctor.,
Submit to diagnostic testing.,
Eat yogurt.,
Take acidophilus pills.,
Use prescription treatments.,
Sterilize items in contact with your mouth.",How to Treat Candida2," Thrush is a candida infection of the mouth or throat. It’s most common in children, but it can also occur in adults, especially those with otherwise compromised immune systems. Your doctor will begin by performing a physical examination of your mouth and throat. She’ll look for raised white patches of film with red inflammation beneath. She may also look down your throat for similar white lesions.Ensure that you see the baby’s pediatrician for cases of thrush in infants. These cases often get better on their own, and the pediatrician may choose to monitor rather than immediately treat the infection.
It is quite common for infants to get thrush from breastfeeding, and it can appear on the mother's breast as well. This is because the infant often comes into contact with candida when passing through the birth canal (through the vagina).
If your breastfeeding baby has thrush, your doctor will likely treat it with Nystatin mouthwash in small amounts for your baby, as well as an anti fungal cream for your breasts to prevent the infection from being passed back and forth between the two of you. Diflucan is commonly prescribed to mothers when the baby has thrush.

, Your physician will want to confirm thrush as the diagnosis. He or she will ask you to submit to diagnostic testing depending on the severity of your case. Most cases are straightforward, and your doctor will scrape one of your sores in your mouth to look at the sample under a microscope.For more severe cases where the candida may have spread to your esophagus, you doctor will likely take a throat culture sample to have a lab determine exactly what germs are present., If your doctor determines that you have a very mild case of thrush (especially due to taking a recent antibiotic), then he or she may simply recommend that you eat yogurt with active cultures.This will help restore the balance of naturally occurring bacteria in your mouth and throat, making the environment less inhabitable by candida fungi.

, Acidophilus is one of the active cultures you’ll find in yogurt, but it’s also available in pill form. You can find these pills available without a prescription, and they’ll also help restore the natural equilibrium of germs in your mouth and throat., If your doctor determines that your case requires a prescription-strength treatment, then he or she may write you a prescription for one of several options. These anti-fungal medications come in a variety of forms, including:Anti-fungal mouthwashes such as Nystatin
Anti-fungal mouth lozenges (clotrimazole)
Pills or syrups, including fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox)
If your child’s pediatrician decides that the case of thrush requires a prescription drug, then he or she will write a prescription for one of the options proven safe in infants, such as fluconazole (Diflucan) or micafungin (Mycamine)., To prevent the possibility of reinfecting yourself with the fungus once it’s cleared up, you should change your toothbrush. For infants, ensure that you sterilize any teething toys and all items used in feeding such as the nipples from bottles."

Whole wheat products are also better for your digestion.


The definition of nutritious food is: Food that is a significant source of fiber, vitamins, and (preferably) organic substances. Organic and whole foods are more nutritious than processed foods. Processed foods have been stripped of their nutrients, leaving them unhealthy to eat.;
, You might want to put this on your refrigerator as a reminder.


Avoid food with saturated or trans fats. Low-sodium foods are also more healthy. Look for food rich in fiber and calcium. Eating less sugar is also important.

Get more alpha-linolenic acid by consuming seeds, nuts, and unprocessed vegetable oils. Cook with naturally pressed olive oil or canola oil. Consider snacking on walnuts in between meals and adding flaxseed to your diet.
Consume types of fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon, trout, and sardines are good choices. Try to eat fish like this three times each week.;
, Like healthy fats, most fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and other nutrients that have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body.


Fruits and vegetables contain polyphenol. a type of antioxidant that can help improve your overall cardiovascular health.
Maximize the health benefits you receive from fresh produce by leaving the skins on. The skins of most fruits and vegetables contain more dietary fiber than the flesh, and fiber can also help lower CRP.

, People who consume fiber-rich diets are approximately 63 percent less likely to have elevated CRP levels than those who consume inadequate amounts of fiber.If you aren't able to get more fiber into your diet naturally, try adding 1 tsp (5 ml) of psyllium, an effective fiber supplement, to an 8-oz (250-ml) glass of water or juice each morning.

, In particular, ginger and turmeric are believed to help reduce inflammation within the body and can thereby help lower CRP levels, too. Try cooking a meal that contains either seasoning at least once or twice a week.


If you don't like the taste of either spice, you could take curcumin supplements. Curcumin is extracted from turmeric, and it's the component believed to be directly linked to turmeric's anti-inflammatory properties., Moderate amounts of dark chocolate can lower CRP levels, but too much will still do more harm than good. Eat approximately 20 grams (0.71 oz) of dark chocolate twice a week for optimal results.


When selecting the right type of chocolate, look for something that consists of at least 70 percent cocoa. Semi-sweet and milk chocolate do not provide the same benefit as intense dark chocolate does.
Eating dark chocolate in small amounts like this can help reduce CRP levels by roughly 20 percent.

, Most of your nutrition should be satisfied by your actual diet, but if improvements to your diet still aren't enough, you can also help lower your CRP levels by taking the right dietary supplements.


Vitamin C is one of the most beneficial options. Taking a daily dose of 1000 mg can help reduce your CRP levels by 25 percent.Taking 300 mg of krill oil each day for two weeks can cause CRP to drop by up to 30 percent. Similarly, taking two daily 1000 mg doses of standard fish oil capsules for up to six months can also lower CRP by comparable amounts.
Other nutritional supplements that may help reduce your CRP include magnesium, vitamin D, and omega-7. Multivitamins that contain several beneficial vitamins and minerals can also benefit your heart.

, Refined foods and foods made with refined ingredients can be particularly damaging, so you should cut as many out of your diet as possible if you want to drop your CRP.


Stay away from foods made with large amounts of refined flour and sugar. Similarly, you should also avoid refined vegetable oils like cottonseed, safflower, or corn oil. Hydrogenated fats should be completely cut from your diet.
Drink less alcohol, too. Regular consumption of alcohol puts your body into a state of chronic inflammation, which can cause your CRP to dramatically increase.

, Moderate amounts of moderate exercise can help lower inflammation and CRP levels. Additionally, it can help you lose weight, which can encourage your CRP to drop even further.


Too much exercise can stress your heart and increase inflammation just as much as too little exercise, so you need to aim for moderation. Try to exercise at a steady pace for 30 to 45 minutes roughly five days each week. Options worth considering include brisk walking, cycling, and swimming.

, Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing and maintaining elevated CRP levels. Large fat cells excrete more interleukin-6, an internal chemical that tells your liver to produce more CRP.


While your overall weight is important, you should pay special attention to your waist size. Women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 cm) and men with a waist size over 40 inches (102 cm) are more likely to have elevated CRP levels., Even though losing weight is important, it's equally important that you lose weight in an appropriate manner. Some weight-loss diets can lower weight while actually raising CRP levels.Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets (like Atkins) have a tendency to raise CRP levels. In fact, consistently maintaining such a diet for several months can cause CRP to increase by 25 percent.
Diets that are low in unhealthy fats and high in complex carbohydrates are generally much better. When paired with regular moderate exercise, the benefits are even more pronounced.

, Smoking causes the walls of your arteries to harden, which may increase inflammation and encourage your CRP levels to spike.


Quit smoking as early as possible to improve your results. It can take up to ten years to reverse arterial damage caused by smoking, and the process can only begin after you quit.

, Try to get between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. Getting less than six hours can increase inflammation.


Additionally, getting too much sleep can also cause CRP to increase. People who regularly sleep for more than eight each night are more likely to experience increased inflammation than those who only sleep for seven to eight hours.

, The presence of excess stress hormones can cause your body to release more inflammatory chemicals, which will usually cause CRP levels to rise. Finding time to relax can cause both your stress hormones and CRP to drop.


If you find it difficult to switch to a more relaxing lifestyle, try to schedule at least 15 minutes of heavy relaxation time each day. Meditate, practice deep breathing, take a bubble bath, or listen to relaxing music. Nearly any activity that helps you unwind can help.

, When possible, it's a good idea to check your CRP sometime in your early to mid 30s, especially if you have an elevated risk for heart disease. Your doctor can check your CRP with a blood test.


Your numbers might be healthy while you're young, but by checking them early in your life, you'll get a baseline number that you and your doctor can use to help predict your future risk.
For most adults, CRP levels lower than 1.0 mg/L indicate a low risk of heart disease. CRP between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L indicate an average risk, and levels above 3.0 mg/L indicate a high risk.

, If you have an intermediate risk of heart disease, you should consult your doctor about regular CRP testing as you get older. Depending on your health and circumstances, it might be wise to test every five years or so.


Note that there are two CRP blood tests. One shows non-specific CRP levels that occur with general internal inflammation, while the other shows highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) levels. The latter measures inflammation within your blood vessels, so this is the test you'll need if you want to determine your risk for heart disease.If you have arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other autoimmune conditions, your doctor may need to give you an altered form of the CRP test since these conditions can raise your levels beyond the range used to assess cardiac health.

, When diet and lifestyle changes aren't enough to help drop your CRP levels, your doctor may recommend statin drugs. This is especially common for patients who also have elevated LDL cholesterol.


Statin drugs have pros and cons, so you should carefully consider your options before opting for this form of medication. Some possible side effects include muscle pain, muscle damage, liver damage, digestive problems, rashes, increased blood sugar, and neurological effects."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, as well as strength-training exercises on two or more days a week. Walking, dancing, swimming, cycling, aerobics, and resistance training are all types of exercise that can help naturally lower your blood sugar., Lack of sleep can interfere with your body’s ability to regulate insulin and glucose, and can even increase your risk for weight gain. Start going to bed earlier, and make changes to your sleeping environment as needed to ensure you get enough sleep every night. For example, buy blackout curtains for your bedroom, wear ear plugs, and invest in a comfortable mattress that allows you to sleep throughout the night., Sugary foods and beverages such as candy, soda, juice, and desserts will naturally cause your blood sugar to spike. Over time, a diet high in sugary foods will cause your body to become resistant to insulin, and interfere with your body’s ability to regulate insulin and glucose., During stress, your body’s stress hormones naturally cause blood sugar levels to rise for the sake of boosting your energy levels. Long-term stress can increase your risk for weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Find healthy, natural ways to manage stress without the use of medication, such as exercising regularly, practicing deep breathing, listening to relaxing music, taking a bath, and reading.

, Consuming an excessive amount of alcohol can lead to chronic inflammation of the pancreas and impair its ability to secrete insulin, whereas nicotine contains compounds that interfere with your body’s ability to regulate insulin. Stop smoking tobacco products, and cut back on excessive alcohol intake to lower your blood sugar naturally.

, Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for high blood sugar levels, since excess body weight is linked to problems with hormonal imbalance and insulin resistance. Start exercising regularly, get plenty of sleep, and eat healthy, whole foods that lack preservatives, additives, and sugar to lose weight naturally and lower blood sugar.

, The majority of whole, healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts, seeds, legumes, fatty fish, whole grains, spices, and herbs contain vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that naturally help lower blood sugar. Examples of foods that can help lower blood sugar are cinnamon, salmon, oranges, almonds, kale, beans, green tea, and apple cider vinegar. Consult with your nutritionist or dietitian to learn more about foods that can help naturally lower blood sugar based on your personal health and medical history., Certain nutritional supplements such as calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, fish oil, and chromium can help your body regulate insulin and improve insulin sensitivity. The average American usually fails to receive the daily recommended amount of vitamins and minerals through diet alone, which is why supplementation can often help improve or reverse certain health conditions.

, If a professional is not administering your test, keep in mind that collecting measurements from certain points, such as your back, may be difficult — if not impossible — on your own.

, Body fat calipers do not measure body fat percentage directly. They are used to administer the “pinch test,” which takes measurements of skinfolds from three to ten points on the body.That information is then plugged into a formula to compute your body fat percentage. The accuracy of skinfold calipers for measuring body fat percentage depends on both the experience of the person using the calipers and the formula used to compute the results.

, There are over 100 equations used to calculate body fat percentage from a pinch test. Each is specific to groups of people according to characteristics such as age, gender, race, and fitness level, which affect where bodies tend to store adipose fat. Plugging in the same data to several different equations can return results that vary by several percentage points.Common equations include Jackson & Pollock, Parrillo, and Navy Tape.
To choose a formula that makes sense for you, work with a fitness professional and use it as a benchmark of your progress. Or, forgo the formula completely and just keep track of the skinfold measurements.Many body fat calculators are available online, making it easy to calculate the results of a pinch test with a few or several measurements., At the start of a fitness regimen to reduce your body fat percentage, it is useful to get a baseline measurement. Keep this information in a log (personal training journals and fitness apps are good options) along with your exercise routine (e.g., mileage walked, weightlifting sets) over time.


Recommended ranges for a healthy percentage of body fat differ according to gender, age, and fitness level. Women with more than 32% of body fat and men with more than 26% of body fat are considered obese.If you’re trying to lose body fat, taking weekly measurements can help you adjust your fitness routine to improve your results. If you want to maintain your current body fat composition, monthly measurements may be more useful.Get a set of skinfold calipers. There are many types of calipers available on the consumer market. Ideally, an experienced examiner is administering the pinch test for you and has good-quality calipers. If you are administering the test yourself, you can purchase calipers at many different price points (from a few dollars to a couple hundred) and from many different retailers.
You may want to invest in high-quality calipers, which will be more expensive. Cheap calipers may not exert the appropriate amount of constant pressure necessary to provide adequate tension control and reliable results. Some highly recommended calipers include Harpenden Skinfold Calipers, Lafayette Skinfold Calipers, Lange Calipers, Slim Guide Skinfold Calipers, and Accu-Measure Body Fat Calipers., Pinch tests measure skinfolds at three, four, seven, and even ten points on the body. Taking measurements from more points does not ensure accuracy of the body fat percentage calculation. That depends on the precision used when taking the measurements and the formula used to calculate body fat.

, The key is to be consistent with the exact locations as well as pinch-type (vertical vs. horizontal). In general, the right side of the body on a standing subject is used when obtaining measurements. Common areas to measure skinfolds include:Triceps — Have the subject bend the elbow to 90 degrees and mark the point midway between the top of the shoulder and elbow.Then, measure a vertical fold (with the calipers at a 90 degree angle) at that midway point with the arm hanging naturally at the subject's side.

Biceps — With the arm extended naturally at the subject’s side, take a vertical fold at the front of the arm, halfway between the shoulder and the crook of the elbow.Subscapular — Measurements of the subscapular area should be taken as a diagonal fold (calipers held at a 45 degree angle) across the back, just below the shoulder blade.Thigh — Take a vertical fold on the standing leg, midway between the kneecap and the crease where the thigh meets the hip.

Iliac crest — Have the subject hold their right arm across the body. Use a horizontal pinch to take this measurement right above the hip bone on the side of the body.Abdominal — A measurement in the abdominal area should be a vertical fold one inch to right of navel.

Calf — With the foot resting on a chair or platform at approximately 90 degrees, take the measurement as a vertical fold on the inside of the calf at the point with the largest circumference.Chest — Measure the pectoral region by taking a diagonal fold midway between the nipple and upper part of the pectoral muscle at the armpit.Axilla — The axilla area is on the side of the upper chest. A measurement here should be taken as a vertical fold directly under the center of the armpit and perpendicular to the nipple.

Supraspinale — A measurement of the supraspinale area should be a diagonal fold at the intersection of a vertical line between the spinal (front part of iliac crest, the protrusion of the hip bone) and front part of the armpit) and a horizontal line at the top of the iliac crest.This region is also called the suprailiac, in some measurement systems.

, Making a ""C"" with your left thumb and index finger, grab as big of a skinfold as you can until it hurts, then pull outwards.Be sure that you pinch the same exact amount of skin at the same exact location for repeat measurements.


It is important that you do not exclude any ""pinchable"" skin nor include any underlying muscle.

, Place the jaw ends over the skinfold while continuing to pinch the skinfold with your left hand. Using your right thumb, press down where indicated on the caliper until you feel a slight click. This sound represents the correct measurement as the caliper jaws automatically stop at the width of your skinfold.Repeat this step three times for each landmark to ensure reliability. If the measurements differ (they should only differ by 1 – 2 mm), obtain and record the average of the three measurements.


Be sure to measure the center of the skinfold between your fingers.

, Be sure to record the average of all three measurements in an organized fashion to avoid confusion during calculation. Its best to use a notebook and save all measurements as a log so you may compare them as time goes on.

, After calculating your result, record it in your fitness journal or app.

Think about what you can do and what you cannot do physically. There are many tests and assessments you can take to find out your level, but if you are reading this, you have probably already decided to improve your fitness and now want to make a plan.


Consider your cardiovascular health. Can you go up a flight of stairs without getting out of breath? Can you walk short or long distances easily? If not, then one goal might be to improve your heart and lung function.
Consider your strength. Can you lift 20, 30, or even 50 pounds easily? Can you do pushups? If not, then your goal might be to build strength in your upper body.
Consider your flexibility. Can you touch your toes when you bend over, or even your knees? If not, then you might make enhancing your flexibility another one of your goals.;
, While working out, you will want to have a way to identify how far you've come, and how far you have to go. Here are a few possibilities:


Consider a health improvement like walking up a flight of stairs without getting winded, or you might set a goal to get the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week by going for a 30 minute walk on five days out of every week. Focusing on these practical goals as your starting points may help to keep you motivated.
Take off a few inches. Imagine your ideal body shape - maybe the waist size from years ago - then do a full body measurement to see how far away you are. Make sure to record your measurements to track your progress. Before and after pictures can be very positive reinforcement.
Pick a race distance you would like to run (e.g. 5K, 10K, Marathon) and determine how many miles you can presently run. Slowly increase the mileage along your way - some programs even permit walking - and you'll soon be on your way to the finish line., Plan when you will work out on which days, when your workout plans will reach the final goal, and what you will do to get there. Figure out how you can get 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week. If you are really pressed for time, make that 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Weight training or resistance training is recommended twice a week and can be included in the 150 minutes of moderate exercise. Here are a variety of recommendations:


Create the perfect schedule. Finding time to work out is difficult, otherwise there wouldn’t be various programs promising major results in minimal time. Balance other obligations with your schedule.Set an end-date for your goal. Knowing the date of the doctor visit, race, wedding, or class reunion will help the goal become realistic. If the date is four months from tomorrow, that is the window you have to build your schedule.
Give yourself enough time. Depending on your goal and a variety of other health-related factors, success may not come quickly. It is important to balance expectation with the ability to fully commit. Ensure there is enough time - results could take a few months - to see the positive results.Include mini-workouts whenever you have a free moment. Schedule chair dips at work, core contractions during your commute, or milk gallon curls for breakfast., Each method has advantages. Putting it on a computer, maybe a spreadsheet, allows for easy tracking. Hand-written plans, however, can be carried around the gym. If you are likely to forget your plan, having something handy might be best.

, A workout schedule needs multiple components to be functional. Training frequency varies, but most fitness plans call for 3-5 days per week of training - some say to workout every day.Other factors follow:


Choose your workouts. Weight training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), running, spin classes, group fitness, the options are limitless.
Follow the standard advice and factor in off-days. Muscles need time to rest and regenerate, so make sure that you take time off from strength training. Most people can safely do cardio 5 to 6 days a week, but check with your doctor to confirm that this is okay in your situation.
Balance your resistance or weight training workout by alternating muscle groups. Record or keep track of the amount of weight, duration, and repetitions. Depending on your focus - strength gain, weight loss, muscle increase, endurance - the weight/repetition balance changes.Cardio workouts, such as walking, running, cycling or doing a cardio machine at the gym, can be measured by distance and time. Be sure to keep a record. You can also see improvements when you record your starting and finishing heart rate. With practice, your heart won't have to work as hard to do the same workout so your heart rate will slow down as you become more fit.

, Fill in where you plan on working out each day to help clarify how you will carry out your plan. If it's a treadmill run or a spin class, then commit to making the trip to the gym for your workout. If you are planning to do a bodyweight strength training workout, then you may be able to just do it at home. Make sure to specify where each workout will take place.

, Different types of people need diets that set them up for success; opt for one that fits your personality. Some people do not even need to adjust what they are eating.


Find your macro/micro balance. Eating a great variety of foods will cover most needs, but one general guideline is to consume more carbohydrates than protein or fat.Limit sodium, sugars, and saturated fats. Not all calories are equal. Try to select foods that satiate hunger longer.Take a diet quiz.Use the results of the quiz to plan out weekly meals. Fit those meals into the various meal breaks of your schedule.

, Maybe you overestimated your fitness level, or bit off a goal larger than you can chew, that's fine. Update your plan as you go along and modify your goals as necessary. A few possible adjustments are:


Lower the weights you had planned on lifting, or the inches you had hoped to lose.
Drop the race distance down a notch. If you had your heart set on a marathon, set your sights on a half-marathon instead. Don't scratch the entire idea, just adjust it.
Add days to your timeline. If you don't want to diminish the intended goal, perhaps the schedule just needs a buffer? Figure the extra time required to reach your goal and just supplement the fitness plan accordingly.

, Positive reinforcement will go a long way towards keep you on track. Try to reward yourself as much as possible without sacrificing the goal itself. Here are a few great ways to celebrate:


Post your successes online and get ready for the kudos.
Buy an outfit you couldn't fit into previously.
Reward sore muscles with a massage.
Indulge in a favorite food or dessert for your ""cheat meal"".

, Get someone on board with your same program, a shared motivation. It will be much easier to put a check-mark on a day of your fitness plan than crossing out a day of inactivity.

Avoid saturated fats and trans fats.,
Cook with healthier oils.,
Increase your intake of omega-3 fats.,
Choose whole grains.,
Cut out sweets.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Decrease your sodium intake.",How to Unclog Arteries Naturally1," Saturated fat is one of the primary culprits in raising your cholesterol.You should equally avoid trans fats, which appear on food labels as “hydrogenated” oils and fats.Butter, margarine, cheese, full-fat dairy products, red meat, and processed meats are a few examples where you can expect to find excessive levels of these fats.Check saturated fat levels on food labels, and limit your daily caloric intake to only five or six percent (13 grams in a 2,000-calorie/day diet, for instance).;
, Since butter, lard, and margarine are all high in unhealthy fats, you should choose healthier cooking oils when preparing food. Some alternatives are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can actually have the opposite effect and help reduce cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.These options include:Olive oil
Canola oil
Peanut oil
Sesame oil
Palm and coconut oils can be used in limited quantities. These contain medium-chain triglycerides, which may decrease triglyceride cholesterol levels and raise HDL (healthy) cholesterol. They pack a lot of calories, however, so use in moderation., Omega-3 fats (so-called “good” fats) help to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.You can find these fats in many foods and especially fish. Salmon, tuna, and trout are all excellent sources of these fats, so try to eat around two servings a week.Other foods rich in omega-3 fats include:Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
Walnuts
Chia seeds
Soy products and tofu
Legumes
Leafy green vegetables
Avocados

, Processed grains cut out the fiber and other healthy components found in grains. Instead of foods made with white flour (white rice, white bread, semolina pasta, etc.), choose whole grain options.You should try to eat three servings of whole grain options each day.These include whole wheat pasta, quinoa, brown rice, oats, nine-grain breads, etc., Sweets are a major source of simple carbohydrates, which can have an impact of several factors related to atherosclerosis such as high blood pressure and obesity. You should eliminate sugary foods and drinks from your diet to help promote heart health.You should limit yourself to a maximum and five sugary items a week (and fewer when you can)., High-fiber foods help to control both cholesterol and blood sugar levels.Add lots of fruits, vegetables, and legumes to your diet to increase fiber. Some of the best options include:Beans
Apples
Citrus fruits
Oats and barley
Nuts
Cauliflower
Green beans
Potatoes
Carrots
Generally speaking, try to eat 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day if you’re a woman and 30 to 38 grams each day if you’re a man., Sodium (found in salt) has an impact on your blood pressure, and high blood pressure also puts you at a higher risk for artery hardening and damage. Choose low-sodium options at the store and restaurants and limit your intake to a maximum of 2,300 mg a day.If your doctor has already diagnosed you with high blood pressure, then you should set even stricter limits around 1,500 mg daily."

Determine your baseline.,
Account for your age.,
Consider your level of activity or exercise.,
Add your height to your base and age points.,
Calculate points for your weight.",How to Work out Weight Watchers Pro Points Allowance1," Weight Watchers calculates a base for you to begin with. This base starts with your gender.

Males: Allow yourself 8 points.
Females: Allow yourself 2 points.
Nursing females: Give yourself 10 points to account for the extra calories needed to sustain your child.;
, As we get older, our metabolism slows down. To account for this, Weight Watchers factors the age difference of clients into the total allowance.


Ages 17 to 26: Add 4 points.
Ages 27 to 37: Add 3 points.
Ages 38 to 47: Add 2 points.
Ages 48 and 57: Add 1 point.
Age 58 and older: Add 0 points.

, How much and with what intensity you exercise has a huge difference on how many calories we burn. Factor your level of exercise into your ProPoints allowance.


Heavy exercise (such as working out more than 30 minutes per day or doing manual labor each day): Add 6 points
Moderately activity (such as walking throughout the workplace all day or doing 30 minutes of exercise daily): Add 4 points.
Low activity (such as standing or moving throughout an office): Add 2 points.
Inactivity: Add 0 points.

, Much like calculating BMI, this will allow you to reach your total points once weight is added as well.


155 cm (5 feet, 1 inch) and shorter: Add 0 points.
155 cm (5 feet, 1 inch) to 178 cm (5 feet, 10 inches): Add 1 point.
178 cm (5 feet, 10 inches) and taller: Add 2 points.

, These will be added to the base, activity, age and height calculations. Take 10 percent of your body weight and add this number to your totals.


For example, someone who weighs 160 pounds takes 10% of 160, or 16, and adds that to their total.
Someone who weighs 200 pounds, for example, would take 20 and add that to their total.

Stop smoking.,
Get more exercise.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Manage your stress levels.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Manage your diabetes.,
See your doctor regularly.",How to Unclog Arteries Naturally2," The chemicals in cigarette and other tobacco smoke damage your blood cells, as well as disrupting the function of your heart and blood vessels.Each of these things leads to the buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis).Quitting smoking is one of the best steps you can take for the health of your heart and lungs.


Quitting cold turkey often proves too difficult for many. Take advantage of smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches and gums, support communities, etc. as you undertake the process of cutting out tobacco use.

, Exercise has a cascading effect that helps with a variety of the conditions that lead to clogged arteries. Regular exercise helps you lose excess weight, relieves high blood pressure, and lowers LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.If you’re new to an exercise regimen, you may need to start slower. Consult your doctor to set up an exercise plan appropriate for you.


Once you acclimate to an exercise routine, you should aim to complete thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as jogging or cycling) five times a week. If you prefer high-intensity workouts (such as crossfit routines), then aim for seventy-five minutes a week.Aerobic exercise is anything that gets your heart rate up.It can include high-impact running or sports or low-impact exercise such as swimming and biking.

, The changes to your diet and physical activity will go a long way toward bringing you down to a healthy weight. You can set an actual goal for your weight using the body mass index (BMI), which uses your weight and height to estimate your body fat percentage.Aim for the normal range, which is between 18.5 and 24.9 on the index.Medical professionals consider 25 to 29.9 overweight and consider 30 or higher obese.You can find more info on calculating your BMI at How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI).

, Experiencing high levels of stress releases stress hormones in your body that can have a chronic inflammatory effect, ultimately increasing your risk of atherosclerosis.If you experience high stress levels at work or at home, then it’s important to have proper coping mechanisms to relax and reduce this risk. Steps you can take to reduce stress include:Increasing your level of physical activity
Meditation
Calming activities such as yoga or tai chi.
Enjoying music, movies, or other art that you find calming and peaceful
Channeling the energy into some of your favorite relaxing hobbies

, Alcohol abuse puts you at a higher risk for atherosclerosis.Generally speaking, men should limit themselves to two alcoholic beverages a day, and women should limit themselves to one.The measurement size for one drink varies by alcohol type. Use this guideline:Beer: 12 ounces
Wine: 5 ounces
Liquor: 1.5 ounces

, Having type 2 diabetes puts you at an increased risk of atherosclerosis.If you are diabetic, stay on top of the disease by performing your blood glucose testing, managing your diet, and staying physically active.Consult your physician about the most appropriate plan for your specific case.

, Your doctor will want to monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels closely as you make changes to help bring them into a healthy range. Keep regular appointments to monitor these indicators and mark your progress."

Look for fish oils that contain EPA and DHA oils., If you have difficulty getting enough fiber from foods, you can take psyllium supplements. Psyllium is a water-soluble fiber available in pill and powder forms (Metamucil).

, Soy proteins are commonly available as powders that you can mix into a variety of foods and beverages (juices, smoothies, etc.). Several studies have shown that soy protein supplementation can have a beneficial effect on your cholesterol levels.Take as directed.

, You can also take niacin (vitamin B3) to help lower cholesterol levels.However, talk to your physician and monitor niacin supplementation closely. Common side effects at high doses include:Flushing of the skin
Stomach upset
Headaches
Dizziness
Blurred vision
Increased risk of liver damage

, Some studies have shown that garlic can decrease the risk of atherosclerosis and positively affect blood pressure.You can simply add more fresh garlic to your food or take garlic supplements if you don’t enjoy garlic in foods., Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol are two additional supplements that may have a positive impact on cholesterol.You can find these options in supplement form at most vitamin shops or health food stores.

, CoQ-10 is an essential nutrient used to treat a variety of heart and blood vessel conditions.It can also counteract muscle pain resulting from other cholesterol-lowering medications called “statins.”Consider taking CoQ-10 if your doctor has prescribed one of these medications.

Take note of additional medical problems that may interfere.,
Beware of medications that can interact negatively.",How to Take L Carnitine," When the body does not absorb or make sufficient carnitine, doctors will prescribe oral L-carnitine.Carnitine levels may be low because of many reasons. Genetic disorders are the most common, but medical procedures such as hemodialysis also drain the body of L-carnitine temporarily. Vegetarians or anyone who is on a strict diet may also have low carnitine levels.;
, Patients with serious kidney disease often have low red blood cell counts. Taking L-carnitine supplements is proven to be an effective way to increase red blood cell counts in these patients.


Kidneys are responsible for synthesizing carnitine in the body. Kidney disease decreases carnitine and lowers red blood cell count.

, If you struggle with complications related to heart disease and heart failure, your doctor may prescribe L-carnitine, especially if you have chest pain or have had a heart attack. There is strong evidence that suggests L-carnitine supplements mitigate symptoms.


Patients with stable angina may benefit from L-carnitine supplements when it is taken with propionyl-L-carnitine. Both may reduce symptoms and improve the ability to exercise without chest pain.Heart attack victims benefit from L-carnitine supplements when taken with conventional medications. It may reduce the risk of a second heart attack, chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure.
Patients who have experienced heart failure may benefit from L-carnitine. This supplement may improve exercise capacity.

, Studies suggest that a low dose of L-carnitine can help infants born prematurely and with a low birth weight by... The supplement can help infants get more benefit from the nutrition supplied to them at the hospital.

, Patients on anti-seizure medications containing valproic acid may be able to minimize and prevent side effects from that medication.


However, L-carnitine has been linked to an increased risk of seizures in patients prone to seizures, so using the supplement to combat side effects associated with anti-seizure medication can be dangerous and should only be done under doctor's supervision.
L-carnitine may mitigate side effects associated with AZT (an HIV/AIDS medication), doxorubicin (chemotherapy medication), and isotretinoin (acne medication). Research is needed to verify these claims before L-carnitine can be recommended in these cases.

, If you suffer hyperthyroidism, your thyroid gland produces excess hormone and you may have symptoms of nervousness, weakness, tremors and rapid heartbeat. Research indicates that L-carnitine reduces these symptoms.


Research also suggests that carnitine might block the action of thyroid hormone, which is why the effect of excess thyroid hormone is reduced when it is taken.

, L-carnitine supplements may help correct male infertility problems caused by inflammation of the prostrate, seminal vesicles and epididymis.


Low sperm count has been linked to low levels of carnitine. L-carnitine supplements may increase sperm count and mobility.
Propionyl-L-carnitine may help men suffering erectile dysfunction, especially if they are also using conventional medication for this condition.

, L-carnitine has been used to treat many conditions in the past, but medical studies have either ruled the supplement to be ineffective or results were inconclusive for those conditions.


Studies suggest that L-carnitine does not improve athletic ability. There is no evidence that L-carnitine improves athletic performance or endurance.
L-carnitine is often marketed as a weight loss supplement, but there is no evidence to back weight loss claims.
While the verdict may change favorably in the future, there is insufficient evidence to support claims that L-carnitine can improve:

Fatigue due to celiac disease, age, cancer, hepatitis C, or memory disorders.
Leg pain caused by poor circulation (peripheral vascular disease). Some studies suggest propionyl-L-carnitine may reduce symptoms of PVD, but evidence is still inconclusive.
Symptoms of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.
Rett syndrome.
Eating disorders.
Diabetes. Preliminary studies indicate that acetyl-L-carnitine may reduce pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, but evidence remains inconclusive.
High cholesterol.
Blood disorders.
Leg ulcers.
Lyme disease.
Autism.



, Patients who lack a natural source of L-carnitine in the body are usually instructed to take two to three doses each day, with each dose containing 990 mg. They may take the supplement in tablet form or as an oral solution.

, If you are taking Depacon, Depakene, Depakote, VPA, or any other anti-seizure medication containing valproic acid, you should take a 50 to 100 mg of L-carnitine over the course of three to four doses each day. At most, you should receive no more than 3 grams of the amino acid per day.

, L-carnitine prescribed for the treatment of chest pain and congestive heart failure should be taken twice a day, and each dose should total 1 gram.


Doctors who prescribe L-carnitine for patients who have already suffered a heart attack may instruct them to take a total of 2 to 6 grams throughout the course of a single day.

, Patients taking L-carnitine for hyperthyroidism should take 1 to 2 grams of the supplement two times a day.

, As a treatment against male infertility, L-carnitine should be taken once a day at a dose of 2 grams. Patients should also take a single daily dose of 1 gram L-acetyl-carnitine in conjunction with standard L-carnitine.

, If you take L-carnitine for any other reason, you will need to work with your doctor to find the right dose. In most cases, the usual dose for adults will be between 1 to 3 grams each day.


Never give L-carnitine to a child without your doctor's direct supervision.
Infants with a low birth weight may receive L-carnitine intravenously or orally while at the hospital, but this treatment will usually stop before the child is sent home with the parents.

, Most side effects are mild to moderate in degree and typically include nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, heartburn, diarrhea, and seizures.


High doses of L-carnitine can also cause your urine, breath, and sweat to have a pungent fish-like odor.

, While L-carnitine can be helpful for patients suffering from hyperthyroidism, those suffering with hypothyroidism or an under-active thyroid gland should be especially careful when taking L-carnitine. The supplement is potentially capable of making hypothyroidism worse.

, There is no evidence suggesting that L-carnitine can induce seizures in healthy individuals, but for those who have experienced seizures in the past, the supplement may make a recurring seizure more likely.


If you need the supplement to combat the side effects of your anti-seizure medication, talk with your doctor to verify that L-carnitine is really the safest way to go.

, There is no evidence suggesting that small doses of L-carnitine are unsafe for a mother to use while she is breast-feeding her baby, but proceed with caution nonetheless.


There is not enough information on the effect of L-carnitine on a growing fetus, so pregnant women should stay away from the supplement during pregnancy.

, While most individuals can take L-carnitine safely, certain medical issues may make the supplement somewhat risky.


Patients who are most at risk are those suffering from peripheral vascular disease, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, diabetes, and kidney disease. While L-carnitine can be used to help some of these conditions, you should only attempt to do so under strict medical supervision.

, Patients on certain medications should avoid L-carnitine to reduce the risk of harmful drug interactions.


Acenocoumarol and warfarin slow blood clotting, and L-carnitine may enhance the effectiveness of these drugs and cause blood clotting to slow too quickly.
Thyroid hormone works less effectively when L-carnitine is present in the body.
D-carnitine supplements can interfere with L-carnitine. This is true of L-carnitine produced naturally and that which is ingested via a supplemental form.

Know how to get diagnosed.",How to Treat Bowel Incontinence," The right diet for those with bowel incontinence is neither a low nor high fiber diet but rather a diet with the correct amount of fiber. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a daily consumption of 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day for adults and “age plus five” grams for children is recommended.Good sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables, whole grain rice, beans, whole wheat pasta, seed, oats, nuts and whole meal bread. However, don't go overboard, especially if you have diarrhea. A moderate amount of fiber is needed to balance between diarrhea and constipation.;
, Drinking a lot of water helps both bowel incontinence and possible dehydration from it. Increased water intake will help replenish fluids lost from diarrhea and will help with constipation, making the feces moist and easy to remove.


An adult is advised to drink 2 liters (0.5 US gal) or more of water every day to help with constipation. This is the equivalent to 8 to 10 glasses per day to help liquify the stool for easy passage.

, Many people are lactose intolerant and cannot digest lactose (“sugar” from the milk). The body removes it through diarrhea that worsens bowel incontinence. Therefore, removing milk and dairy products from your diet might help lessen bowel incontinence.


All dairy products are discouraged, including ice cream, cheese, and yogurt. If you're craving these foods, choose soy or coconut milk alternatives.

, Caffeine is a stimulant. Stimulants increase bodily functions, especially in the gastrointestinal tract. Avoiding coffee, tea, chocolates or any caffeinated products will help keep your digestive system regular as these substances speed up activity in the stomach and intestines, leading to diarrhea, gas, bloating, and upset stomach. Even if you don't think caffeine is a part of your food or drink, read the label before consuming just to be sure.


If you can’t stop drinking caffeinated products, try to find a substitute such as orange juice. Drinking coffee, for example, is somewhat a habit instead of an actual desire or need.

, Herbs and condiments sometimes affect how the gastrointestinal system functions. Your condition could be aggravated by certain herbs and spices that lead to diarrhea, gas, or upset stomach. Hams, sausages and smoked fish are some examples of cured foods that could also be triggers.


Peppers and chilies are highly discouraged, too. The less spicy your food is, the better. Spicy foods can easily cause stomach, esophageal, and intestinal issues.

, Alcohol should not be taken because it hastens digestive chemical reactions. Alcohol aids in digestion especially with fats – thus it should be avoided to decrease gastric irritation.The aim is to regulate the process of digestion; to do so, alcohol or alcohol containing foods must be avoided.


This goes for all kinds of alcohol, from wine and beer to straight liquor and mixed drinks. Even if there are just trace amounts of alcohol, it's best avoided just to be on the safe side.

, There are different classifications of anti-diarrheals, and anti-propulsives are just one. These drugs work by reducing the peristalsis (a wave-like movement) of the gastrointestinal tract and increasing the tone of the anal sphincter. This ultimately can help delay bowel movement.Imodium is an example of an anti-propulsive, anti-diarrheal drug. For chronic diarrhea (which is often found with bowel incontinence), a 2 capsule starting dose must be taken orally followed by a capsule taken once a day. Each capsule of Imodium contains 2 mg of loperamide. Imodium is generally prescribed in lower doses that are taken regularly.

, These drugs act by slowing peristalsis, targeting the autonomic nervous system. The ANS (Autonomic Nervous System) is involved in the involuntary actions of the body (like gastrointestinal movements) therefore also delaying bowel movement.Lomotil is one common example. This drug requires a prescription and cannot be purchased over-the-counter. In adults, the usual dose is 5 mg (2 tablets) of Lomotil three to four times per day initially. Thereafter, the dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg (1 tablet) two to three times a day., Atropine works as an antidiarrheal and anticholinergic. It decreases the movement of the gastrointestinal tract thus extending the time to defecate. Atropine also works like an opioid but without the risks of addiction. Atropine is taken as a liquid by mouth in 10 mL twice a day.Hyoscyamine is a medication similar to atropine. It works by decreasing the motion of the stomach and intestines and decreases the secretion of stomach fluids, including acid. It is available as a tablet, capsule, or liquid. It, too, is only available by prescription and your doctor will determine the dosage that's right for you., Laxatives are given to create a “consistent” stool instead of a watery-like stool that is harder to control. This medication treats constipation by increasing the bulk in the stool, an effect that aids movement of the intestines and increases the amount of water in the stool, making the stool softer and easier to pass.Metamucil (methylcellulose) is a common solution used for bowel incontinence. A 3.5 mg dose can be taken thrice a day after mixing it in water or fruit juice.

, This process is performed to remove impacted stools from the rectum. However, this is reserved for more serious cases – your doctor will know if it's a viable option for you.


In this procedure, a small tube is inserted into the anus. A special solution is then applied to cleanse the rectum and to soften the hard stool.

, Some interventions your doctor may recommend are as follows:Sphincteroplasty. This procedure is done to repair damaged sphincter muscles and to provide additional support. Some muscle tissues are removed surgically; the edges are then overlapped and are sewn together.

Sacral nerve stimulation. This is recommended for patients diagnosed with destabilized sphincter muscles. It starts by application of electrodes on the skin of the lower back that are attached to a pulse generator. The apparatus then discharges electric impulses to stimulate sacral nerves to work properly and reduce periods of bowel incontinence.

Tibial nerve stimulation. This is a new type of treatment that introduces a fine needle into the tibial nerve. An electrode is then applied on the foot and a gentle electric impulse is released through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve.

Injection of bulking agents. This is utilized to reinforce the sphincter muscles and the rectum. Examples of bulking agents are silicone and collagen.

Endoscopic heat therapy. This is a fairly expensive procedure that applies heat energy into the sphincter muscles by means of a thin probe. It is helpful in muscle contraction that controls irregularities in bowel movement.

Stimulated graciloplasty. This is where a small portion of thigh muscle is taken to create new sphincter muscles to replace damaged ones. Electrodes are then inserted into the new sphincter wherein a pulse generator is positioned inside the abdomen. The device generates electric current to the new sphincter to guide it in assuming the normal function of the muscle sphincters.

Artificial sphincter. A circular cuff is placed under the skin around the anus and is filled with fluids to maintain closure. A tube connected to a control pump is then placed under the cuff. A special kind of balloon is positioned into the abdomen and also connected to the control pump through tubing that goes under the skin. Once activated, the fluid contained in the cuff drains into the balloon that makes the anus open making the passage of stool easier.

Colostomy. This is typically the last resort if other surgeries fail. It is a procedure that cuts the colon and manipulates it through the stomach walls to form an artificial opening. A colostomy bag is attached to the opening to collect feces.

, Keeping the area around the anus clean is top priority. This not only prevents skin breakdown and infection, but it also helps preserve your self-esteem. For the record, don't use toilet paper to avoid skin irritation. Instead, wash the area with water and soap. Always carry a clean up set anywhere you go to make this easier. These contents should be part of your clean up set:


Gloves
Wipes
Soap
Deodorizing spray
Tissue
Plastic bag with fasteners
Disposable underpads
Extra underwear and pants

, With your clean up set, wash the area with water and soap. This way you can be sure that no fecal material is left on the skin on the anal area. The presence of fecal material will attract microbes, potentially leading to infection.


Allow it to air dry. Air-drying involves no foreign contact to the area, reducing your risk of infection. Stand in front of an electric fan and allow yourself to dry. There are plenty of small, handy fans available in the market for easy transport. This decreases the possibility of damaging the skin through wipe use because once the integrity of the skin is broken, there is a port of entry for bacteria that can come in from fecal materials causing infection.

, Talcum powder or cornstarch keeps the skin dry and comfortable in this delicate area. Creams could also be used to avoid skin breakdown. Simply apply directly from the urethral area down to the anus to avoid cross contamination.


Skin needs to be dry in order to prevent bacteria from growing and spreading. They prefer dark, wet environments, which makes this area perfect, especially if you don't dry off properly. Using powder or cream ensures that the area is dry and bacteria-free.

, This type of underwear gives the best comfort with regards to contact with human skin. Cotton is the best because it is hypoallergenic and totally breathable.


This is similar to the above point -- cotton helps your skin breathe, keeping the area dry, instead of sealing in moisture and creating a damp, dark environment for bacteria. The more the area can breathe, the better.

, If you have diminished sensation along your rectum due to nerve damage or have persistent constipation, toilet retraining may be a good idea. The objective of the retraining is to:


Improve consistency of stool. This is achieved by proper dietary modifications.
Establish a regular pattern of bowel movement. This is accomplished by finding the most suitable time to have a bowel movement without the need to hurry.
Find other means to stimulate bowel movement. This depends upon your individual preference. For example, some consume hot drinks or meals.

, This is useful training if you have bowel incontinence caused by damaged pelvic floor muscles. The program is recommended to strengthen the weakened muscles and usually requires regular exercise three times a day for the period of six to eight weeks. It is performed by following these steps:


Assume that you are having a bowel movement. Hold this position until the muscles in the anus are tightened.

, Socializing is a challenge for people with bowel incontinence, but it is not at all impossible. Just be sure that you have the clean up set and you are good to go. Upon arriving at a place, check for the nearest bathroom where you can change and do your business. Keep a fairly close distance to the bathroom if you're worried about needing it.


Don't let this keep you from going out and making friends. It's very inconvenient, but it can be handled. If you've followed the guidelines above, bowel incontinence may not be a concern for much longer.

, Bowel incontinence or loss of bowel control can be connected to several factors:



Damage. Muscles and nerves involved in the normal movement of the bowels can be directly harmed during vaginal childbirth or after a surgical intervention that concerns the anus or rectum.

Neurologic diseases. Several underlying conditions can trigger damage of the peripheral nerve that can possibly result in bowel incontinence. Diseases include stroke, spinal cord injury, diabetes, spina bifida and multiple sclerosis.

Inflammatory and irritable bowel disease. Individuals affected by Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis have increased chances of developing bowel incontinence.

Stool seepage. Rectal fistula, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse and even poor anal hygiene can result in the progress of the condition.

Parasite infection. Infestation of parasites may cause abnormalities in the system and can lead to bowel incontinence.

Excessive use of laxatives. Too much intake of laxatives may cause unnecessary relaxation of the sphincters.

Paradoxical diarrhea. Happens when the reservoir is filled with stool that subsequently hardens and become impacted. The liquid portion of the feces then drip out of the system.

, Oftentimes, individuals who experience bowel incontinence are hesitant to converse about the issue because of the social stigma attached to it. Here's what usually accompanies bowel incontinence:



Pruritis Ani. An itch may be felt at the anus due to the possibility of infection and breakdown or ulcer of the skin. Leftover feces bring about infection, irritate the anal area and make it itch.

Involuntary passage of feces or gas. Occurs if the muscle or nerves controlling the rectum and anus are damaged – thus normal functioning is impaired.

Inability to make it to the toilet in time. Individuals with bowel incontinence might find it difficult to reach the bathroom just in time for the bowel movement. It may be due to the spontaneous relaxation of the sphincters.

, During consultation, your health care provider will likely take a complete medical and surgical history to learn more about the possible causes of your bowel incontinence. Severity, consistency and episodes of attack are also considered. Current medication and dietary habits are taken into account, too. Here's what your doctor may do:



Physical examination. Rectal examinations are performed to evaluate the condition of the anal sphincter as well as its strength. This is done by inserting a gloved finger into the rectum.

Anorectal manometry. This is used to measure the amount of pressure present in the rectum during periods of rest and to see how the muscles react if force is applied to the area.

Nerve and muscle conduction test. This is done to study the condition of the anal nerves and muscles. Also used to check the receptiveness of anal nerves to control the sphincter muscles.

Endosonography. This is performed to check the state of the anal sphincters and to evaluate anal muscles for any signs of damage. Images are taken through the ultrasound probe inserted into the anus.

Stool testing. This is usually recommended if bowel incontinence is accompanied by diarrhea. It is used to recognize any signs of infection.

Endoscopy. A tube (anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with a tiny camera at the tip is inserted into the anus to look for any problems in the anal canal or colon.

MRI defecography. Performed to assess the muscles and supporting structures in the anus, rectum and pelvis. Preferably done while the patient is moving bowels on a special commode.

Increase your calorie intake.,
Eat more often throughout the day.,
Reduce your cardio.,
Add in strength training.,
Find ways to reduce stress.",How to Stop Losing Weight1," One way you can stop losing weight is to increase the amount of calories you eat each day. You should consume at least 1200 calories each day. Try tracking your calorie intake each day using a calorie tracker app, and then add a couple hundred calories each day.This doesn’t mean you should start eating a bunch of junk food. Instead, eat healthy calories that provide a lot of nutrition. For example, you can eat nut and nut butters, which have healthy calories and fat. Try adding healthy oils, like coconut and olive, to your meals. Include healthy carbs, like quinoa and oatmeal.;
, If you are having trouble getting enough calories, try eating more small meals throughout the day. Large meals only once or twice a day may not provide enough calories for you, and they can make you feel stuffed and overly full.Try eating three meals, then small snacks between meals. You may also want to have small mini meals, like a protein and a vegetable, between your main meals.
For example, you may want to eat eggs, avocado, and a piece of fruit for breakfast. For a small snack, you may eat almond butter on a whole wheat English muffin. For your afternoon snack, you may eat some nitrate-free deli ham, cheese, and an apple. After dinner, you may eat Greek yogurt with frozen blueberries and walnuts.

, You shouldn’t stop working out completely, but adjusting your workout may help you stop losing weight. Assess what you are currently doing, how often you are working out, and for how long. Consider cutting back on long cardio workouts, or do cardio fewer days each week.Add in social workouts instead of hitting the gym each day. Go for walks with your family, friends, or dog, or plan a hiking trip with them. Play a team sport at the park, or go for a bike ride through a park.
Consider light workouts that help with stress, like yoga, tai chi, or pilates.

, Increase your strength training and reduce your cardio. Building muscle mass can help you gain muscle weight and stop losing weight from burning fat. Lifting heavy weights will help you gain muscle tissue, which will increase your weight.Switch from the treadmill or elliptical to doing bicep curls or lunges with dumbbells or barbell squats. If you've never worked out with weights before, consider talking to a personal trainer or a knowledgeable friend to help you learn proper form.

, High stress levels and anxiety can lead to weight loss. Stress and anxiety can lead you to stop eating, or your nervous energy may burn away calories. If stress is the root of your weight loss, you should find ways to reduce it to help your overall health.Try deep breathing exercises. For example, focus on your breathing twice each day. Take a minute or two and just breathe in and out calmly, focusing only on the way your breath feels as it enters and exits your body. You may want to breathe in for a count of four or five, hold it for that long, and then release for a count of five.
Guided meditation is another good relaxation technique. You can find apps, audio files, and YouTube channels that will lead you through guided meditations for stress.
Yoga and tai chi are great exercise for stress relief.

Beets have been found to help increase blood flow to the brain, which helps with concentration and memory.If your nose wrinkles at the thought, consider adding them to a smoothie.

, Both seafood and eggs (yolk and whites) are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have found that foods high in these fats help maintain memory and support overall brain health.Include both of these foods in your diet to help you focus.


Eggs also contain choline which some research suggests helps promote a healthy brain overall.Try adding variety to your egg dishes by having a frittata, quiche, an omelet, or deviled eggs.

For example, you might have tuna salad one day, oysters another, and salmon steaks another day.

, When you are using diet to help you focus it’s a good idea to get long lasting energy. You can do this by eating foods that are high in protein.Beans, eggs, white-meat poultry, and low-fat dairy are all a good source of protein.

Have a cup of black bean soup and a half of a chicken breast salad for your midday meal.

, Because they are digested more slowly, complex carbohydrates provide your body with long-term energy.This can help maintain your focus throughout the day.


Choose unrefined whole grains when picking your cereals, rice, and bread.

Even if they have very unhealthy eating habits or follow diet trends, don’t accuse them or make demands of them. Instead, share your concerns in a way that won’t offend them. For example, if you’re concerned about their weight, ask permission to bring it up.Treat them like adults and not infants. While you may not like their decisions, respect what they choose.;
, If you tell them all the things you think they do wrong or unhealthily, they may become defensive and not listen to you. Instead, talk about how their behavior impacts you and how you feel about it. They may not realize how their choices affect you and your family. Keep the focus on you and stay away from accusing them.For example, say, “I’ve noticed you’ve started losing weight and I am concerned about you. The thought of you not eating well or struggling to take care of yourself makes me sad.”

, Focus the conversation around your concern and love for your parents. Frame your concerns around your love for them and your desire for them to be in your life. If you feel like their eating habits threaten their life or longevity, say so in a loving way.For example, say, “I love you, and I want you to be a part of my life and my kids’ lives for a long time. The thought of your eating habits taking you earlier than necessary hurts me and I don’t want that to happen. I want to do whatever I can to keep you a part of my life for as long as possible.”

, When discussing your parent’s diet, avoid being judgmental in your speech. You want them to make healthy choices, but don’t try to guilt them into making changes. For example, if your parents are overweight, don’t shame or blame them, as they are probably aware that they are overweight and perhaps even embarrassed about it.Keep your discussion upbeat and helpful and not hurtful or blaming.

, Skip the lecture and aim to be relatable and give relevant information. Your parents need to see why it’s important to think about their diet and nutrition before they start making changes. Stay away from talking about their behaviors until they are open to hearing about alternatives.For example, bring up something you read in the news about health, diets, or nutrition and ask their thoughts about it.

, If you’re ready to talk and you think your parents may be at a place where they’re ready to listen, talk specifically about your concerns. Avoid using generalizations like, “You always eat fast food,” or, “I never see you eating healthily.” Instead, use specific examples such as, “It bothered me when the kids came over and they only ate junk food because that was all that was in the house.”For example, if your parents are on an unhealthy diet, say, “I’ve noticed you spend a lot of money and this and I’m concerned it’s not healthy for you. It worries me that it seems to affect your mood and is so costly.”

, Instead of telling your parents what they need, ask how you can help them. This can change the tone and show that you want to help them and not just criticize them or tell them what to do. It also allows them to make requests and say what they need. They may be struggling with something (like affording their medication) that may influence their behavior and eating habits.


For example, say, “Your diet concerns me and I want to help you be healthy. What do you need help with? Is there something I can do?”
If your parents are elderly, they may be struggling because they cannot prepare food on their own or buy food any more. If they are struggling to live independently, think about assisted living or hiring outside help., Make small requests of your parents instead of making big demands or asking for big changes.For example, if your parents eat fast food and you’d like them to cut down, ask them to eat out one less time each week. Encourage them to eat dinner with you or cook at home.


When your parents meet the small goals, they may be more willing to meet other goals and make larger changes over time.

, Fad diets often promise a lot and deliver very little or encourage unhealthy weight loss.If your parents are trying to lose weight by using a fad diet, talk to them about their dangers. For example, some diets restrict carbs or calories, so they might end up bingeing and consuming more calories than they would have otherwise. Say why you’re concerned about their diet and offer some suggestions.


For example, encourage them ways to lose weight safely and effectively.

, If you hesitate in knowing the words to say, let your actions speak louder. If you need some time to figure out what to say and want to avoid coming across as judgmental, model good eating. For example, invite your parents over for a healthy meal.Drop off a bag of fresh groceries or bring them food that is healthy and nourishing.

, Have your parents schedule regular medical checkups and stay on top of their medical care.For example, if your parents are losing weight too quickly or change their eating habits, have them talk it over with a physician. If they are on medications, it’s even more important for them to maintain a healthy diet. Attend appointments with your parents or help them schedule them.


Some older adults are more willing to listen to medical advice than advice from their children. You might want to say your concerns, then refer them to a physician.

, A great way to help your parents maintain a healthy diet is to invite them over to eat with you or offer to cook with them or for them. Especially if they are hesitant to make changes on their own, give them some assistance by participating in the process. For example, if they struggle to prepare healthy meals or have go-to options, bring over some food and show them how to prepare it. It can help to demystify healthy meals.Show your parents how to put together easy-to-prepare meals that they can do on their own.

, Encourage your parents to have healthy foods in the home. For instance, you can drop off some groceries for them that include healthy and easy meals for them to prepare. You might even want to drop off some recipes to go along with the food.Pack some meals and some snacks for your parents. If they have favorite foods, try out a healthier version. For example, if they enjoy hamburgers, have them try some vegetarian options.

, Put a limit to TV and computer or video game time. Show her that there are other fun stuff to do outside of the house and not just in the virtual world. Watch sports shows with her, and try enrolling her in swimming classes, baseball training and the like. If your child is exhibiting an interest in any one sport, take her up on it, and do not forget to follow-through – you have to show you’re as interested as she is so that she doesn’t lose her enthusiasm.

, Teach her not to dwell on failures and bad sides, but to focus on her good qualities instead. Teach her to have faith in her abilities, but do not be too emphatic or she might feel pressure. Set a harmonious balance between praise and criticism – do not overdo either. This sort of training will help prevent “comfort eating” in the future.

, You can hardly point your child in the right direction when it comes to healthy eating habits if you do not practice them yourself.

Submerge a metal spoon in ice water.,
Run the bottom of the spoon along the surface.,
Scoop away any excess.",How to Skim Fat Off Soup1," Fill a large mixing bowl with ice water, then dunk a large metal spoon in that water. Keep the spoon submerged for several minutes.


The ice water should be roughly one part ice and four parts water. Make sure that you prepare enough ice water to cover the entire spoon.
You must use a metal spoon for this method. The spoon must become very cold, and a plastic spoon will not become as cold as a metal spoon.;
, Run the bottom of the spoon cavity along the surface of the soup. Lift the spoon and discard any fat that has stuck to the bottom.


When the cold metal touches the hot soup, the fat that has gathered near the surface should quickly coagulate onto the spoon. Most of the partially hardened fat will remain stuck on the spoon, allowing you to remove it by merely lifting the spoon away., Any fat that falls away from the spoon can be scooped into the cavity of the spoon and discarded.


Hold the spoon at a slight angle so that only one edge can scrape across the surface of the soup. Drag this edge over the surface, peeling up as much fat and as little soup broth as possible in the process.

Choose lean sources of protein.,
Make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable.,
Go for folate-rich whole grains.,
Include calcium-rich dairy products.,
Drink adequate amounts of fluids.,
Consume adequate amounts of calcium.,
Monitor how much iron you consume.,
Ensure you're eating enough folate.,
Consume adequate amounts of vitamin D. Calcium and Vitamin D play an important role together.,
Be aware of how much soy you consume.,
Skip the processed junk foods.,
Limit alcohol.,
Limit or avoid unhealthy sources of fat.",How to Tailor Food Choices for Women's Health," Women need to ensure they're consuming an adequate amount of protein each day. Although women do not need as much protein as men, it's still an essential nutrient in your diet.


Women typically need about 40 – 60 grams of protein daily. You want to aim for about 0.8 grams of protein per kg of body weight.Needs increase during pregnancy and lactation and you may needs as much as 70 – 80 grams daily.Choose leaner sources of protein as these are naturally low in calories and unhealthy sources of fat (like saturated or trans fats). Try: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, tofu, beans and nuts or low-fat dairy products.
Protein like lean beef, beans, lean pork, poultry and seafood are good sources of iron and can help you make sure you meet your daily minimum of this essential nutrient.;
, Both fruits and vegetables are important food groups and will help make your diet balanced. In addition, they are the main sources of many essential nutrients to support a woman's body.Women typically need about four to six servings of these nutrient-dense foods each day. Generally, if you make half of your meals a fruit or vegetable, you'll meet this goal with ease.Make sure to measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens and 1/2 cup of fruit per serving.
Dark greens like spinach and kale are high in folate and calcium which is essential for women. Many fruits, like bananas, grapefruit and grapes are also high in folate.Opt for non-starchy vegetables (lettuce, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers and tomatoes) over starchy ones (corn, peas, parsnips, potatoes, pumpkin, squash, zucchini and yams). Non-starchy vegetables are usually more nutrient-dense and are lower in calories per serving.

, The grain food group is another important group for women. They offer a variety of nutrients and carbohydrates which are an essential form of energy.


It's typically recommended to go for 100% whole grains over refined grains (like white rice or white bread). Whole grains are high in fiber and other essential nutrients that are important for women's health.Measure out a 1/2 cup or 1 oz of 100% whole grains like: brown rice, millet, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread and pasta.Whole grains are some of the foods with the highest amount of folate which is needed in a woman's diet. In addition they're high in fiber which can promote a healthy GI system and prevent constipation during pregnancy., Dairy foods, like milk and yogurt, are an essential source of calcium in women's diets. Women should focus on consuming enough dairy and calcium to help maintain their health (especially their bone health).


Dairy foods are known for being high in calcium. In addition, many of these foods are also fairly high in Vitamin D. Both of these nutrients together play an important role in muscle function and more so with your bone health.Women should aim for two to three servings of calcium-rich dairy foods each day. Measure out 1 cup of milk or yogurt or about 1 – 2 ounces of cheese per serving.
Stick to lower fat dairy items like: low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt, low-fat cheese, low-fat cottage cheese or low-fat kefir.
Remember, too, that the mineral magnesium is essential to the absorption of calcium — if you are deficient in magnesium, you could still be deficient in calcium despite eating plenty of calcium-rich foods. Women need 310 — 360 mg of magnesium daily, depending on their age.

, Although not a nutrient per say, hydrating fluids are an essential part of a woman's diet. Make sure that you're drinking enough clear, hydrating fluids every day.


Most health professionals recommend that women drink at least nine glasses (8-oz each) of hydrating fluids each day; however, if you're pregnant or very active, you may need upwards of 13 glasses daily.Beverages like water or sparkling water, flavored water, decaf coffee or decaf tea will be the most hydrating, though regular coffee, milk, and even sodas all count toward your daily fluid intake.

, Calcium is an essential nutrient for all women, regardless of their age. All women need to monitor how much calcium they're consuming from their diet and from supplements.


Calcium plays an important role in women's bodies. It's important for muscle contraction and bone growth, development and density. Women are at a higher risk than men for developing osteopenia and osteoporosis as they age.If you are woman under the age of 30 years old, you should aim for a minimum of 1,000 mg of calcium each day. This could come from 3 servings of dairy a day or from a supplemental source.If you are between the ages of 30 – 65, aim for 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium daily. And again, this can come from your diet or a supplement.
Women over 65 years old who are not receiving hormone replacement therapy need about 1,500 mg of calcium daily. You may need a supplement in addition to your diet to meet this requirement.
Again, remember that you must also get 310 — 360 mg of magnesium each day to ensure the calcium is absorbed and used by your body.

, Like calcium, iron is another important nutrient for women. Women of child bearing age need to be the most vigilant with their iron intake.


Iron is essential for a variety of reason; however, most importantly, it's important for the formation of red blood cells. Inadequate iron intake, especially in women under the age of 50 – 55 years old can cause anemia.Women who are currently menstruating need at least 15 – 20 mg of Iron each day. A well balanced diet should be able to provide you with adequate amounts. However, taking a MVI can ensure you meet your daily recommendations.Women who are no longer menstruating due to menopause or a hysterectomy do not need as much iron. Generally about 10 mg daily will suffice., Folate is a very important nutrient for women. If you are of child-bearing age, you should be confident that you're consuming adequate folate each day.


Folate has many, many functions in the body including: aiding in the formation of red blood cells, aiding the process of making DNA and RNA, supporting the metabolism of carbohydrates into energy and supporting your nervous system.Folate is crucial for women intending to have children. Folate helps prevent neural tube and spinal defects in a fetus. When you do not consume adequate folate, your child could be born with birth defects.
Women who are of child bearing age, but are not pregnant should take 400 mg of folate daily. Women who are pregnant should take 500 – 800 mg daily and those who are breast feeding should consume at least 500 mg of folate per day.
Your diet is a great source of folate, but an extra supplement, especially during pregnancy, can help ensure you meet the daily recommended intakes.

, Not consuming adequate amounts of Vitamin D can have an effect on your body's calcium level and your immune system.


Consuming adequate Vitamin D from diet alone is difficult. Due to this, many people have Vitamin D deficiencies. However, Vitamin D is necessary for bone growth and maintenance, immune health and for muscle function.Women who do not consume adequate amounts of Vitamin D increase their risk for calcium resorption (calcium being leaked from your bones) which can lead to osteoporosis.
Since very few foods contain adequate Vitamin D, you may need to take a supplement. The only other source is the sun and that can be unreliable due to seasonal changes, time exposed to UV light and whether or not you're wearing clothing or sunscreen.
Most women regardless of age need between 600 – 800 IU of Vitamin D each day. This same guideline applies to women who are pregnant and breast feeding as well., Foods that are made from soy or soybeans or contain higher quantities of soy may not be something you choose to consume. There is a lot of research has gone back and forth on the ""soy debate"" and can make this decision confusing.


There have been studies linking soy to increased risk of breast cancer. Many of these studies have been with animals only. Thus, many scientists and health professionals do not agree that this same effect will happen in people. At this point, there is no conclusive evidence that clearly links the consumption of soy with increased breast cancer risk in women.
Limit your consumption of soy-based or containing foods to two to four servings per day. Serving sizes will vary depending on what type of soy product you're consuming.Soy products can be safely added to the diet for women who have cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown there may be some modest benefits when women with CVD consumed some soy in their diet.
Soy products in moderation, can also be consumed if you have breast cancer or have a genetic predisposition for developing breast cancer., Processed junk foods are items that all people should limit in their diets, but especially women. Try to limit how much of these high calorie snacks and foods you eat during the day.


Processed junk foods are not recommended due to their high calorie, fat, sugar and sodium content and low nutrient content. Eating large quantities of these items can increase your risk for high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease — top causes of death for women in the U.S.Processed foods to avoid include: chips, crackers, cookies, candy, sweetened beverages, cakes/pies, breakfast pastries, sugary cereals and pretzels.
If you're choosing to have one of these processed foods, make sure to follow the appropriate portion size and only have it occasionally. These do not cause harm in small amounts, but when eaten regularly or in larger quantities can cause more problems.

, Alcohol is an item that most people should limit in their diets. Women, specifically need to watch their total alcohol consumption so it doesn't adversely affect their health.


The effects of alcohol are much stronger in women than in men. It can increase your risk of breast cancer and brain damage.If women drink alcohol while they're pregnant, the significantly increase the risk of damaging the fetus and causing harmful birth defects.Women should not drink more than one serving of alcohol per day. One serving is equivalent to 12 oz of beer (5% alcohol), 5 oz of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of hard liquor (40% alcohol).Try to keep your average under one drink per day.

, Since heart disease is one of the top causes of death for women, you want to make sure you avoid the types of fat that may increase your risk for developing any type of heart disease.


Saturated fats have been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. They have been shown to increase your LDL (the bad cholesterol) and may increase your risk for heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke.Saturated fats should be limited in your diet to less than 7% of your total daily calories. Limit foods like: full-fat dairy, fatty cuts of beef, lamb or pork, poultry skin and lard.
Trans fats are another type of unhealthy fat that you should aim to completely avoid. They have been directly linked to an increase in LDL and a decrease in HDL (the good cholesterol).Women in particular need to discontinue eating foods that contain trans fats.
Trans fats are typically found in foods like: margarine; non-dairy creamer; frozen and refrigerated doughs (like pie crust, biscuits or cinnamon rolls); crackers; cookies; pastries and frozen pizzas. Trans fats usually appear as ""partially hydrogenated oil"" on an ingredient list.

Eat probiotic yogurt.,
Bathe twice a day.,
Use clean towels.,

Avoid certain skin products.",How to Stop a Developing Yeast Infection1," There is a type of yogurt that has helpful bacteria in it that can help combat developing yeast infections. Yogurt with lactobacillus acidophilus has been used by women, either orally or applied vaginally, to help combat developing yeast infections. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a good bacteria that can help you to fight the bacteria causing your yeast infection. You can buy this kind of yogurt at most grocery stores. Make sure to check the label to ensure that it has active and live lactobacillus acidophilus cultures in it.


Studies have shown that yogurt may be effective at decreasing symptomatic relief in some women. However, as other studies have shown, it isn't effective in all women.;
, While taking a shower or bath two times a day can throw off your daily schedule, it is important that you stay as clean as possible to combat your yeast infection. When you bathe, do not use any chemical soap or body wash. These kinds of soaps can kill good bacteria that you need to fight your infection, while doing very little to reduce your infection.Women with vaginal yeast infections should take baths rather than showers. Taking a bath can help to clear yeast from the vaginal area.
Make sure your bath isn't too hot. This can cause yeast to multiply., When you bathe, go swimming, or dry off with a towel, it is important that you dry off as thoroughly as possible. Yeast thrives in warm, damp places, so use a clean, dry towel to get rid of any lingering moisture. If you use a towel that you used before, you might transfer yeast to it, which can thrive on the dampness left behind from your previous shower. Instead, wash your towels after you have used them once., If you have a skin or vaginal yeast infection, it is important to wear loose-fitting clothes that will allow your skin to breath. This is particularly important if you have a vaginal yeast infection. Wear cotton underwear and avoid any underwear made with silk or nylon, as these two fabrics do not let any air through.


Avoid activities that cause unnecessary heat, sweat, and moisture in affected areas in order to help prevent further growth of the yeast., When you are getting a yeast infection, avoid using any products that might make the infection worse. In particular, it is important to avoid soaps that could wash away good bacteria, as well as feminine hygiene sprays or powders. You should also not use certain lotions, since they can keep your skin moist and cause the skin to retain heat and liquid.


While you may want to use sprays or powders to combat some of the side effects of yeast infections, these products can actually irritate the skin further."

Cover the soup.,
Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.Place the covered stockpot of soup in the refrigerator and chill it overnight, or a minimum of 6 hours.,
Lift away the solidified fat.",How to Skim Fat Off Soup2," Remove the soup from the heat source and place a lid on the stockpot. Allow it to sit for 10 to 20 minutes at room temperature.


Make sure that none of the ingredients in the soup will spoil if left out at room temperature for a prolonged period of time. Soups that contain dairy and meat, for instance, may not be able to remain out as long as those that only contain broth or a few vegetables.
Note that this method does require a lot of time, so it won't be suitable if you need soup on the table within the hour. It can be a great method to use if you are preparing soup a day or more in advance, though.

,


Once the soup chills completely, the fat at the surface will solidify into larger, firmer chunks.

, Glide a large metal spoon underneath the solid pieces of fat and carefully lift them out. Discard the fat and reserve the lean soup.


After removing the fat, you can reheat the soup on the stove or in a microwave before serving it.

"
"
Move the stockpot halfway off the burner.,
Spoon away the fat.,
Repeat every 15 minutes.",How to Skim Fat Off Soup3," Shift the stockpot so that half of it remains on burner and half of it hangs over the edge.Consider placing an upside-down heat-resistant plate or pie dish beneath the overhanging edge of the pot to prevent the pot from tipping over.

, Carefully glide a large metal spoon underneath the fat that gathers over the side of the soup removed from the heat.


Fat and other impurities will naturally gather at the coolest spot, so after a few minutes, you should notice most of the fat shifting to the side that has been tilted away from the heat.
Tilt the pan slightly toward the burner as you skim to reduce the amount of broth you spoon away with the fat.

, After skimming away as much fat as possible, readjust the stockpot so that it sits over the heat evenly again. Repeat the same skimming process every 15 minutes or so throughout the rest of the cooking process.

Dip a ladle in the soup.,
Swirl the soup outward.,
Spoon away the fat.",How to Skim Fat Off Soup4," Submerge a long-handled ladle into the center of the stockpot. The bottom of the ladle should touch the bottom of the pot.

, Spin the ladle around the soup in a spiral pattern, working from the center of the stockpot out toward the edge.


You should notice foam and other fat gathering around the edge of the pot as you swirl the ladle around.

, Use the cavity of the ladle to spoon away the fat gathered along the edge of the stockpot.


Hold the ladle at a slight angle and submerge it so that the rim just barely falls beneath the surface of the liquid. Skim along the surface, picking up as much fat as possible. Some liquid will also be lost in the ladle, but if you work carefully, it shouldn't be much.

Pour the soup into the pitcher.,
Let it stand for several minutes.,
Pour the soup back into the stockpot.",How to Skim Fat Off Soup5," Remove the stockpot of soup from the heat source and carefully pour the soup into a special fat-separating pitcher.


Note that a ""gravy separator"" is essentially the same thing as a ""fat-separating pitcher."" Either pitcher will look like a large measuring cup with a spout extending out from the bottom.
Since this method relies on the use of a strainer built into the pitcher, it will only work for broths and liquids. Soups that contain pieces of rice, pasta, vegetable, or meat will not work since these solid chunks of food would be strained out along with the fat.

, Set the pitcher aside for 5 minutes or so. During this time, most of the fat should rise to the top of the soup.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on the amount of fat in your soup. Watch closely and wait until you see a visible layer of fat forming at the top of the pitcher before proceeding to the next step., Carefully pour the soup back into the stockpot or into a serving bowl. The liquid should pass through the spout and the fat should remain trapped inside the pitcher.

See your doctor if your symptoms do not improve.,
Allow your doctor to run tests.,
Discuss your treatment options.",How to Treat a Yeast Infection Naturally3," If you notice your symptoms are getting worse, despite home treatment, you should see your doctor. This is especially important if you are pregnant or if you are experiencing a yeast infection for the first time. You should also see your doctor if you are not sure if you have a yeast infection or you develop other symptoms that may indicate another medical issue.If you have a non-complicated yeast infection, you may experience itching and irritation in your vagina and/or the tissues at the vaginal opening, known as your vulva. You may also have a burning sensation when you urinate or have sex. You may notice a thick, white, odor-less discharge in your vagina.
If you have a complicated yeast infection, you may experience more severe symptoms, such as swelling and itching of the vagina that causes tears, cracks or sores in your vagina. You may also notice that you get four or more yeast infections a year.

, Once you see your doctor, you may have to answer a series of questions about your medical history and how long you have been experiencing the symptoms of a yeast infection. Your doctor will then do a pelvic exam to look for signs of infection. During the exam, they may place a speculum into your vagina to examine your vagina and cervix.Your doctor may also take a sample of your vaginal fluid and get it tested to determine the type of fungus that is causing your yeast infection.
Your doctor may ask you about your vaginal health habits, such as whether you douche your vagina and if you have ever been treated for a vaginal health issue before. You should ask your doctor about ways you can prevent a yeast infection in the future.

, Your doctor will recommend certain treatments for your infection based on your symptoms. If you have a non-complicated yeast infection, your doctor may prescribe anti-fungal medication in the form of a cream, an ointment, a tablet, or a suppository. You may need to use the medication for one to seven days to help clear up the yeast infection.Your doctor may also recommend a single-dose oral medication or an over-the-counter treatment for your yeast infection. Single oral dose medication can help clear up the yeast infection within a few days. OTC creams and suppositories can often be used during pregnancy and will clear up the infection within three to seven days.
If you have a complicated yeast infection, with severe symptoms, your doctor may recommend long-course vaginal therapy, where you use medication in the form of a cream, an ointment, a tablet or a suppository for seven to 14 days.

Using soap or other substances can disrupt the natural pH levels in your vagina.You should try to get in the habit of showering and washing your vaginal area after you have had sexual intercourse to prevent someone else’s bacterial from sitting in your vagina.

, Wearing underwear that is made of a breathable material like cotton can help to prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria in your vagina. Avoid underwear made of synthetic materials and try not to wear panty hose or tight jeans. You should also change out of wet swimsuits and sweaty gym clothes right away.If possible, you should try to go commando, or without underwear, when you can. Wearing a long skirt with no underwear can let air get into your vagina and reduce your risk of yeast infections.

, Using birth control that is estrogen-based, such as combination birth control pills, can lead to a higher amount of yeast in your vagina and make you more prone to infections. You may opt for non-estrogen methods like progestin-only mini pills or an intrauterine device (IUD).If you use condoms as your birth control method, go for condoms that do not contain spermicides, as they can irritate your vagina. You should also use a lubricant that is water-based during sex to prevent friction or irritation, as this can disrupt the ecology of your vagina.

Use medication on your skin.,
Treat a vaginal yeast infection.,
Ask your doctor about boric acid.,
Stop oral yeast infections with medical mouthwash.",How to Stop a Developing Yeast Infection2," There are certain medications that can help combat a yeast infection on your skin. For skin infections, doctors generally recommend antifungal creams that are applied directly to the affected area. These creams will generally clear the infection within a couple of week. The two most common antifungal creams for yeast infections on the skin include miconazole and oxiconazole. The cream have general instructions for application, but make sure you follow the doctor's instructions carefully.


To use cream for your skin yeast infections, wash the affected area with water and then dry it off very thoroughly. The skin should not be moist at all. Apply the recommended amount of cream as indicated by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. Let it absorb into your skin before you reapply clothing or do any activities that might cause the area to rub against another object or material. , To fight a vaginal yeast infection, you can get over the counter medications or get a prescription from your doctor. For infrequent episodes of yeast infections that only have mild to moderate symptoms, you can use over the counter medication that either comes as a cream, tablet, or suppository that gets inserted directly into your vagina.The common yeast-fighting medical creams include miconazole (Monistat) and terconazole (Terazol). They are generally used as a cream or suppository, given intravaginally every day at bedtime, for as many days as specified in the instructions. You can get medications that last one to seven days.
You can also get oral antifungal medication that can be taken, such as clotrimazole (Myecelex) and fluconazole (Diflucan), which you take by mouth.
You can also take clotrimazole as tablets, which are taken intravaginally at 100mg every day at bedtime for six to seven days, 200mg every night for 3 days, or 500mg daily for 1 day.Some yeast infections may be more complicated. These have to be treated for seven to 14 days, rather than one to seven days.

, Boric acid is available for yeast infections as a vaginal insert suppository by a prescription. This may provide relief from infections that occur frequently if conventional treatments have not been as effective as expected. Additionally, boric acid may provide increased resistance against other strains of candida that may have become resistant to certain antibiotics over time.


Boric acid is toxic, especially to children when ingested, and can cause irritation to skin.Abstain from oral sex while using boric acid so your partner does not ingest the toxic acid.

, If you develop a mouth yeast infection, you can combat it with medical mouthwash with antifungal capabilities. To use this medication, you swish it around in your mouth for a short time and then swallow it. The medicine helps the surface of your mouth as well as from inside your body after you swallow it. Also talk to a doctor about additional prescription oral medications that you can take. Oral antifungal medications also come in the form of tablets and lozenges.


If you have a very weakened immune system and are combating other illnesses like cancer or HIV, your doctor may also prescribe Amphotericin B, a medication that combats oral yeast infections that have become immune to antifungal medications."

Recognize the signs.,
Consider the general risk factors.,
Look for the gender specific risk factors.,
Reduce the possibility of a yeast infection.",How to Stop a Developing Yeast Infection3," If you want to prevent a developing yeast infection, you need to be able to recognize the signs of one. There are three types of yeast infections. There are infections that affect the skin, the mouth, and the vagina.


Symptoms of a mouth yeast infection, also called oral thrush, are creamy patches of white in the throat or mouth region or painful cracks at the corners of your lips.
Skin yeast infections cause blisters, red patches of skin, or skin rashes, which are most commonly found between the toes and fingers, under the breast, and around the groin area.Skin yeast infections can also affect the penis. The symptoms can be the same, but the penis can also develop white patches of skin or moist areas of skin with a white substance collecting in skin folds.Vaginal yeast infections are common, and causes increased vaginal discharge that may be thick, white, and curd-like, mild to moderate itching, and internal vaginal skin irritation and redness.

, There are many risk factors that can contribute to yeast infections. If you suffer from a disorder that compromises the immune system, such as HIV, it will open up increased possibilities for infection because the body is unable to properly defend itself against outside sources. If you are taking antibiotics, you are also more likely to get a yeast infection. Antibacterial therapies, such as antibiotics, serve to fight against inspections, but they can also reduce the number of bacteria that live on your body and play a role in protecting you from other types of infections, such as yeast infections. In these cases, a yeast infection may occur if it is provided a surface to effectively multiply on, such as the skin, penis, or vagina.


People who are overweight can also suffer from increased changes of yeast infections. This is typically due to the overabundance of skin folds, which can cause bacteria and yeast growth.Babies are also prone to yeast infections that present as diaper rashes or in the mouth., Women with hormonal fluctuations, due to menopause, birth control pills, pregnancy, or premenstrual syndrome, can be more susceptible to yeast infections because of the physical stressors the hormonal changes cause. Women may also be prone to yeast infections through the use of douches and chemical irritants. While well-intentioned, these can alter the natural pH balance of the vagina, which naturally creates an environment that is difficult for foreign bacteria to infect.


Men are more prone to yeast infections if they are uncircumcised. These men have an increased risk for the yeast bacteria that causes the infections due to the increased ability of bacteria to grow on or under the foreskin., There are general ways you can prevent yeast infections. Only use antibiotics when absolutely necessary, so your body keeps its natural bacteria that fights off yeast infections.Since steroids can cause immune system problems, reduce or minimize the use of inhaled and other steroids. Try to stay away from moist environments and clothes. If you are in moist clothes, try to change out of them as soon as possible.Yeast infections can grow in the mouth, especially in those with diabetes and those with dentures. To prevent this issue with dentures, keep your dentures clean and use well-fitting dentures. For other instances, the yeast will remain dormant until a trigger, such as antibiotic use, causes it to manifest.Women should avoid douching if at all possible.If you have diabetes, always do your best to keep it controlled and keep your skin healthy."

Know when to contact your doctor.",How to Remove a Dead Toenail," Dead toenails are often created when blisters (often blood blisters) develop beneath the nail. The blister causes the skin underneath the nail to die, and once that skin dies, the nail separates and lifts away from the toe.If your toenail has died for another reason, including a fungal infection, there will likely be no blister to drain. Skip directly to the ""Removing the Toenail"" section of this article and follow the same removal and aftercare procedure. In the case of a fungal infection, visit your doctor, who can prescribe a suitable antifungal cream.
Do not attempt to drain a blister underneath your nail if you suffer from diabetes, have peripheral arterial disease, or have any problems with your immune system.These scenarios can result in long term hard to treat infection and wounds not healing appropriately due to decreased immune system and lack of blood flow for healing. In this case, you must consult your physician.;
, You should thoroughly wash the toe and nail area with soap and water. Wash your hands with soap and water, as well. It is critical that you make your toe and hands as sterile as possible before attempting to pierce your blister or remove you toenail. If there is bacteria present, you are placing yourself at risk of infection.


You may want to consider swabbing the toenail and surrounding area with iodine.Iodine has been shown to kill the bacteria that causes infection., Wipe a clean, sharp pin, needle, or end of a paperclip with rubbing alcohol in order to sterilize it. Heat the tip of the sharp object of your choosing in a flame until it is visibly red-hot.To best avoid infection, this process should be done with supervision by medical professional. Any time you attempt a medical procedure at home — even the simplest procedure — you put yourself at risk for infection or making a painful or dangerous mistake. Consider visiting your doctor or an urgent care clinic to remove your toenail instead of doing it yourself.
Note that a blunt metal paper clip can be used instead of a pin if you feel uneasy about piercing the blister with a sharp point. If you have never tried to drain a blister, using a paperclip might be a safer option; however, have a sterilized pin on hand as you may need it to pierce the blister.
Only heat the tip of the pin. The rest of the pin will become warm, but only the tip should become red-hot. Be careful not to burn your fingers while handling it.

, Position the heated tip of the pin over the nail, just above the blister. Hold it still and allow the heat to melt a hole through the nail.If you can access your blister by inserting the pin under the tip of your nail, you will not have to worry about melting through your nail. You can then just drain the nail by piercing the blister with the tip of the hot pin.
Since there are no nerves in a nail, using a hot pin to melt it should not cause any pain. You should avoid applying pressure when melting your nail, as you want to be careful not to burn the skin underneath.Depending on the thickness of your nail, you may need to reheat the pin several times and repeat the melting at the same spot on your nail each time.

, After creating a hole in the nail, use the tip of the pin to puncture the blister. Allow the fluid to drain out.


In order to minimize any pain or discomfort, you may want to allow the pin to cool slightly to a tolerable temperature before using it to pierce the blister.
If possible, try to pierce the blister at a point somewhere around the blister's outer edge. Leave as much of the overlying skin alone as possible. Never pick at the skin with your hands, as this is a gateway for infection.

, Immediately after draining the blister, soak the toe in warm and slightly soapy water for approximately 10 minutes. After that, continue to soak the toe in soapy water for 10 minutes, three times a day, until the blister fully heals. After you soak, apply an antibiotic ointment or blister ointment and bandage the toe using clean gauze and a bandage.This will help prevent infection.


Depending on the size and severity of your blister you might need to drain your blister multiple times until all the fluid is completely gone. Try to drain any remaining fluid from the blister from the same hole you previously created in your nail.

, Before attempting to remove part or all of the toenail, clean the toe with warm, soapy water. Dry it well before continuing. Cleaning your foot, toe, and nail area as well as possible before any toenail removal will help to prevent infection. In addition to your foot, clean your hands to lessen the chance of transmitting bacteria.

, Clip the portion of your nail that is resting on dead skin away. This makes it more difficult for dirt and bacteria to become lodged beneath the dead nail.Removing the nail will also help the skin beneath the nail to heal faster.


To minimize the risk of infection, you may want to sterilize the clippers with rubbing alcohol before use. Sharp nail clippers are also better to use than blunt nail clippers since the latter may tear the nail as you attempt to remove it.

, If the nail has already started dying, you should be able to pull a portion away from your skin without difficulty. The portion you can pry away without feeling any pain is the part that you will want to clip off.

, After removing the top portion of the nail, wrap the toe with a nonstick gauze bandage, adhesive bandages. Your newly exposed skin will probably be raw and tender, so wrapping your toe will help to minimize the discomfort that you may feel. You may also want to apply antibiotic ointment to the skin to encourage healing and reduce the risk of any infection.

, While every situation is unique, you should generally wait a few days before removing the rest of the nail (it may be best to wait between two to five days).The nail will slowly die and become much less painful to remove after a few days of waiting.


While waiting for the bottom part of your nail to die so that you can remove it, you will want to keep the nail area as clean as possible. This can mean gently washing it with soap and water, using antibiotic ointment, and keeping it loosely dressed with a gauze bandage.

, Once the rest of the nail has died, grab the last piece and remove it in one motion, pulling from left to right.Once you start pulling away the nail, you will recognize if it is ready to be removed. If you feel pain, stop pulling.


You may see some bleeding if your nail is still connected at the corner of your cuticle; however, this pain should not be severe.

, Once you remove the remainder of the nail and expose the raw skin, it will be important to clean the toe with warm water and some gentle soap. In addition, you should try to apply an antibiotic ointment and loosely bandage the toe.Remember that this is a wound, and you must treat it gently until a new layer of skin grows.

, While you are watching TV with your feet up is a good time to remove the bandage and expose your toe to the air. However, if you are going to be walking around city streets or through a park (particularly with open-toed shoes on), you will want to keep your toe bandaged.


Change the bandage each time you clean the wound. You should also change it any time the bandage gets dirty or wet.

, Apply an antibiotic ointment or cream to the wound at least once a day to help stave off infection. Continue until new skin grows over it. An over-the-counter cream will suffice in most situations, but you may need a prescription cream prescribed by your doctor if you get an infection.

, Rest your foot as much as possible for the first few days after removing the nail, especially since it will probably be quite painful at this point. Once the pain and swelling go down, you can gradually ease yourself back into your normal routine, including exercise. However, you should not push yourself to do something that causes pain.


If possible, keep your foot elevated when you sit or lie down. Prop it up so that it's above the level or your heart. This can help minimize any swelling and pain you may experience.While the nail is growing, avoid wearing narrow or tight shoes that may cause trauma to the nailWear closed toe shoes as much as possible to further protect the nail bed as it recovers, especially when you are doing physical activities outside.

, Symptoms such as severe pain can be a sign of infection. Other common signs of infection include swelling, warmth around the toe, drainage of pus from the toe, red streaks extending out from the wound, or fever.Don’t wait until the infection becomes serious- contact your doctor at your first inclination that something may not be right.

Drink enough water every day to fill yourself up.The Mayo Clinic recommends that adult women drink 9 cups of water per day, and men 13 cups per day.Not only does this keep your body hydrated and healthy — it also prevents your body from confusing thirst with hunger.,
Replace caloric drinks with water.One of the easiest ways to cut large amounts of calories from your diet is to stop drinking your calories.,
Embrace coffee and tea.,
Flavor your water with fruits.,
Take sips of water between bites during meals.,
Drink water before and during exercise.",How to Lose Belly Fat by Drinking Water1," If you drink enough water to fill up your stomach, you can trick your body the other way, into thinking it’s full of food when it’s really full of zero-calorie water.


Remember that these amounts are general guidelines and the amount of water required will vary based on your weight and activity level.
Keep a water bottle with you so you can sip on water throughout the day.
Know how many ounces of water your bottle holds, and make sure you refill it enough times in a day to reach your water goals.
If you’re feeling hungry, drink a glass of water and wait 10 minutes. If you’re still feeling hungry, eat a light snack. You’ll often find, though, that a glass of water can stave off snack cravings.;
, The energy drink you use to get your day started, the soda you drink with lunch, and the beers you grab with friends at the end of the workday — those are all empty calories added on top of the actual food you eat.


A couple alcoholic drinks with friends might be an important part of your social life. Just make sure you don’t drink to excess. Have water while you’re drinking, both to keep your body hydrated and to keep you from drinking too many alcoholic calories. Aim for a one-to-one ratio of alcoholic drinks to glasses of water.

, If you’re one of the many people who has trouble getting started in the morning, don’t worry! Experts count coffee and tea as part of your daily water intake.If you’ve relied on energy drinks in the past, these unadorned caffeinated drinks are a much better way to wake yourself up.


Don’t add calories to these drinks with unnecessary additions. A caramel latte or Frappuccino will be full of added sugar and calories from milk, whipped cream, and flavoring syrups. A plain cup of coffee, on the other hand, has only 2 calories and no fat!Be aware that your body must still metabolize the caffeine, which requires water. Make sure you drink enough water to allow your metabolism to do so.

, If you find yourself missing the flavored drinks you once used to tide you over, you can make your own flavored drinks without the sugar and calories. Slice up your favorite fruits — strawberries, lemons, cucumbers — and soak them in a pitcher of water in your refrigerator. After a few hours, the water will take on the fruit’s flavor, and you’ll have a delicious, low-calorie drink.

, Water helps you digest meals by ensuring proper kidney function.But taking sips of water in between bites can also stop you from overeating. It can take 12-20 minutes for your body to realize that its hunger has been satisfied, so if you’re eating too fast, you may eat far more than you need to.Fast eaters often find that they feel overly full and sluggish after meals. By sipping on water between every bite, you lengthen the meal and give your brain time to process how full your stomach is.

, Research shows that drinking water can raise your metabolic rate, allowing your body to burn calories at a slightly higher rate than normal.While the metabolic increase isn’t staggering, it is significant, and it’s easy! Researchers estimate that if you increase your daily water intake by about 6 cups per day, you could lose an extra 5 pounds over the course of a year.


Make sure you are drinking enough water to replenish what you sweat out during exercise. Failure to to do so may cause dehydration, which leads to a multitude of health risks.

Understand that water fasting does not yield permanent results.,
Consider the health limitations of water fasting.The human body is incredibly resilient, and can last a long time without food — so long as it’s not dehydrated.Fasting for a few days is not harmful to most people as long as they drink plenty of water — which you’ll want to do anyway to trick your stomach into thinking you’ve eaten something.,
Fast only for a few days.,
Fast during a stress-free stretch of days.,
Break your fast before the event you’re preparing for.",How to Lose Belly Fat by Drinking Water2," A water fast is when a person does not eat or drink anything but water for a set period of time. This obviously results in rapid weight loss because your body is not taking in any calories through food. However, the weight you lose through fasting will come back when you start eating again. In fact, because your metabolism slows down to deal with the lack of energy coming in through food, you may gain back more weight than you lost in the first place when you start eating again.If you’re trying to lose permanent weight, you should drink plenty of water in concert with balanced meals and regular exercise.
However, if you need to drop a few pounds for an event, a water fast might be a quick solution for you.

,


However, people with some medical conditions should not fast under any circumstances. Diabetics, for example, need to regulate their blood sugar with food throughout the day. Consult your doctor before beginning a fast.
Children, the elderly, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and people with chronic illness should not fast.
Even otherwise healthy people will feel negative side effects while fasting. When you stop eating, your body doesn’t have an energy source; as a result, you will feel fatigue and dizziness. You may also feel nausea or suffer from constipation, and, obviously, you will feel very hungry.
You may want to consider a clean eating cleanse instead. Focus on eating lean proteins, vegetables, fruit, nuts (i.e. almonds and cashews), and complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and quinoa, for at least 48 hours.

, You may see recommendations for 21 or 30-day fasts online, but these are extremely dangerous if not under direct medical supervision. If you choose to fast, do so only for the three or four days before the event for which you’re preparing. Beyond that, you will be so fatigued and dizzy that you may hurt yourself or others just going about your daily life., If you have a big deadline coming up at work, or you’re going to be taking a road trip, you shouldn’t fast. The side effects will impede your ability to concentrate, and you’ll end up doing a bad job or being dangerous behind the wheel of a car.


Don’t try to exercise while fasting, either, as you have no excess calories to burn off. It will only make you feel terrible! Ideally, you should have a stress-free, low-energy stretch of days during which you can lay about.

, You want to look great on that day, not nauseous, tired, and dizzy! Don’t rush back into fatty foods immediately, as they can cause digestive problems after a fast. Instead, eat healthy, low-fat foods like fruits and vegetables to get you back on track for your big day.

Look for white lesions in the mouth.These lesions (a catch-all term for damaged or abnormal tissue) are plaque-like because they are raised and can be in various sizes or come together to cover larger areas.,
Look for dryness around the mouth.If the corners of your mouth are red, irritated, or cracked and bleeding, you might have oral thrush.,
Stay alert for unusual oral sensations.Individuals with oral thrush might develop a salty, bitter, metallic, or acidic taste in their mouths.,
Look for difficulty swallowing.If oral thrush has spread to the throat or esophagus you might have a hard time swallowing.,
Stay alert if you experience pain during breastfeeding.,
Identify individuals who are at a higher risk of developing oral thrush.Certain groups, due to their weakened immune systems, are more susceptible to developing thrush.",How to Recognize Thrush Symptoms (Oropharyngeal Candidiasis)1," The lesions are typically white and look like cottage cheese, though they might also be red and raw-looking. They might be located on your tongue, gums, tonsils, inner cheeks, or on the roof of your mouth. They will probably be quite swollen and might bleed if rubbed or scraped.


Lesions are the primary indicator that you have oral thrush. Aside from lesions, there are often no other symptoms.;
, You might also feel as if you have a cotton ball inside your mouth.


This phenomenon is known as angular cheilitis.

, Alternately, you might feel as though your mouth is being burned by scalding water. You might also lose your sense of taste entirely if you have oral thrush.

, Food might get stuck in your throat, causing you to choke. You might also have a sore throat and a raspy voice.

, If you are a breastfeeding mother and your child has oral thrush, your child might spread candida to your breasts. If your breasts are red, sensitive, itchy, or cracked, you and your child might have candida. You might also notice the skin of the areola is shiny or flaky. Finally, a high level of pain concentrated on the nipples could indicate thrush.If your child is unusually fussy or whiny, or has trouble feeding, it might have oral thrush.
Check for oral thrush in babies by looking for lesions in the mouth.
Oral thrush is quite common in babies. If your baby has thrush, you can continue breast feeding. You can also apply the same medication that pediatrician prescribes for your baby onto your nipples until the lesions are cleared.

Watch our for flu-like symptoms.,
Be on the lookout for more severe infections.,
Be wary of lung infections.",How to Recognize and Prevent Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)1," Mild infections of Valley Fever often go unrecognized because they manifest themselves much like other common and seasonal illnesses. However, if you have been in an endemic area, you should pay attention to any early symptoms in order to avoid contracting a more serious form of the disease.


The earliest symptoms of Valley Fever include fever, headaches, a persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, chills, night sweats, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and red bumpy rashes, especially on the upper body or legs.;
, If your Valley Fever goes untreated, the symptoms can become more severe, and the infection can cause chronic pneumonia. If you have been experiencing a constant fever, persistent chest pains and coughing, and weight loss, you should go to the doctor immediately.Another telling symptom of a developing infection is coughing up mucus tinged with blood, which may indicate that you have nodules in your lungs.

, In its most dangerous and advanced stages, Valley Fever can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and nervous system. At this point, you should already be in contact with your doctor, who can help you navigate these more severe symptoms.In its most serious “disseminated” form, Valley Fever will lead to skin sores, lesions in the skull and spine, bone and joint infections, and meningitis--an infection that affects the fluid and membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord.

Keep a food diary.,
Calculate your calorie needs.,
Transition to the DASH diet gradually.,
Consult the NIH guide to the DASH diet.",How to Lose Weight With the DASH Diet1," In it, record your current daily eating habits. Write down what you eat for every meal of the day, and take note if you skip a meal. If you regularly skip breakfast, jot this down as well. Also write down any snacks you eat, even if you do this mindlessly - say, while watching TV. This diary will allow you to see where you stand right now in terms of eating practices and where you can start to make changes., You can do this by determining your physical activity level. If your plan is to lose weight, you will need to eat fewer calories than you burn or burn more calories than you eat by staying physically active. Visit the NIH DASH Eating Plan website at for a helpful chart to help determine your daily calorie needs.


For example, a 35 year old male with a moderate activity level will need between 2,400-2,600 calories per day, whereas a 55 year old woman with a sedentary lifestyle will need about 1,600 calories daily., Changing too much at once can be destabilizing and can make you crave your old diet, leading to rebounds. Slow changes, on the other hand, will be barely noticeable, so pace yourself as you adapt your diet and you won’t even notice a thing - you’ll just reap the healthy benefits., Do this prior to starting on the diet so that you know what to expect and can prepare your meals accordingly.

Rinse your mouth after taking asthma medication.If you take corticosteroids -- for instance, through an asthma inhaler -- you are at greater risk for oral thrush than the mainstream population.,
Maintain excellent dental hygiene.,
Make careful dietary choices.Certain foods might lead to an increase in your likelihood to develop a candida infection.,
Keep your dentures clean.,
Treat vaginal yeast infections.If you are pregnant, you could pass oral thrush onto your child if you suffer from vaginal yeast infections.",How to Recognize Thrush Symptoms (Oropharyngeal Candidiasis)2," You can reduce this risk by swishing clean water in your mouth for about five seconds after taking your medication, then spitting it out.

, Brush at least twice each day with a fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush.Do not hold your brush in such a way that the bristles are directly perpendicular to the surface of the teeth. Instead, angle the bristles slightly toward the gums. Rinse your toothbrush after use and keep it in an upright position somewhere clean.


Toothbrush containers are useful for ensuring your toothbrush dries and stays clean.
Visit your dentist regularly. You should see your dentist at least twice each year.

, Avoid sugary foods and foods with a high content of yeast. Beer, soda, candy, baked goods, and bread should be avoided.


Additionally, keep your blood sugar within normal levels. If you have diabetes, take extra care to regulate your blood-sugar levels by consuming no more added sugar than is recommended. Blood sugar levels above the norm can lead to an increase in candida.

, Dentures make you a likely candidate for oral thrush. About one in four individuals with complete dentures encounter oral thrush at some point.If you have dentures, ensure you keep them clean using denture cleaning solvent each night. Disinfect the denture before inserting it in your mouth by dipping it in boric acid (a powerful antibacterial agent) or a 10% bleach solution mixed with water. Rinse the denture with water after using either of these disinfection methods.

, See a doctor If you have symptoms of a yeast infection. Your doctor will give you a prescription for the infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include:

What is the best treatment for this illness?
Are treatments generally successful?
Are there any side effects of treatment?

, The first step in fighting oral thrush is to see a doctor. The doctor will probably be able to identify thrush with a simple visual examination of your throat, but he or she may need to scrape throat tissue with a cotton swab and examine the tissue under a microscope.Other examinations might include:


A blood test, in which your blood is drawn and then analyzed for related conditions like abnormally high blood sugar.
An endoscopic exam. If you have extensive disease or if it is difficult to treat, then you might be referred to an ENT doctor who can do a limited scope of your mouth and throat or to a gastroenterologist who would do a scope of your esophagus and stomach.

, Medication prescribed by a qualified medical doctor is the standard treatment.Your doctor might prescribe pills, a medicated mouthwash solution, or antifungal lozenges.


Take your medication exactly as prescribed. If you do not treat your oral thrush properly, the condition could develop into invasive candidiasis, a fungal infection that occurs when the fungus enters the blood. Once it becomes blood-borne, the infection will spread throughout the body.
Contact your doctor if your oral thrush is not responding to treatment. You may need to get a fungal culture to find out more about the specific nature of the candida fungus you’re infected with.

Find out if you’ve been in an endemic area.,
Assess your exposure to infected soils.,
Check if you’re part of a high-risk group.,
Find out if you’ve had previous exposure to Valley Fever.,
Check for common diseases or outbreaks.",How to Recognize and Prevent Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)2," The fungus that causes Valley Fever can be found in the soils of the southwestern United States. It’s also present in some regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America.In the U.S., affected states include Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, southwestern Utah, and south-central Washington. Most of the 10,000 annual cases are diagnosed in Arizona and California.

, You contract Valley Fever by inhaling microscopic fungal spores that are released into the air when soil is disturbed. If you are in an endemic area and have been exposed to dusty conditions caused by heat mixed with wind and/or manmade disturbances to the soil, you are at a greater risk of being infected.


Construction work, agricultural labor, military field training, and archaeological exploration are examples of activities that can put you at risk of contracting Valley Fever., Not everyone who is exposed to the Coccidioides fungus will contract Valley Fever. The fungal spores can cause infections in people of any age or race, but there are certain groups of people who are more prone to infections.Most cases of Valley Fever occur in adults who are over 60. So, elderly people are at greater risk of infection.
Anyone who has a weakened immune system is at greater risk of contracting the disease and developing more severe forms of it. These people include those who have HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses; expectant mothers, especially in their third trimester; and people who have had an organ transplant.
People of African and/or Filipino descent are more susceptible to Valley Fever.

, The symptoms are often subtle or flu-like, which means that many people never even realize they’ve had it. However, if you have already had it, you will be immune to the disease for life.If you have been tested for Valley Fever previously, it will show up on your medical record. If you have not been tested, you can ask your doctor for a skin test to see if you test positive for Coccidioides. If you do but have never had Valley Fever, it is likely that you are immune to it. Keep in mind that 30-60% of people living in affected areas will test positive for Coccidiodes, but only about 40% of the infected population will ever present symptoms., If you are planning to travel, it might be a good idea to check up on the common diseases and outbreaks in the region you are visiting. Visit the CDC’s website to determine if Valley Fever is something to worry about while you are traveling."

Avoid dusty areas in regions where the infection is indigenous.,
Avoid work and work areas where the soil is disturbed.,
Implement an air filtration system.,
Stay inside during storms.,
Use an N95 respirator.,
Clean any injuries thoroughly.",How to Recognize and Prevent Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)3," These include areas in the affected states which receive very little rainfall, particularly Arizona and California.

, Infections occur when people inhale spores that become airborne after disturbing contaminated soil. If you’re in a high-risk area, stay away from work zones that involve construction, excavation, and agriculture.This also includes domestic labor. If you’re living in an endemic region, you should consult a doctor before doing significant yardwork, gardening, construction projects, or other sorts of digging in your yard or on your property.
If you cannot avoid working in contaminated soil, go to the doctor immediately to get their prevention recommendations. It’s likely that they’ll encourage you to wear a special mask and/or take a preventative antifungal medication to reduce your risk of infection.

, If you live in an affected area, consider keeping your windows closed and using an air filter to ensure that the dust and dirt outside your door doesn’t invade your living space., Winds will kick up dust that contains the pesky fungal spores, so be sure that you find shelter that has closed windows.

, Wear this or a miner’s mask in areas that have recently suffered a natural disaster. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and dust storms, can also disturb contaminated soil. This can cause the spores to become airborne. Use a respirator to avoid breathing in these spores.Normal paper masks or bandanas will not offer protection against Coccidioides since the spores are microscopic. In order to be effective, you need a respirator that will completely seal around your face and prevent particles 2-4 micrometers in size from passing through., Use soap and water to clean any wounds that may have been exposed to dirt or dust. This can help stop an infection from developing."
"
Take a sick day.,
Go to the doctor.,
Get a prescription for antifungal medication.",How to Recognize and Prevent Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)4," For most Valley Fever infections, getting plenty of rest and drinking plenty of fluids will restore you to health. If you only have mild flu-like symptoms, a simple, at-home cure will usually suffice., If you’re worried that you may have Valley Fever, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a medical professional. They will be able to monitor the disease and ensure that your case doesn’t worsen or advance into a disseminated form. Make sure to provide a thorough history of your travels and activities so your doctor can include a comprehensive list of possible infections and appropriate treatment/monitoring.


Seeing the doctor will be beneficial to public health, helping researchers to track the scope and severity of the disease. It will also inform you as to whether or not you have Valley Fever and can expect to be immune to it in the future.

, If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve upon a few day’s bed rest, go to the doctor immediately. They can help address the infection by giving you a prescription for antifungal drugs that can attack the root of the disease.Because these drugs have unpleasant side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, doctors will only generally prescribe them for serious or chronic cases.

Reduce fat consumption.,
Consume less sugar.,
Reduce sodium intake.,
Increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables.,
Include more whole grains.",How to Lose Weight With the DASH Diet2," The DASH diet involves reducing the consumption of saturated and trans fats. These are types of fats which raise the level of cholesterol in your blood, which is dangerous in itself, as high levels of LDL cholesterol increase your risk of stroke and heart disease, and can also lead to weight gain.Foods encouraged by the diet are low-fat dairy products, fat-free products, fish, beans, nuts, fresh poultry, and vegetable oils.
Foods you should avoid while on the DASH diet include full-fat dairy products, fatty meats, and tropical oils, including coconut oil.

, The DASH diet suggests reducing the consumption of sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages like soda. Simple replacements, like opting for water instead of juice or reaching for an apple when you would have otherwise eaten a donut, are good ways to get less sugar in your system.


You don’t need to deprive yourself of sweets entirely. Just limit consumption to five or fewer servings per week.However, this does not mean you can eat five pieces of cake per week. Make sure to count things like the sugar you add to your coffee, jam you put on your toast, and anything else that contains sugar.

, The main way to do this is to opt for lean meats, fresh poultry, and fish instead of high-sodium foods like ham or bacon. As a whole, the DASH diet involves limiting daily sodium levels to 2,300 mg. You can also drop sodium intake to 1,500 mg if recommended by your doctor.Another way to reduce sodium intake is to avoid adding salt when cooking pasta or rice or when flavoring food.
Read food labels when shopping and opt for foods that are low in sodium.

, Aim to eat 4-5 servings of vegetables as well as 4-5 servings of fruit per day.Vegetables you could add to your diet include tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes. These don’t have to be side dishes - they can be thrown into recipes like stir-fries or served over dishes like brown rice.
There is a wide array of fruit that you could add to your diet, from apples to pears to kiwis or oranges. Bananas are also great choices, as they are high in potassium. Many fruits are high in fiber and low in fat, so it’s wise to eat a piece of fruit with every meal plus another fruit daily as a snack.

Keep in mind that foods that are high in fiber can cause temporary bloating and diarrhea. To prevent this, transition to the DASH diet gradually and increase intake of water as you add more fruits and vegetables.



, Eating whole grains that are high in fiber is an important part of the DASH diet. Aim for six to eight servings of whole grains every day.For example, you can start your day with oatmeal, use whole grain bread to make a sandwich at lunch, and have some brown rice as a side dish with dinner.

Substitute unhealthy snacks with fruit.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Go for low-fat options.,
Distribute your caloric intake.",How to Lose Weight With the DASH Diet3," Studies have shown that keeping unhealthy snacks out of reach and healthy snacks, like fruit, nearby leads to healthier eating habits. So when you are craving cookies, eat a medium apple instead. You’ll satiate your hunger in a healthy way that is conducive to weight loss., Studies have shown that eating smaller portions throughout the day leads to weight loss. So, if you are craving a hamburger, by all means eat it - depriving yourself will only lead to unhappiness. However, do make it a 3 ounce burger rather than a 6 ounce one. , Opt for fat-free dressings or condiments, which will reduce your waist size in the long run.Low-fat options don’t always mean fewer calories. Check the food label to compare caloric values of different items.

, If you notice that you tend to overeat during certain meals, cut back on the amount of food you consume during said meal or redistribute the calories throughout the day.


For example, if you eat a light lunch and a heavy dinner, consider eating a heavier lunch and a lighter dinner. This will give your body a chance to process the calories throughout the afternoon rather than at night, so you’ll burn off those calories more easily."
"
Control portion size.,
Exercise frequently.,
Limit alcohol intake.,
Get enough sleep.,
Speak with your doctor.",How to Lose Weight With the DASH Diet4," Ideas for how to do this include downsizing your dishes, eating without watching TV or being otherwise distracted, and keeping unhealthy food out of sight. An important component of the DASH diet is also to eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. This is a way to reduce the risk of overeating and to distribute your energy evenly during the day.


The DASH diet is not for everyone. However, even if you do not subscribe to the entire DASH diet, you can still use portion control as a weight-loss mechanism.

, Regular exercise reduces your risk for a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, and is a great way to keep your weight down., Alcohol is high in calories, with some mixed drinks containing as many calories as a meal, and can contribute to weight gain., Keeping to a regular sleep schedule and sleeping about 8 hours a day has been proven to help maintain a lower percentage of body fat and promotes overall good health., If you notice that you are unable to lose weight, consult with your doctor and ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian. This may be due to a health condition such as hypothyroidism or Cushing’s syndrome."

Ask your doctor about antifungal medication.",How to Recognize Aspergillosis Symptoms," Aspergillosis starts in the lungs and the tubes (bronchi) that attach to the lungs. The aspergillusspores basically ""hatch"" there and grow quickly, forming lots of tangled fungus fibers (called fungus balls) within the air spaces.The fungus penetrates the mucus membranes of the lungs and triggers chronic hemoptysis — coughing that brings up blood, sometimes lots of it.


In addition to blood, the coughing frequently brings up thick lumps of mucus.
Despite the coughing and the spores being able to survive in saliva, aspergillosis is not contagious from person to person.
Pulmonary aspergillosis is most likely to develop in people with chronic lung disorders, such as tuberculosis, emphysema, sarcoidosis or even asthma.;
, Along with near constant productive coughing (mucus and blood), the aspergillus fungal infection of the lungs and airways also cause breathing difficulties, such as wheezing and shortness of breath.The breathing is often labored and sounds like a reoccurring mild asthma attack. Without being able to bring in much oxygen with each breath, sufferers constantly appear winded.


Cardiovascular exercise is very difficult with pulmonary aspergillosis, so it's best to rest until you get rid of the lung infection.
Asthma and aspergillosis often co-exist at the same time. The fungal infection makes the asthma much more difficult to manage with medication.The chronic coughing and shortness of breath can sometimes cause significant chest pain, similar to severe bronchitis or bacterial pneumonia.

, Another symptom associated with the early stages of aspergillosis is moderate-to-severe fatigue — feeling very tired and run down regardless of the amount of sleep you get.Fatigue is common with most infections, but more so with lung infections because tissues tend to get less oxygen.


Due to the chronic coughing, breathing difficulty and potential chest pain, many sufferers of aspergillosis have difficulty sleeping at night and become sleep deprived — which also contributes to the fatigue.
In addition to people with chronic lung diseases, chemotherapy patients, organ transplant recipients, people with a very low white blood cell count, people taking high doses of glucocorticoids, and AIDS patients are also more susceptible to aspergillosis.

, Despite not being able to exercise, pulmonary aspergillosis (like most serious infections) typically triggers unintended weight loss.Your immune system burns lots of calories trying to fight the fungal infection, plus your appetite is usually reduced, so weight loss becomes noticeable after a few weeks. Losing more than 5 pounds a week is cause for concern.


The coughing up of blood, fatigue and wasting away associated with pulmonary aspergillosis really mimics lung cancer, although survival rates are much better with the fungal infection.
Most people lose weight in the face and neck area initially, then the waist, buttocks and thighs. Keep a close eye on your scales if you develop a cough that won't go away.

, Some people with severe asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to the aspergillus mold spores once they breath them in, which is called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or ABPA.Symptoms are similar to asthma (wheezing and shortness of breath), but can also include stuffiness, a runny nose, temporary loss of smell and headache if the sinuses are involved.An allergic reaction triggers the release of histamine, which quickly causes localized inflammation and congestion.
People with cystic fibrosis and asthma tend to have more mucus in their airways, which seems to provide a good environment for the mold to grow in and trigger an allergic reaction.Aspergillosis may also lead to a sinus infection, especially in those with abnormally low levels of white blood cells and those with diabetes mellitus.

, As the pulmonary aspergillosis becomes invasive (infects the blood), other more diverse symptoms start to develop, including a fever and chills.A moderate fever with sporadic chills is common for any infection that spreads to the blood, not specific for aspergillosis.


Invasive aspergillosis usually develops in people who are already sick from other chronic diseases, so it's difficult to know which symptoms are caused by which condition.A severe fever (greater than 103ºF or 39.4°C) is very rare with aspergillosis — between 99ºF (37.2°C) and 101ºF (38.3°C) is more common.

, Once aspergillosis infects the blood, it spreads rapidly around the body, including the brain, heart, kidneys and skin.Telltale signs that aspergillus fungus has infected the brain include headaches and behavioral changes. A person may become quick to anger, get confused easily, seem distracted or appear more obsessive / compulsive.


Headaches are caused by mild swelling from the fungal growth. The brain is very sensitive to changes in pressure.
Behavioral and mood changes can be triggered by brain swelling, neuron damage/death, reduced neurotransmitter (hormone) production and from any toxins released by the fungi.
Symptoms relating to the central nervous symptom are serious and should be addressed by a doctor as soon as possible.

, Other symptoms that invasive aspergillosis has spread to the brain include eye symptoms (partial or intermittent blindness) and facial swelling, typically only on one side of the face at a time.The fungus can invade the eyeball, but it usually just affects the optic nerve and/or the optical center of the brain.


Facial swelling and potential paralysis from aspergillosis can mimic a stroke because it usually just affects one side of the face.
Similar to a stroke, fungal damage to one side of the brain affects the opposite side of the face and body.
Invasive aspergillosis spreads rapidly and is often fatal, particularly if it gets to the brain or heart, in spite of early treatment., Although relatively uncommon, aspergillosis can also spread to the skin and cause fungal infections there, particularly in people with very weak immune systems.The lesions or rash appear inflamed and reddish, with a center that's often dark colored (dark blue or black). The fungus can burrow into skin and cause inflammation and itchiness.


Skin lesions of some sort occur in about 5-10% of patients with invasive aspergillosis.
A skin biopsy (tissue sample) is taken from the lesion before a diagnosis of aspergillosis is made, although many of the above-mentioned symptoms usually occur it spreads to the skin.

, In most cases of simple isolated pulmonary aspergillosis, treatment isn't needed as the lung infection doesn't create intolerable symptoms and most medications aren't usually effective against fungus anyways.If the symptoms are only mild or non-existent, aspergillomas is usually closely monitored by chest x-rays every six to 12 months.


If your immune system gets stronger, that's usually enough to successfully combat aspergillosis if it hasn't spread into the bloodstream and become systemic and invasive.
If the condition progresses, particularly if breathing becomes difficult and significant amounts of blood are coughed up, then corticosteroid and anti-fungal drugs are usually recommended.

, Oral corticosteroids (by mouth) are strong anti-inflammatory medications typically recommended for people with aspergillosis who also suffer from pre-existing asthma or cystic fibrosis.Corticosteroids such as prednisone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone are effective for combating allergic reactions and asthma symptoms in the short-term, but aren't used for much more than a few months.


Although corticosteroids help prevent allergic reactions and reduce inflammation within the respiratory system, they also suppress the immune system even further, which increases the risk of invasive or system aspergillosis.
Other side effects from taking steroids for too long include weight gain, high blood pressure (hypertension) and weakened bones (osteoporosis).

, Antifungal drugs are the standard treatment for invasive / systemic aspergillosis, as well as severely symptomatic pulmonary aspergillosis.Your doctor will likely prescribe voriconazole (Vfend), which is preferred because it seems more effective with fewer side effects, or echinocandin. Ask your doctor if antifungals are appropriate for your situation.


Antifungal drugs aren't helpful for treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but they can be combined with corticosteroids to improve lung function.
If voriconazole isn't effective or well tolerated, other drugs can be tried, such as itraconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, caspofungin, micafungin or posaconazole.All anti-fungal drugs can lead to serious side effects, including kidney and liver damage, so ask your doctor about the pros and cons of such medications.
Antifungal medications are continued until signs and symptoms of the infection are resolved, and may be continued for longer in patients with apparent immune problems.

Wear loose fitting clothes made from a breathable fabric.,
Change out of wet or sweaty clothing right away.,
Shower instead of taking baths.,
Choose unscented tampons and hygiene products.,
Wipe from front to back when you use the bathroom.",How to Prevent Yeast Infections1," Avoid wearing tight pants made from synthetic materials, such as spandex. Instead, choose clothing that is loose fitting and made from a breathable natural material, such as cotton. Tight fitting clothing is more likely to create a moist environment in the vaginal area and synthetic materials do not breathe as well as natural ones. Both of these factors make it more likely for a yeast infection to develop.If you must wear pantyhose or spandex leggings, choose ones that have a cotton panel in the crotch. This cotton panel will help to pull moisture away from the vaginal area.
If you are especially prone to yeast infections, then you may want to skip pantyhose and leggings altogether. Opt for loose fitting pants and skirts to keep the vaginal area dry.;
, Avoid wearing moist clothing for too long. If your clothing and or undergarments are wet from going swimming or going to the gym, change into clean dry clothes as soon as possible. Keeping the vaginal area dry will help to prevent yeast infections., Hot baths may increase your chances of developing a yeast infection, so it is best to take showers if you are prone to yeast infections.Use a gentle soap or body wash to clean the outside of your vagina.


Do not clean the inside of your vagina because doing so may throw off your vaginal pH.
Avoid hot baths and hot tubs as well.

, The perfumes in scented tampons can throw off the balance of bacteria in your vagina, which may cause a yeast infection. Other scented products may also cause such an imbalance, so avoid products that are scented or that have lots of chemicals.Avoid douches, feminine deodorant sprays, and vaginal cleansers.
Avoid using talcum powder or baby powder in the genital region. Talcum powder usage has been linked with ovarian cancer and some studies estimate a 30-60% increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who use talcum powder in the vaginal area., Women are often taught to wipe from front to back because of the proximity of the anus to the vagina. Bad bacteria from the anus may cause a yeast infection if it gets into the vagina. In order to reduce the chances of getting bad bacteria in the vagina, it is important to wipe from front to back when you use the bathroom."

Stop obsessing over weight.,
Develop a healthy attitude toward food.,
Find real cures for sadness.,
Accept your life as it is.,
Eat when you're actually hungry.,
Remember that hunger comes and goes.,
Eat mindfully.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Live Like a Natural Thin Person," If you're trying to lose weight, it may seem impossible to pull yourself away from the scale or stop checking if your ""goal"" clothing fits. But one of the biggest lifestyle and mindset tips to take away from naturally thin people is that obsessing over your weight is unhealthy. People who are naturally thin do not conflate body size or weight with happiness, and neither should you.Avoid judging your body as having to be either all bad or all good. You can feel confident about yourself at your current weight, and if you want to lose some weight simply remind yourself that you're still a beautiful or handsome individual, even as you work to lose that weight.;
, Many people, especially those who diet and/or exercise compulsively, feel guilty when it comes to food. For some, that guilt leads to a lower self image and may result in more compulsive dieting and/or exercising. It's important to be mindful of the dietary choices you make, but remember that naturally thin people don't fixate or obsess over their dietary choices, and neither should you.Not obsessing over dietary choices doesn't mean eating anything you want all the time. Rather, it means acknowledging that everyone slips up sometimes. That doesn't mean you should give up on eating healthy for the rest of the day, nor does it mean working out for three hours afterwards. Simply accept a slip up for what it is and move on., Eating when you feel sad or lonely may be a soothing distraction, but ultimately that's all it does: distract you from your real problems. Those problems will still be there tomorrow and the next day, and no amount of comfort eating will ever truly fix those issues. Naturally thin people don't equate food with happiness, so when they're feeling sad or lonely they're more likely to seek out real, lasting solutions to those problems.If you're feeling lonely, get out and socialize. Get together with friends for coffee or a walk in the park, or go out and make new friends. Social activity is the only thing that will ultimately cure your loneliness, so avoid seeking comfort in food altogether.If you have deeper issues like depression, talk to your doctor or a therapist. Therapy, medication, or a combination of the two are far more likely to make you feel better than the empty calories of comfort food.

, Some people feel that if they could only lose a little more weight, all of their other problems in life would disappear. The reality, of course, is that this simply isn't true. This ""scapegoat"" effect is highly problematic, and may lead to unrealistic expectations of weight loss and lifestyle. Having a few extra pounds is not causing you to have problems at work or in dating — so work on changing those aspects of your life, or learn to accept your life and feel happy with the person you are., Snacking compulsively or to satisfy feelings of sadness is a common problem that can easily lead to unmanageable weight gain. One of the best dietary choices of naturally thin people worth emulating is to only eat when you're actually hungry.If you feel compelled to snack between meals, try waiting 15 to 20 minutes and drink a glass of water. If you still feel hungry after that, you may need to eat. If not, it was probably just a passing craving or a desire to snack compulsively.

, Hunger is not an absolute. Most people feel sudden bursts of hunger that end up dissipating fairly quickly without food. Try to go several hours without snacking or eating, and keep track of how uncomfortable you actually are. Many people find that if they hold off until the next meal, they don't actually suffer and they feel better for having waited., If you're actually hungry and you're craving your favorite guilty pleasure, there's really no harm in indulging a little. But the key takeaway there is ""a little."" You don't need to eat a whole carton of ice cream — you can nibble on a reasonably-sized scoop to satisfy your craving without any guilt.Practice self-control.Being able to still eat your favorite foods may reduce the likelihood of binge eating.People who are naturally thin and people who work hard to be fit equally enjoy indulgences from time to time. The key is to avoid over-indulging. Limit how much you eat when it comes to snacks and sweets and you'll feel satisfied and maintain confidence., Thin people exercise, and not just for weight loss reasons. Exercise can help manage pain and stress while also reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety — all problems that lead many people to compulsively eat. Instead of reaching for a greasy or sweet snack when you're feeling anxious or upset, try going for a bike ride or a long walk to clear your head.Rather than focusing on being thin or skinny, focus on living a healthy lifestyle.Experts recommend getting at least 150 minutes each week of moderate aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes each week of high-intensity aerobic exercise."

These probiotics species are considered a natural part of vaginal flora and they help keep the vagina in balance.Try eating a cup of yogurt daily.
Consider taking a daily probiotic supplement.

, Antibiotic use has been linked with yeast infections, so do not use antibiotics unless it is absolutely necessary. It is especially important to avoid broad spectrum antibiotics, since they may kill off good bacteria along with the bad., Women with diabetes are more prone to yeast infections, so it is important to take extra precautions if you are diabetic. Keep your blood glucose levels under control to help reduce your risk of developing a yeast infection along with other complications., Stress has also been linked with yeast infections, so it is important to manage stress if you are prone to yeast infections.

It is possible to get recurring yeast infections. Some women may get four or more yeast infections per year.Tell your doctor if you get frequent yeast infections. Your doctor may be able to determine an underlying cause and help you take appropriate preventative measures.

, Your doctor can diagnose your yeast infection to be sure that that is what you are dealing with. Your doctor may be able to tell that you have a yeast infection just by doing a vaginal examination, but if the cause of your condition is unclear, your doctor can examine a swab of your discharge under a microscope.

, A yeast infection is usually treated with an antifungal agent. Your doctor may either recommend that you take a single oral dose of Diflucan 2 gm orally, or nighty Diflucan or clotrimazole, which is available over the counter in most drugstores. All “azole” medications have similar safety and efficacy.Follow the package and/or your doctor’s instructions for use.
There are several types of over-the-counter yeast infection treatments available in one day, three day, or five day regimens, and they have all been shown to be safe and effective by the FDA.
Some options will require a prescription. For example, a single dose of Diflucan, requires a healthcare provider visit and a prescription."

",How to Live a Healthy Lifestyle," Unhealthy fats include both trans fats and saturated fats. These fats will raise your LDL cholesterol, and elevated LDL cholesterol often correlates with an increased risk for heart disease.Foods that are high in trans fats include foods made with ""partially hydrogenated oils,"" such as shortening or margarine. Baked goods, fried foods, frozen pizza, and other highly processed foods often contain trans fats.Foods that are high in saturated fats include pizza, cheese, red meat, and full-fat dairy products.Coconut oil is also high in saturated fat, but may also increase good cholesterol, so it's okay to use in moderation.;
, Poly-unsaturated, mono-unsaturated and omega-3 fats are all good lifestyle choices.These good fats lower your LDL cholesterol and raise your HDL cholesterol, which correlates with decreased risk for heart disease.Choose oils such as olive, canola, soy, peanut, sunflower, and corn oil.Fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Choose fish including salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines, and herring. You can also get omega-3s from plant sources, like flaxseed, plant oils, and nuts and seeds, although your body doesn't process the fats from these as effectively., Minimize your consumption of sweets, soft drinks, sugary fruit juices, and white bread. Choose whole fruits, freshly-squeezed juices, and whole grain bread instead.,


Eat fruits and vegetables for their high vitamin and mineral content. Try to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, rather than canned ones that often contain added sugar or salt.
Choose lean meat, beans and tofu for their protein content.
Enjoy whole grains such as whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, brown rice and quinoa.
Eat low-fat dairy products. Skim milk and reduced fat cheeses will reduce your fat intake while ensuring that you receive enough calcium.

, Shop at a natural food store or buy food from your local farmer's market. Organic foods are not more nutritious for you, but they don't contain as much pesticide residue or food additives. They are generally more eco-friendly, too.If price is a factor for you, consider buying only certain foods organic, such as apples, berries, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, etc.), grapes, celery, bell peppers, greens, potatoes, and lettuce.These foods often have much higher pesticide use than other produce when grown conventionally.

, Gentle stretching will warm up your muscles before you work out and will relax your muscles after you work out.Try a calf stretch. Stand at arm's length away from a wall and put your right foot behind your left foot. Bend your left leg forward, but keep your right leg straight and grounded on the floor. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds, then switch to the other leg.
Stretch out your hamstrings. Lie on the floor near a wall or door frame. Raise your left leg and place your heel against the wall. Straighten your leg until you feel a stretch at the back of your thigh. Hold this for about 30 seconds, then stretch the other leg.
Do a hip flexor stretch. Kneel on your right knee and put your left foot in front of you. Shift your body weight as you lean forward onto your left leg. You should feel a stretch in your right thigh. Hold this for about 30 seconds, then stretch the other side.
Stretch your shoulders. Bring your left arm across your chest and hold it with your right arm. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.

, Work out for half an hour to an hour, combining both cardio and strength training programs. Experts recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every week.Aim to do strength training at least twice a week.

, Go for a jog or take your dog for a walk. Make sure that you move at a moderate pace for at least 30 minutes.

, Both high-intensity gardening and housekeeping can exercise your body.You can also incorporate more activity into your daily routine by taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away from shops, and taking a quick walk on your lunch break.

, Walk or bike to your destination instead. If you use public transportation, try getting off a few stops early and walking the rest of the way., Once you've lost weight thanks to your improved lifestyle, then work hard to maintain your weight instead of cycling up and down the scale., Avoid liquid diets, diet pills and other diet supplements unless you are under the supervision of a physician. In general, if a diet plan or product does any of the following, it's probably a fad:Promises extremely quick weight loss (more than 1-2 pounds per week)
Promises to help you lose weight without changing your habits
Requires you to spend a lot of money
Restricts your food choices and doesn't encourage balanced nutrition

, Working out too long, too often or with too much intensity can increase your risk for injury. Make sure to build in some rest periods between your workouts.

, Being overweight and being underweight are not healthy states of being. Consult your doctor or a reputable weight chart that shows ideal weights for your age and body type.

, Smoking is associated with a variety of health risks, including heart or liver disease and many cancers. Alcohol is also associated with health risks, including liver disease, cancer, heart disease, alcohol poisoning, and depression., Studies have shown that those who sleep less tend to weigh more. Adults should aim for between 7-9 hours of sleep per night.Children and teens need even more sleep. Young children may need between 10-14 hours of sleep, school-age children between 9-11, and teenagers between 8-10., Sun exposure creates many health risks, including cancer. Whenever you're outdoors, wear protective clothing and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Wear sunscreen even on cloudy days., Shower again if you have performed an activity that has made you sweat.This will cut down on body odor, body acne, and hygiene-related diseases such as scabies.

Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Your feet should be facing forward, rather than turned out to the side. Tighten your stomach muscles for stability.
Place your hands in a prayer position, with the palms touching. They should be parallel to your chest, but not touching.
Bend your knees and squat down as if you were going to sit on a chair. Stop when your thighs are parallel to the ground.
Be careful that you squat downward, rather than forward. Perform your first squats sideways in front of a mirror, so that you can check your knees and the curvature of your back.
Pause at the bottom. Then, rise again squeezing your buttocks as you stand. You should feel your gluteal muscles and upper thighs working to lift you to a standing position.
Repeat this exercise in reps of 10-20. Keep in mind that squats are a strength training and cardio exercise so they should be difficult. Reduce the repetitions to 10 if you cannot keep the proper form throughout the exercise.
Increase the intensity of this butt-lifting exercise by adding hand weights. Use 2 to 5 lb hand weights and hold them down at your sides as you squat down.;
, The plie is actually an exercise that got it's start in ballet studios. A common exercise for dancers, doing plies is another great exercise to lift your butt.Move your feet out so that they are slightly wider than hip width apart. Your toes should be turned outwards away from your body at about a 45 degree angle.
Check whether you are in proper position by ensuring your knees line up with your second toes. If they do not, turn out your feet less. Your knees must track over the second toe to keep the pressure from falling into the knee joint.
Raise your arms out to the sides so they are parallel to the floor, like a ballet dancer, as you squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor. If you cannot plie to a parallel position, do a smaller move and work toward the full squat.
Pause at the bottom. Then, slowly lift yourself back up to a straight position squeezing your glutes as you come back up to the starting position.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times. You can increase the intensity by holding a kettle bell with both hands. The process of turning out the legs will concentrate the effort in a different part of the glutes.

, A common exercise to strength and tone your lower body, the lunge is one of the best moves to tone your butt.Stand with feet at hip width again. Make sure you have plenty of space to the front and back of you for this particular exercise.
Reach one leg back several feet. Bend the knee of your back leg until it almost touches the ground. Your front knee should be in a straight line with your front foot.
Pause at the bottom of the lunge, and then return to the original position by pushing with your front leg back to a standing position.
Repeat 10 times switching between each leg.
You may want to consider holding light dumbbells in each hand to increase the intensity of this exercise.

, This is an easy move that you can do anywhere and requires no weights. It's great to help isolate your butt muscles.Stand with feet hip width apart holding gently onto the back of a chair. Lift your right leg straight back with your foot flexed. Lift until your leg is almost at hip height.
Bend your left knee slightly so that it can stabilize you.
Lower your right leg down until your toes almost touch the ground and then repeat the exercise.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times on your right leg. Then, switch to your left leg.

, This is a unique exercise that isolates the outside muscles of your buttocks.


Lay down on an exercise mat. Lay on your left side first, with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle and slightly in front of you.
Rest your head on your left arm. Focus on flexing your stomach in and keeping your hips and back in the same position during this entire exercise.
While keeping your feet together, lift your right knee up and back towards your hips as far as you can while keeping your hips stacked. You should feel this in the side of your butt.
Pause at the top and slowly lower. The movement should look like the closing and opening of a clam shell. Repeat 10 to 20 times on each side.

, This particular exercise works not only your butt muscles, but also the back of your legs and lower back.To start, lay down on your back on an exercise mat. Bend your knees at a 90 degree angel in front of you with your feet flat on the ground.
Lay your arms in a relaxed position by the side of your body. Tighten your core muscles throughout the exercise.
Lift your butt up towards the ceiling, pressing through your pelvis. Lift until your body is in a straight line.
Squeeze your buttocks as you pause for a second as you hold the bridge position, then lower back down to the floor. Do this exercise about 10-20 times.

, Studies have showed that some cardio exercises work your gluteal muscles more than others.The treadmill or jogging was ranked as number 1.


Jogging is a great cardio exercise that not only lifts your butt muscles, but can help you burn fat to help you look more toned overall.
When you're jogging, make sure you focus on running heel to toe. This is the appropriate form for running.
To take jogging to the next level, increase the incline on the treadmill or find a hilly route to run., Another butt kicking and toning cardio activity is spinning or using a stationary bike. This high intensity exercise will be an excellent aerobic exercise but also helps tone your butt and legs.Use a stationary bike (not a recumbent) at your local gym. Take it slow if you're a beginner.
To help really work your butt, push down forcefully on the pedals as you bike.It's actually a myth that spinning makes your legs bigger or thicker. Overall, it generally helps slim down your legs., Another cardio machine that was ranked as activating your butt muscles was the elliptical.Although not as good as jogging, the elliptical is a low-impact machine that can tone your butt.


When you're using the elliptical, help isolate your butt muscles by sticking your butt out slightly and pushing down hard with the heels of your feet.You can increase the resistance of the elliptical to make it more difficult.

, Yoga and pilates are strengthening classes that use your own body weight to help you strengthen, tone and elongate your muscles.There are a variety of poses in both pilates and yoga that specifically target your buttocks and lower body.
Classes range from 45-60 minutes in general. Take a beginners or introductory course if you haven't tried it before.

, Barre classes are fairly new to the gym class scene. It is based on ballet dance moves and also incorporates some yoga, pilates and light hand weights.As with yoga and pilates, barre class will focus on a variety of exercises. Some focus exclusively on targeting the buttocks. For example, the plie exercise is done frequently at barre classes.
Barre classes are a great class for both beginners and advanced fitness-goers as the poses are easily adaptable to any skill level.

, Many gyms and fitness centers also offer kickboxing classes. These are high intensity cardio classes whose moves are great for toning your thighs and butt.Kickboxing involves a variety of moves based on martial arts. Many of the kicks require strength from your glutes, quadriceps and hamstrings.
In addition to toning your butt, kickboxing may burn up to 350 calories an hour."

Drink adequate fluids.",How to Lose 5 Pounds," Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) reflects the amount of calories your body burns doing daily, vital functions like breathing and circulating blood. This number will help you know how many calories your body needs at an absolute minimum to function.


Women should use the following formula:655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years)
Men should use the following formula:66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)
It's not recommended to cut calories below your body's BMR. This is considered unsafe and unhealthy.;
, Including your general activity level into your calorie range is helpful. You burn calories throughout the day in addition to your BMR. Walking around, standing up, sitting down, lifting items all burn calories.These types of minor lifestyle activities should be included into your daily total.


If you are sedentary, multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are moderately active, multiply your BMR by 1.3–1.4. If you are very active multiply your BMR by 1.4–1.5. This resulting number is an estimate of the number of calories you burn per day.
Example: If you were a man with a BMR of 1,924.8 and lived an active lifestyle then you would need to multiply your BMR by 1.4. If you did this, you would find that you burn approximately 2,695 calories per day.
This calculation can also show you how many calories you currently burn at your activity level and how many you could burn if you were more active throughout the day.
You can also use a variety of online calculators or charts instead of doing the math yourself, such as this one. This might be easier for some.

, A reasonable calorie goal would be to consume about 500 calories less than you currently burn per day.Cutting out about 500 calories daily will result in about a 1–2 pound weight loss per week. This slower, more steady weight loss is considered safer, healthier and more sustainable by health professionalsCutting out more calories may result in additional weight loss; however, it's not recommended to consume fewer than 1,200 calories daily for adults. It's difficult to consume adequate nutrients and calories to sustain a healthy functioning body.When you've only got another 5 pounds to lose, those last few pounds can be stubborn.; however, it's important to be patient and follow safe and healthy dieting practices. Those pesky last pounds will come off.

, Once you've figured out how many calories you should be eating and how many you're going to be cutting out for your diet, it's time to set your weight loss timeline.


Since it's not considered safe to lose more than 1–2 pounds per week, a 5 pound weight loss should take anywhere from three to five weeks.
Plan your calendar and timeline to incorporate enough time for a 5 pound weight loss. You may need to start dieting and exercising about one month prior to your event or goal date.
You may lose weight a little faster or slower. Everyone will have a different weight loss speed due to their age, gender, weight, activity level and diet.

, Cardiovascular exercise is good for overall health and weight loss.Adding in regular aerobic exercise can help support your weight loss by burning more calories each day.


Some cardiovascular exercise you might consider including are: A light two mile jog before breakfast a few days a week, 20 minutes on the stair master or 20 minutes of high intensity interval training a few days a week.
You can also try aerobic classes, dancing, rowing, swimming, biking or using the elliptical.
Aim for about 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. In addition to supporting your weight loss, this amount of physical activity can help improve your mood, energy level and decrease your risk for heart disease.If you seem to be struggling with those last 5 pounds, try increasing the frequency, intensity or duration of your cardio exercise. This can help boost your metabolism to get your body to drop that last bit of weight.

, With any weight loss diet, it's normal to lose a little lean muscle mass along with fat mass. However, you want to minimize how much muscle you lose. To help maintain your muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, consider taking up weight training two times a week.


To maximize your benefits from strength training, plan to do 20 minutes of strength training about two to three times a week.Strength training can include: weight training classes, yoga or pilates, using free weights or machines, or doing body weight exercises like push-ups or sit-ups.
If you have not weight trained before, you may feel sore the first week. Like all new exercise, introduce it slowly to let your body adapt and avoid injury.

, When you're trying to lose weight, there's a fine balance between cutting out calories and burning them with exercise.


Remember, it's not considered safe to eat fewer calories than your BMR each day. It's also not considered safe to burn so many calories working out, that your net calorie intake is less than your BMR.For example, if you only ate 1,200 calories in one day and the burned 300 calories with exercise, your total net calorie intake is 900. This is too low.
You may need to adjust your calorie intake with foods to ensure you're eating a net of at least 1,200 calories daily.

, A food journal is essential when you're trying to lose weight. You can keep track of how many calories you're supposed to be eating and how much you eat throughout the day.When you're tracking your food each day, make sure to include all foods you eat — even a taste or two while you're cooking. The more accurate you are, the more likely you are to be successful.A food journal is also a great tool to use if you're not losing weight or hit a stall. You can refer to your notes to see how well you were following your diet or staying within your predetermined calorie limits.

, Eating a well-balanced diet means you're consuming a wide variety of foods from every food group. This type of eating will help ensure that you're getting enough of every recommended nutrient your body needs.A well-balanced diet is also important for weight loss. Missing nutrients from an overly restrictive diet can slow your weight loss or make you feel fatigued and tired.When you're planning out your day, make sure that you're eating a food from each food group. In addition, choose a variety of foods from within each food group.

, If you're planning on cutting out 500 calories from your diet each day, you're going to have to cut back on different food groups. Cutting out more calories from the grain food group can help you lose more weight without risking any nutrient deficiencies.


Lean protein helps your body function and run all essential processes. It's not wise to restrict calories from this group.
Fruits and vegetables are also not food groups that you should necessarily limit. They contain fiber, vitamins and minerals that many other foods do not.
Grains do contain fiber and some minerals, but the majority of the nutrients found in grains can also be found in other food groups. That is why it's safe to cut calories from this particular group of foods.

, Processed foods are usually high in calories and low in nutrients.In addition, highly processed food usually does not contain much fiber, which can leave you feeling hungrier throughout the day.
Avoid foods like: pastries, cakes or cookies, frozen dinners or desserts, breakfast meat, deli meat and foods made with processed white flour (like bread or pasta).
Throw out junk foods and processed foods. Get rid of tempting treats and processed foods. When there are fewer tempting foods in your house, you may be less likely to choose those options.

, It's important to try to stay hydrated each day. This will help your body function normally and help support your weight loss.


When you're thirsty, your body sends a signal to your brain that feels very similar to hunger. Many times people end up eating, when they really just needed more hydrating fluids.Everyone needs varying amounts of fluids each day. The goal is to not feel thirsty and to have your urine a very pale yellow color by the end of the day.Stick to sugar-free, decaffeinated beverages like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea.
Ditch sweetened beverages like sodas, sweet teas, sports drinks or juices. These contain extra sugar and calories which can really sabotage your weight loss efforts.

Find the root of the problem.",How to Let Go of Unhealthy Foods," When you eat sugar, salt and other strong flavors you can train your palate to find food that doesn’t contain these items dull. Part of letting go of unhealthy food is learning to embrace what’s healthy. Find out what’s in season where you live, explore new flavors, and try new recipes. You’ll soon find you actually enjoy eating healthy food.


For example, if you live near the ocean, you probably have delicious fresh seafood available. Enjoy the foods unique to where you live.
Or visit a restaurant with cuisine you don’t normally have. Just try to order fresh food that isn’t fried or buried in rich sauce.;
, You’ll know exactly what you’re putting in your food. Even if you cook something you don’t consider healthy, like fried chicken, if you use fresh raw ingredients it’s still going to end up being better for your body than the fast food version.


If you’re new to cooking, consider taking a class so you can learn more about how to make food that’s healthy and still tastes delicious. It is very important that the food taste good, since if it doesn’t you’ll probably switch back to less healthy options.

, When you nourish your body with healthy fruits and vegetables, you have less room for food that’s less-than-healthy. No matter what else is on the menu, try starting your meals with a helping of either fruit, vegetables or both.


Fresh fruit and vegetables are better than dried or juiced, since they contain fiber and water that fill you up.
Avoid fruit juice, which contains as much sugar as soda.

, When you don’t have enough protein in your diet, you tend to reach for comfort foods that end up spoiling your diet. Make sure every meal contains protein so you stay full and feel energized throughout the day.


Eggs, meat, fish, poultry and dairy products are great sources of animal protein.
If you’re a vegetarian, eat beans, nuts, soy products and other veggie protein sources.

, If you stick to one health-conscious rule, let it be this one. Processed, packaged foods usually contain a lot of extra salt, sugar, trans fats and chemical preservatives to add flavor and help them go months (or years) without spoiling. You end up eating a lot more unhealthy additives than necessary.

, Frying is different from other cooking methods in that it changes the properties of the food, making it less healthy for your body than food that’s broiled, grilled, steamed or sauteed. Whenever you have a choice, choose food that has been cooked using a method other than frying.


If you have a recipe that calls for frying, try oven-”frying” instead. It still results in excellent flavor without deep frying your food in oil.
When you do fry food, use grapeseed oil or coconut oil, which are healthier than vegetable oil and peanut oil.

, Sometimes it seems like the tastiest foods are the ones we must avoid, and sugar is no exception. Eliminating sweets can go a long way toward keeping your body in good health. Try cutting back on the following:


Sugary drinks
Baked goods
Candy
Artificial sweeteners

, In many cases hunger is mistaken for thirst, and those rumblings in your stomach can be sated with water instead of food. Try drinking a tall glass of water with lemon squeezed into it, and you should feel less hungry.


This also works with tea, coffee or soda water. Beverages help you feel full without the extra calories.
However, you should avoid sugar-free or diet sodas, since they have ingredients that may actually increase cravings instead of quelling them.

, When you feel too hungry for a simple glass of water, reach for a handful of almonds or walnuts. You could also slice up an avocado and eat it with a little salt and lemon. These foods contain natural substances that make you feel fuller, longer. They’re extremely nutritious as well.


Though nuts are very good for you, they are calorie-rich. Limit your portions to a handful at a time.
For added variety, try roasting raw nuts with olive oil and a fresh herb like rosemary, or thyme. Or add spicy pepper seasoning for a fiery twist. Snacking on something high in flavor will keep you satisfied longer.

, Coconut oil is extremely satiating, in part because it’s high in calories. However, these are the calories you want, rich with nutrients and fat that will keep you from eating processed foods and help your hair and skin look healthy.


To help it go down easier, have your coconut oil with some fresh berries or other fruit.
Or you could stir it into your coffee for a delicious coconutty treat.

, Mint-flavored gum is best. The minty flavor doesn’t mix well with most foods, so you’ll be less likely to indulge in an unhealthy snack. If you don’t have gum around, just smelling something minty can also do the trick. Brushing your teeth also works!

, Do you eat when you’re bored? Many people do, so keeping busy is one of the best ways to let go of your need to eat unhealthy foods. If you’re active, you won’t have time to worry about whether or not you should have that extra piece of candy.


Move around instead of staying in the same place all day. Getting some mid-day exercise will keep you from feeling too bored.

, If most of your meals involve fast food, frozen dinners or packaged snacks, it’ll be hard to make a total transition to healthy eating right away. Try switching out just one meal a day for a wholesome home-cooked meal at first. You can gradually work your way up to eating healthy meals three times a day.


Some people prefer to quit eating junk food cold turkey, and that’s completely fine if you want to give it a try. However, be ready for some intense cravings and maybe even withdrawal symptoms, especially if you’re giving up sugar.

, It’s easier to indulge when you’re not quite sure what you’re eating. Make a habit of looking at not just the calorie count, but the ingredient lists of the foods you like to eat.


If the item has a short list of pure, natural ingredients, you’re probably good to go.
But if it has an ingredient list that’s over an inch long, it’s probably not that healthy for you, even if it’s labeled “low calorie.”

, Life wouldn’t be much fun if you never let yourself have your favorite dessert. Not only that, but you’d probably crave it all the time before finally giving in to a binge. Eating a little bit every once in a while is perfectly fine. It allows you to stay in control without feeling deprived.

, Let’s say you live for soda, and you hate the thought of having to give it up. Trick your brain a little by drinking carbonated water with a squeeze of lemon and a few drops of honey. While it won’t taste exactly as sweet as your favorite lemon-lime soda, it might be enough to help you get through your cravings. Try the following substitutions as well:


If you crave chocolate, eat a few pieces of dark chocolate that contains 70 percent cacao or higher. It’s low in sugar and gives you an excellent chocolate boost.
If you crave baked goods, roast a sweet potato and top it with a pat of butter and some cinnamon.
If you crave a fruity dessert, try plain fresh fruit topped with a slight drizzle of maple syrup or honey.
If you crave a salty snack, roast some pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds with your favorite seasonings.

, Having strong reasons for the choices you make is a great way to stay motivated. When you’re about to reach for that milkshake or bag of chips, think about why you want to stay healthy, lose weight, and feel better.


Thinking about your family is often a huge motivator. Maybe you want to have more energy to play with your kids.
For some people, it’s all about the future. Perhaps heart disease runs in your family and you want to make a change now.
Or it could be that the food you’ve been eating makes you feel unwell. You know that choosing an apple instead of a candy bar will help your stomach feel more settled.

, If you’ve struggled with eating junk food your whole life, there may be more to it than simply having trouble sticking to a diet. Many people turn to food as a way to cope with problems like depression or PTSD. If you think there may be an underlying cause, seek help from people who understand.

Consider getting therapy for help with your situation. If you have an eating disorder, it will be difficult to overcome on your own.
Look for online and in-person support groups to help you on your journey to wellness.

Determine your dietary goals and recommended daily caloric intake.,
Compare sample portion sizes to common items for estimating purposes.,
Apply the tips on individual food portion sizes to determine appropriate portion sizes for the components of each meal.,
Use dinner plate divisions to portion out servings for meals at home.,
Know how to identify foods that throw off calorie counts and portion sizes.",How to Learn About Portion Size," Your portion needs will depend on age, sex, activity level, and weight goals. Online interactive dietary planners and calorie calculators can help more closely estimate your necessary daily calorie intake and precise portion sizes.


For instance, women whose goal is weight loss can typically succeed with about 1600 calories per day. If weight loss is your goal, your portions will be moderate and will consist mainly of foods that are low calorie and high in nutrients.
For women trying to maintain weight, calorie needs may reach up to 2000 per day. Those who regularly exercise may need additional calories to avoid losing weight. Portion sizes can allow for some higher calorie foods, although it is often healthier to simply consume slightly larger portions of low calorie, nutrient-dense foods.
Men attempting to lose weight should typically aim for 2200 calories a day or a bit more, depending on activity level. Men trying to maintain weight should opt for approximately 2500 calories per day, and very active men may need 3000 calories per day.
Metabolism typically slows down with age. If you are older and typically inactive, slightly smaller than recommended portion sizes may still provide sufficient calories and nutrients for a healthy diet, particularly in combination with a multi-vitamin. Consult a dietitian if you have difficulty losing or maintaining weight for longer than a few months to receive assistance in creating an individualized calorie and portion size dietary plan.;
, Memorize the appropriate serving sizes for each type of food.


In general, the recommended serving size for meat, poultry, or fish is about the size of the palm of your hand or a deck of cards.
A single portion of grain products like rice or pasta would be comparable to the size of your fist. One cup (or an amount like that of your fist) is also the standard serving size for a portion of fruit or vegetables. In terms of everyday objects, this portion size can be compared to the size of a baseball.
The standard portion size for nut butters or other healthy fats are comparable to the size of a golf ball or your thumb. Pancakes should be the size of a CD, a portion of nuts or dried fruit would amount to a small handful, and raw leafy greens or popcorn would be two handfuls.
Drinks such as low-fat milk or milk alternatives and 100% fruit juice are also 1 cup per portion size, comparable to the size of a fist. Because sugary drinks like soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored coffees are typically of little nutritional value, any portion of these drinks should be limited.
Dozens of charts and tutorials offering simple tips for estimating appropriate portion sizes can be found for free on government, medical, nutrition, and even health-oriented magazine websites. Printing a chart or two and keeping it on the refrigerator for a few weeks can help reinforce the standard portion sizes for different types of food and gradually teach you about portion size.

,


First, categorize each food by its food group. Consulting a sample chart or using the tips found above, plan the serving size for each food in the meal. This may help in the planning stage of preparing food as well, since understanding appropriate portion sizes can help you figure out exactly how much food to buy and use in a recipe.
A meal should be built based on how many servings you need of each food group per day, which varies by age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. The United States Department of Agriculture can create customized daily and weekly serving amounts on their Daily Food Plan: Choose My Plate website found in the Sources section below.
Depending on calorie needs and your goals for losing, maintaining, or gaining weight, measure out portion size at each meal by the above sample portion size comparisons. Using standard portion sizes, you can help balance the meal and keep serving size in check.

, Using smaller plates, utensils, and cups can make it easier to measure portion sizes appropriately.


A 9"" dinner plate divided into 4 parts makes portion sizing easy and accurate; 1 quarter of the plate should typically be lean protein, 1 quarter should consist of grain products, and the remaining half should be vegetables (and fruit if you like). Those with higher calorie needs may need additional portions; opt for extra servings of vegetables or grains instead of proteins, fats, or dairy.
If one group takes more than its share of the plate, eat only what would classify as the appropriate portion of the plate. For instance, if a steak takes up half of the plate, eat only as much steak as fits in a quarter of the plate, and finish filling up on vegetables and whole grains. Even if your portion sizes are slightly off, filling the plate with healthy foods and avoiding foods high in fat, sodium, or sugar can help you keep calories and serving sizes in check.
Keep in mind that if you have large plates, the suggested portion size estimators will be essential to portion control. Monitoring portion size requires understanding the quantity to put on the plate in each quarter, not just what proportion of the plate to fill with which food group.
Apply sample portion tips to take-out and restaurant foods as well. Request regular or lunch-size portions in place of large or super-size portions (including drinks). If a restaurant does not offer portion size options, request that they put half of the meal in a take-home container before even serving it, so that you do not go overboard on portion sizes.

, Foods with high fat, salt, and sugar content may be best in smaller portions than provided in packages or restaurants.


For instance, a burger smothered in cheese sauce, onion rings, and a buttered bun may be best in a half-portion instead of the full burger. Similarly, salads from vendors and restaurants often contain multiple portions of protein, fat, vegetables, and dairy, so restrict the quantity of proteins and fats if you will have other protein and fat portions throughout the day.

Realize that exposure to aspergillus is not really a problem for healthy people.,
Understand that it is nearly impossible to avoid exposure to aspergillus.,
Know the different forms of aspergillosis.",How to Prevent Aspergillosis1," This is because aspergillosis primarily strikes people who have compromised immune systems. As a result, aspergillus and aspergillosis infection is not a substantial risk to healthy people. This is because healthy immune systems are typically able to fight off aspergillus mold relatively quickly., Aspergillus is all around us. It is in the air we breathe, in the homes and buildings we live and work in, and is even in some of the food items we eat. As a result, you should have realistic expectations about how you can minimize exposure to aspergillus and avoid aspergillosis., Aspergillosis, as an infection and disease, manifests in several forms. Each of these forms is more prone to strike individuals with different health problems. As a result, you need to evaluate your risk based on your general health level. Major forms of aspergillosis include:


Allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. This is an allergic reaction to aspergillus spores. People with outstanding lung problems like asthma are much more prone to this variety of aspergillosis.
Aspergilloma. This is when a fungus ball grows in an individual’s lung that has previously been scared by diseases like tuberculosis.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This is an infection that can ultimately lead to pneumonia. This infection afflicts people who have weakened immune systems like people with AIDS, cancer, or leukemia."

Many people at the end of their life wish they would have stepped out more on the tether rope of life. Don’t you be one of them! The key really is action.


Don’t bite off more than you can chew, though. Otherwise, you might quit. Small, incremental steps and consistency is how you accomplish big goals in life.

, Have you noticed that you love beautiful surroundings yet your personal space is a mess? Then start working on creating that gorgeous environment for yourself, and then invite your friends over when you’re done! Did your art teacher in school comment on the amazing artwork you would create? Even though you’ve thought about it, you still haven’t created one thing since graduation. So pick up some paints today, and start rendering those Picasso-like pieces that you have in your head!

, Each day, make a list of your three most important tasks (called MITs) that need to be completed in any given week. Make another list of smaller, less important tasks which, if you don’t do, could cause problems for you later on. These might include writing a brief letter, responding to emails, making calls, completing paperwork, etc. Set a time later in the day to do them all at once (say 4:30 p.m.). Then, start working on your MITs for the day, and when the time rolls around, do the smaller tasks.Towards the end of the day, take a look at what still needs to be done. Transfer tasks from the small list to the next day, and continue focusing on the MITs.
This method ensures that the bulk of your time isn’t consumed by tasks less important than the bigger priorities in your life.
Like anything new, it will take time to perfect, but stay with it. Eventually, you will be an expert at managing time versus it managing you!

Remodel your living space first - if you live in an artsy environment, you'll be surrounded by that mood.,
Your look is the next most important item to tackle - once you look artsy, and live in an artsy space, the rest will fall in to place much more easily!,
Adopt some of the little everyday habits that will make your lifestyle more artsy.,
Start reading.,
Start taking pictures.,
Take up another artsy hobby - like scrapbooking, painting, cooking, sketching, or fashion design.,
Give your iPod a makeover.,
Have passion.",How to Live an Artsy Lifestyle," Your room/home/apartment should inspire you and should actively portray the lifestyle that you want to live.


Infuse your space with colour - bright colours should pop out everywhere! Paint is cheap and can be used on almost anything ... so start painting! Don't worry about specific colour schemes - in fact, it shouldn't match.






Accessorize your walls. Photographs are fantastic. Try black and white pictures, in black frames with a white matte. Or, if you prefer a retro vibe, you could tape up groupings of Polaroids. Artwork is also a must - you could buy paintings from local artists, or buy from websites such as etsy.com. Alternately, you could create your own artwork with a canvas and a bit of paint - paint it a solid colour, or use simple stripes or letters for a simple, modern art look. Handprints/footprints of friends and family are another cool idea. Inspiration collages are another cool way to accessorize your walls - find magazine cutouts or Internet printouts of any images that inspire you in fashion, beauty, design, or photography and arrange them creatively. Chalkboard paint is also a great idea - it turns any surface into a chalkboard, which you can then use for doodling whenever the mood strikes you - and it's easy to erase afterwards! Try painting the back of a door using chalkboard paint. Unique mirrors or clocks are other great methods of accessorize walls in an artsy way.






Get comfy! Cushions can be thrown anywhere to give the appearance of a carefree, lived-in, cozy space. Find interesting ones at places like urbanoutfitters.com, or buy plain white ones and embellish them yourself with paint or cool prints. They can be tossed on chairs and couches, in corners for sitting on the floor, or piled on your bed to turn it into a chaise by day.






Books are a major must-have to fill your space with that artsy intrigue that you're after. Fashion, culture and design books make fantastic décor when piled on coffee tables or nightstands and provide great inspiration as well.






To keep your space feeling fresh and free, introduce some plants, or perhaps small and easy pets like fish. Fresh flowers should always be found around, found in colourful vases. Artsy glass fishbowls are great too, and a goldfish is incredibly low-maintenance. You could also try small living plants like mini bonsai trees - so cute, and you can trim them into unique shapes, so that yours is one-of-a-kind.






Christmas lights are a must for incredible mood-lighting. The classic white ones can come off as classy, not tacky, when done right. Try them over a window frame.





;
,


Consider your haircut first - Google images to figure out what you like. Essentially, what is most important is something that you feel reflects your personality. It should also be something that will make your hair hassle-free - if you have curly hair, learn to stop fighting it. If it's straight, try a shorter cut. Choppy bangs, long layers, super-short - basically anything goes. How you style your hair is more important - you shouldn't look too done up, and it shouldn't be a major stress.






If you wear make-up, simplify your makeup routine. Go through your makeup bag and throw out anything old, anything that you don't use, and anything trashy. Artsy girls may play around with their makeup - particularly with coloured liners and shadows - but for the most part you should try for a natural look. Foundation, blush, lip moisturizer, an eyelash curler, mascara, and clear gel for your eyebrows are all you really need on a daily basis.






Evaluate your wardrobe, and get rid of anything that you don't really like. When buying clothes, stay away from big name brands. You can, however, follow trends if they appeal to you. Make sure you have a go-to item for footwear - cute boots, ballerina flats, or converse. You should also try to find your statement ""thing"" - scarves, cardigans, and skinny jeans are all great. You could also try a big statement ring or a unique vintage necklace.







,


Drink tea or cappuccino often. A cup of tea is great in the morning, when you're curled up with a book, in bed, or when working.






Stop by the coffee shop in the morning on your way to school/work if possible.






Do little puzzles, like Sudoku or crosswords.






Keep a ""Keel's Simple Diary"" - it's like a cool, chic journal - with a quirky questionnaire everyday. It only takes a minute or two to fill out each night, and they can be purchased from most bookstores.






If possible, try to stop by the market weekly for fresh fruit or quirky scarves and jewelry.







, Read a lot. Novels, fashion memoirs, artsy culture magazines (try Nylon), and blogs (like thesartorialist.com and seaofshoes.blogspot.com). A book is the coolest accessory you could possibly have, so keep one in your purse.

, It doesn't matter if you aren't a photographer at heart - just make an effort to document the world around you. Try a photography project to help you stay motivated - such as a ""365"" (in which you take a photo every day for a year) or a ""stranger project"" (in which you try to take 'x' number of photos of complete strangers). If you have a professional DSLR, all the better. If it's just a point and shoot, don't worry - all photographers have to start somewhere.

, It should be something that interests you.

, Delete the old and tired, and try to find new music that's outside of the mainstream. Finding cool ""undiscovered bands"" is the pride of any true artsy girl. Websites like ilistentoeverything.com can help you, as can magazines. Soundtracks from T.V. shows can also lead you to cool music discoveries. ""Alternative"" and ""Indie"" are probably the main genres you'll want to keep an eye out for.

, Take up a cause, and don't be afraid to get involved. Most artsy-girls are interested in politics or the environment, and aren't afraid to fight for their position.

Keep your mouth clean.,
See your dentist regularly.,
Eat more yogurt and less sugar.,
Protect infants from thrush.",How to Prevent Candida Overgrowth2," Rinse your mouth frequently. Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily or as often as your dentist recommends. If you have to use a corticosteroid inhaler, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth after taking your medication. If you are undergoing treatment for cancer, some studies suggest that using a chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash can help to prevent thrush.If you have dentures, clean them daily. Ask your dentist for the best way to clean your type of dentures.

, If you have diabetes, wear dentures, or have had oral Candidiasis before, you may need to visit more frequently. Ask your dentist how often you should come in. Ask your dentist if you need to change your diet or oral hygiene routine., The bacteria in yoghurt may help you maintain a healthy bacteria balance in your mouth.It also might help to cut down on sweets and breads. It is possible that sugar and yeast encourage Candida overgrowth. Maintain good blood sugar control if you have diabetes. Well-controlled blood sugar can reduce the amount of sugar in your saliva, discouraging the growth of Candida.

, Small children are at risk for oral Candidiasis. Clean pacifiers and bottle nipples with hot water after each use. Store milk and prepared bottles in the fridge to prevent yeast from growing. If you are nursing and have red or sore nipples, you may be passing a yeast infection back and forth with your child. Talk to your doctor about obtaining an antifungal ointment for your nipples.Treat any vaginal yeast infections that develop during pregnancy as soon as possible.

Know when you're at risk.,
Take an antifungal medication.,
Keep an eye on hospital hygiene.",How to Prevent Candida Overgrowth3," Invasive Candidiasis occurs when excess Candida enters the bloodstream and causes an infection. Invasive Candidiasis is most likely to happen in hospital patients or residents of nursing homes. If you are in an intensive care unit or are using a catheter, you are at risk of invasive Candidiasis. Having a weakened immune system, low neutrophil, or diabetes can also put you at risk.


You may be at risk if you have taken broad-spectrum antibiotics, experienced kidney failure, or had surgery, especially gastrointestinal surgery., To prevent invasive Candidiasis, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal prophylaxis. If you have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant, you might be prescribed this. Ask about it as well if you are a high-risk ICU patient or a chemotherapy patient. If you have had an infant born at less than 2.2 pounds, ask about the rates of invasive Candidiasis at the hospital.


Your doctor may recommend that your infant be given an antifungal medication if the rates of infection are high., Medical equipment can carry traces of Candida. Workers in hospitals might carry traces of it on their hands. While staying in a hospital, make sure your hands are clean, and ask anyone who touches you to wash their hands first. If you are wearing a catheter, ask how long it should stay in, and speak up if it isn't changed on time. If the skin around the catheter becomes swollen, red, sensitive, or painful, tell a healthcare worker immediately."

Consult your doctor.,
Exercise care if you have a compromised immune system.,
Take prophylactic antifungal medication, if you have a compromised immune system.",How to Prevent Aspergillosis2," If you are worried about aspergillosis infection, make sure to consult your doctor. Ultimately, your doctor is your best resource in determining your risk level. As a result, if you are concerned about aspergillosis, you should maintain an on-going dialogue with your doctor.


Talk to your doctor about your risk level.
If your doctor determines you are high risk, make sure to see him or her regularly.
Inform your doctor if you’ve ever had an aspergillosis infection before., If you have a compromised immune system for any reason, you need to exercise extra care. This means you need to avoid certain activities or protect yourself when engaged in certain activities where aspergillus mold might be present.


While everyone should take precautions during yard work, a compromised immune system puts you at extra risk. It is advisable to hire someone to do yard work for you.
Anyone with a compromised immune system should where a face mask or respirator if they know they will be exposed to mold.
People with asthma or cystic fibrosis should always take extra precautions, as they are more susceptible to aspergillosis than those with a healthy immune system., Taking anti-fungal medication as a way of protecting yourself against expected exposure to aspergillus is one way to reduce risk and prevent aspergillosis. Anti-fungal medication will bolster your body and immune system against any aspergillus or other fungal agents you come in contact with. When considering prophylactic anti-fungal medication:


Talk to your doctor.
Think about any risk you will have in the near future.
Patients with compromised immune systems should consider this treatment if they will be outdoors in locations where they might be exposed to aspergillus, such as on vacation in a tropical climate.
Know that antifungal medication is not a long-term solution. In most cases, you should not take antifungals as a prophylactic for more than a few days to two weeks."

Take care in high risk regions or during certain times of the year.,
Avoid areas with decaying vegetation, if you are immunocompromised.,
Use a dust mask.,
Limit gardening and lawn work, if you are immunocompromised.,
Reduce your exposure to indoor buildings with mold.",How to Prevent Aspergillosis3," It is impossible to completely avoid aspergillus exposure, as it is present in all parts of the United States and throughout the world. However, it is most prevalent in warm and wet locations. As a result, certain regions and certain times of the year offer higher risk than others. If you are immunocompromised and at high risk for aspergillus infection, consider taking extra precautions in regions and during seasons where/when aspergillus is particularly prevalent.


Certain regions like the Northwest or Southeast United States are much more hospitable to aspergillus. The wet season in these regions is a particular time when aspergillus may be prevalent.
While regions like the American Southwest may be less hospitable to aspergillus, the fungus is still present there.
Aspergillus grows best in a range between 53 degrees Fahrenheit and 149 degrees Fahrenheit., Areas with lots of decaying vegetation are areas with increased risk of aspergillus. When you are in these areas, you are more likely to be exposed to large amounts of aspergillus fungal spores. Such exposure can increase the chance of you developing aspergillosis if you have a severely weakened immune system.


Watch out for wooded areas with decaying branches, leaves, and other organic material.
If you are an avid hiker or outdoors person, frequent areas that are open and where natural air circulation is better., If you need to be in a moldy building or in high risk areas outdoors, you should use a dust mask. Wearing a dust mask can drastically cut down on exposure to aspergillus spores that may be in the air or put into the air by human activity. As a result, anyone looking to limit exposure to aspergillus should wear a dusk mask.


Dusk masks can be purchased at local hardware or big box stores.
Some masks offer more protection than others. HEPA masks are perhaps the best solution, but they can be pricey. Other less expensive masks still offer a level of protection.
Masks range in cost from less than a dollar to twenty or thirty for high-end HEPA masks.
To use a dusk mask, carefully put it over your mouth and nose. Secure any nose clamp or other methods of fastening and closing the mask. Make sure the mask is snug on your face and you can breath easily., Another major activity that puts immunocompromised people at risk of coming into contact with aspergillus is gardening and lawn work. As a common type of mold, aspergillus is found all around us in nature. If you have a severely weakened immune system as a result of certain types of illnesses or medications, consider limiting outdoor work so you can prevent aspergillosis.


Watch out for decaying vegetation when working in your garden.
Consider having a lawn care company mow your lawn and take care of your landscaping.
Exercise extra care if you have a compost pile in your backyard. Compost piles are excellent habitats for aspergillus.
Plan gardening and lawn work for cool and low humidity days., One of the best ways to reduce your overall risk of an aspergillosis infection is to limit exposure to indoor environments that contain mold, as aspergillus is a common type of mold. Indoor areas offer extra risk because of potentially limited ventilation and low air. Take the following steps:


Do not enter buildings that may have mold growth.
Wear a filter/dust mask when working or playing in dusty environments.
If you have any concern about a building that may have mold, avoid it."
"
Make sure your home is cool and has low humidity.,
Monitor the air quality in your home (and at work).,
Use an air purifier or HEPA filtration system.",How to Prevent Aspergillosis4," If you have a compromised immune system, one way to lower your risk of aspergillosis is to create an environment in which it does not thrive. You can do this by making sure your home air conditioner is working well, and your humidity is relatively low as well. Make sure to:


Set your air conditioner to 75 or lower.
Monitor your humidity and take steps to keep it below 50%.
Stay proactive about maintaining your air conditioning unit., Another good way to lower your risk of aspergillosis is to monitor the air quality in your home or at work. Testing your air quality will let you know if there are mold or other fungal spores in your air. As a result, you’ll know better how to mitigate any risks associated with aspergillus and aspergillosis infection.


Test your air quality every year to six months.
Contact a home inspector that can run air quality tests.
Air quality tests can cost from between $50 to $200, depending on how many rooms you are testing.
Air quality test kits are also available through mail order at your local hardware store., One great way to prevent aspergillosis at home is to use an air purifier or have a HEPA filtration system running at all times. This way, the air purifier and HEPA system will filter out dangerous aspergillus out of the air you breathe.


Have a professional install an air filtration system in your home.
If you can’t afford an installed system, buy an air filter and keep it in areas of the house you frequent.
Use a portable air filtration system at work."

Take on a new fitness challenge.,
Volunteer for an organization that does meaningful work.,
Start making and baking things in your kitchen.,
Trace your family tree.",How to Live Life2," Consider incorporating a 30-day fitness challenge into your routine. It’s a terrific way to supplement your regular workout regimen. Most challenges only take 20 to 30 minutes a day to complete; however, you’ll be considerably more active than you usually are. The reason 30-day fitness regimens typically have good results is because they entail 5 SMART principles, which means they are time-bound, specific, achievable, relevant and measurable.Think about doing a plank, kettlebell swing, or pushup challenge. The choice is yours based on what part of the body you wish to train the most. Keep in mind, however, that a 30-day fitness challenge is not meant to replace your normal routine. In theory, you’re supposed to still maintain what you’re doing regularly. You will probably be a little sore at first but, by the end, you should be moving right along with both routines, not to mention in much better shape.
Here’s an example of how to incorporate the SMART principles using kettlebells:
Specific - I’m going to do a 30-day fitness challenge incorporating kettlebell swings.
Measurable - I will do 500 swings 20 times within 30 days in order to reach 10,000 swings total.
Achievable - I will reach my goal by breaking them down into 5 rounds each with sets of 10, 15, 25 and 50 repetitions.
Relevant - I wish to build the core part of my body, and this is one of the best ways to do it.
Time-bound - My goal is to reach 10,000 swings within 30 days.Consider training for either a 5K or for a smaller event. This has become a huge sport with almost too many benefits to list here. Signing up for one will help you stay in shape, get your competitive juices flowing, hone your discipline, and you’ll meet lots of people. If you haven’t run in one before or you’re a little out of shape, consider participating in a shorter run, or only do the walk portion of the event. You should be able to find a 5K event where you live. If not, find out where a race is being held, train every day or every other day for 30 days, and go there.

, Volunteering gives you new skills while putting into practice ones you’ve already developed. It’s also a great way to meet new people, and you’ll be participating in worthwhile activities with other like-minded people. Further, you’ll be helping to make change in an area you’re passionate about.Think about volunteering with kids. There are lots of areas you can delve into here. You can participate in a youth group, be a mentor, help out in juvenile detention, or work with one of the big scouting organizations. This could be a ideal direction to go in if you’re planning on becoming a youth worker or a teacher.Offer your time at a local animal shelter. If you want instant gratification, do this. There is nothing like a scrawny puppy with big eyes looking up at you as your putting food in his bowl to make you feel good. You could also work in fund-raising – an area that’s highly needed in animal rescue work, train to be a vet’s assistant, or work in the field picking up stray cats and dogs. Just like the rewards, the choices are endless.

, Your family and friends will probably like this new hobby of yours a lot. You can make yummy jams, tasty pickles, or become a cupcake aficionado. Once you’ve got the recipes down, think about entering your scrumptious creations in a local taste contest or one of the fairs in your area.


You can also make homemade beer. If you can boil water, you can brew beer – even premium, at the fraction of the cost of commercial beer. Home brewing beer has come a long way since it was first legalized in 1979. (A one-person household can make 100 gallons a year and a family household can make 200 gallons.) Over the years, the techniques have been refined and the variety and quality of supplies and brewing ingredients that are available practically ensure great results. These days home brewing has reached a state of high science. But, you don't have to practice at that high a level to make a tasty beer.Brewing is an inexact and forgiving science, which allows for experimentation.
To learn, just look online or in your local book store. Each will describe a different procedure for fermenting and brewing and will include recipes unlike the rest. Interestingly, most of them produce terrific results.
Finding the ingredients and equipment for home brewing is not the big challenge it used to be. Chances are good even that there’s a beer-making store where you live. If not, you can get everything you need by mail.

, This fascinating topic is called genealogy. There are plenty of courses available online on how to chart yours (or other people’s) family history. It can take time to do it properly, but when it’s finished, it’s a keepsake your whole family will appreciate. It also makes a great gift for one or more of your relatives. There isn’t a limit in how far back you can go.Keep in mind you need to be fairly detailed oriented and have a detective-type mind to be able to do a thorough and accurate genealogy report.
Begin recording what you already know about your family. Start with yourself and enter as much information as possible. Preserve important stories and family information by developing a family tree generation by generation. Record marriage and death dates, names, birth dates, and other facts that you know.

Learn to tolerate uncertainty and possible rejection.,
Wander into the unknown, even if you fall on your face.",How to Live Life3," No successful person has gotten where they are without pushing through “perceived” limitations and failures. Winston Churchill flunked the sixth grade. Oprah Winfrey was told she wasn’t fit enough for television. Colombia Pictures thought that Marilyn Monroe wasn’t pretty enough, and Walt Disney was told he lacked imagination! However, none of these individuals sat around and sulked in their apparent faults. They went out and made it happen and you can, too!, Join a group that has the same interests as you, like veganism or chess. When you see someone you would like to meet, be natural and ask him or her about something that pertains to the moment. Does this cheese have rennet or is it a vegan cheese? Volunteering is another great way to meet people. It gets you out of your normal routine and helping others is a good feeling, too.

, For all kinds of reasons, someone may not want to get to know you, and you may never know why. Try not to take it personally because they really don’t know you. Perhaps he or she is a particular religion or race and has been raised to only become friends with people from his or her community.

, It’s okay to fail. It’s how we learn what works and what doesn’t. Whether it’s an inspired idea, a blind date or an unexpected career opportunity, embrace it as a chance to grow. Too many people live in fear, and never tap into how great they really are!


Most people have lots of opinions. Take into consideration what others say, but you don’t always have to believe what they say about you. Often, it’s just projections based on their own fears!
Many are fine going unnoticed in the world, not straying from the opinions of others, and not ruffling any feathers. On the inside, though, these are the ones hoping for positive change. Be the lone duck from the crowd, and stay true to yourself. As long as you’re not hurting anyone or yourself, then it’s fine.The most important thing is you tried. It takes confidence to put yourself out there, so pat yourself on the back for it! There are many people on the planet. Eventually, you will find your tribe.

Read travel blogs.,
Peruse travel forums.",How to Live Life4," While there are some pricey hotspots in the world, these three countries are doable if you’re on a budget. You can visit one of them for two weeks for about $500, excluding airfare. This covers accommodation, drinks, food, transportation and other on-the-ground expenses.Thailand is popular and for good reason. Cheap dining and accommodations, inexpensive trains and buses, beautiful mountains and beaches, and a happening metropolis in Bangkok all contribute to the perfect destination place for the budget traveler.
Vietnam is another great place to make your money to go far, and it’s a beautiful country with so much to offer. Accommodation is inexpensive while still being comfortable and clean, the food is some of the best and cheapest in the world, and traveling by bus means you will save a fortune.
As a backpacker destination, Laos has been gaining in popularity in recent years but the costs are still within reason. This stunning part of the world is known for its laid-back lifestyle and its gorgeous scenery., Ask yourself, do you love what you do? If it isn’t a loud, enthusiastic YES, then it may be time to do something about it! First, sell everything that you don’t absolutely need. Two, save at least one or two months’ salary. And three, either volunteer your services, teach English online, or teach at an actual school in a developing country.Believe it or not, there are a lot of companies, individuals and non-profits looking for all kinds of help in developing countries. You could volunteer in an administrative capacity at a Tibetan school in India, on a coffee farm in Honduras, or on a horse ranch in Mexico. The choice really is yours.
There are several big websites that regularly post ads for people, companies and NGOs that are looking for volunteers. Though they don’t pay, most cover room and board. You just have to get there and have some money for living expenses each month.
You can also teach English online or at an actual school abroad. If you teach online, you can either freelance or work through a company. If it’s through a company, they may require you to have an “English as a Foreign Language” (EFL) certificate, which is only a short, inexpensive course. There are also hundreds of schools on the Internet canvassing for teachers on a regular basis – entry level or experienced; many require an EFL certificate but some do not. Most provide room, board and a decent salary. The biggest criteria for teaching EFL are patience, creativity, organizational skills and English fluency.

, Most of these writers are not being to paid to write. So you will usually get a personal, honest glimpse into what a country looks like. Since you’re on a budget, veer towards backpacking blogs. Along with giving you a frank portrait, many also give lots of details on what things cost.

, Many travelers sharing on websites have just come from your future destination, are genuine and want to help. Though take what they say with a grain of salt. It’s part of human nature to filter memories through a few specific events, negative ones usually."

Look for small, red sores on your scalp.,
Note any red blisters on your face, neck, or hands.,
Check for groin ringworm.,
Look for red and flaky rashes between your toes.,
Practice good gym and locker room hygiene.,
Do not share hair brushes, combs, towels, clothing, or other personal care items.,
Get your pets checked for ringworm.",How to Know if You Have Ringworm," Ringworm can cause small patches of scaly skin on the scalp to develop. These spots may be sore and itchy.Sometimes scaly skin can be an indication you have dandruff, not ringworm. If you start to notice this symptom, get your scalp examined by a dermatologist to determine if you have a ringworm infection.;
, Hair loss caused by ringworm starts in small patches that are generally the size of a coin. As the disease progresses, the hair loss spot will start to grow in size and may form a ring shape, hence the name “ringworm”.Your hair may break off, leaving stubble that looks like small black dots. The bald patches may be scaly and swollen.

, As scalp ringworm progresses, small, pus-filled sores can begin to develop on the scalp, called a kerion. The skin may also begin to ""crust"" —it will look like very dry flaky skin that you can peel off. These are all signs that the infection has gotten worse and requires immediate medical care.If you have oozing and tender sores on your scalp, you should get them treated right away as they can cause permanent scarring and hair loss.
If you have a kerion, you may also develop a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Your body will try to fight the ringworm by raising the temperature of your body, leading to a fever. Your lymph nodes will also swell as they try to get the infection out of your blood., Body ringworm can appear on your face, your neck, and your hands, often in the form of red blisters in a ring shape.If you have ringworm on your face and neck, you may have itchy, swollen skin that becomes dry and crusty; however, these symptoms may not appear in a ring shape. If you develop beard ringworm, you may notice chunks of hair are missing from your beard.
Hand ringworm can cause the skin of your palms and your fingers to appear thicker or raised. It may affect one hand or both hands, and your hands may appear normal on one side and thicker or raised on the other side.
In more severe cases, the red blisters on your body can spread, grow in size and merge. These blisters will be slightly raised when touched and very itchy. Pus filled sores may also start to develop around the rings.

, Groin ringworm, also known as Jock Itch, is a type of body ringworm that generally forms around the inner thighs and buttocks. Look for red or brown sores in these areas, though they may not appear in the shape of a ring. These sores may also be pus filled.You may also have large patches of red or itchy skin in your inner thigh and buttocks areas. However, ringworm will generally not affect the genital area.

, In the case of foot ringworm, also known as Athlete’s Foot, rashes will appear between your toes. You will also most likely experience an itching sensation that you can’t seem to get rid of. As the ringworm continues to progress, you may begin to feel a burning or stinging sensation on your feet and toes.You should also check the soles and sides of your feet for flakiness that resembles scales. If your ringworm has progressed this far, you should seek immediate medical care.
You can also get ringworm in your nails, also known as a fungal nail infection. Your nails may turn black, white, yellow, or green, they may turn brittle and fall off, or the skin around your nails may become sore., Like many fungal infections, ringworm thrives in moist environments. Limit your exposure to ringworm by wearing shower shoes in the locker room and washing your hands before and after every workout. You should also always wipe down gym equipment, including workout mats, before and after use to prevent the spread of an infection.As soon as you are done with your workout, you should change out of your gym clothes so you are not wearing sweaty clothing that can allow fungi to thrive and grow. You should also never share your towel when you workout and wash all clothing and towels after every use.
If you swim at a public pool, you should practice good locker room and pool hygiene. Always wear shoes in the showers and shower before and after you go into the water.
Make sure you dry off completely after showering.

, Prevent the spread of ringworm by not lending out any personal care items, especially if ringworm has been going around your classroom or your office. Keep your hair brushes, combs, sporting equipment, and towels clean so you do not encourage the growth of fungus like ringworm., If your pet has fur or hair, she may have bald spots in her fur or hair, as well as red blisters or scaly skin. Take your pet to the vet to check her for ringworm, as you can contract ringworm from an infected pet.Avoid touching your pet if she has ringworm and wear gloves around her. You should also wash your hands before and after touching any animal in the event they are carrying a fungal infection.

Wear comfortable, cotton under garments.",How to Heal Cervicitis," In some women, cervicitis produces no symptoms; you may not realize you have it until a doctor notices a problem during a routine gynaecological exam. However, many women do notice symptoms. These include:Abnormal vaginal discharge that has an odor or is a gray or yellow color.
Spotting between menstrual periods or after sexual intercourse.
A feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen, especially during sex.
A burning or itchy sensation when you urinate.;
, The symptoms of cervicitis can easily be confused with the symptoms of other conditions, so do not attempt to diagnose cervicitis yourself. Consult your primary care physician or gynecologist if you suspect you may have cervicitis. If your doctor suspects cervicitis, she will perform a standard pelvic exam, using a speculum to examine your cervix.If your pelvic exam reveals cervicitis, your doctor will order the appropriate laboratory tests to confirm the cervicitis and determine its cause. These tests may include a culture of your cervical discharge, a culture of the cervical cells themselves, blood tests, and, if you are sexually active, tests for sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhoea and chlamydia.

, With the right tests, your doctor should be able to identify the cause of your cervicitis. There are two different kinds of cervicitis: infectious (also known as “acute”) and noninfectious (also known as “chronic”). Infectious cervicitis and noninfectious cervicitis have different possible causes and therefore require different treatment regimens.Infectious cervicitis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia. It is usually treated with antibiotic medication.
Noninfectious cervicitis can be caused by a number of things, including foreign objects, such as intrauterine devices and cervical caps, an allergic reaction to latex due to sexual intercourse with latex condoms, and douches, vaginal washes, and other products that can irritate the vagina and cervix. It is usually treated with antibiotics and with removal of the offending agent.

, If you have infectious cervicitis caused by a a sexually transmitted disease like gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or syphilis, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.If you have gonorrhoea, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone, which can be administered in a single injection of 250 milligrams. In complicated or advanced infections, you may need stronger doses and/or additional oral antibiotics. Your doctor may also prescribe Azithromycin or Doxycycline, which are used to treat chlamydia. This step is taken because patients are often infected with both STIs.If you have chlamydia, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Azithromycin, which can be taken in a single oral dose of 1 gram. Alternatively, she may prescribe Erythromycin, Doxycycline, or Ofloxacin; these drugs are typically taken for seven days. Additionally, your doctor will prescribe Ceftriaxone to treat gonorrhoea, as the two infections often co-exist.If you have trichomoniasis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic called Flagyl, which can be administered in a single dose.If you have syphilis, your doctor will prescribe penicillin. A one-time dose should be sufficient to cure syphilis in its early stages, when the infection is less than one year old. For more advanced cases, you may also need additional injections or other treatments. If you are allergic to penicillin, your doctor will prescribe Azithromycin., If you have infectious cervicitis caused by a virus, such as genital herpes, your doctor will prescribe antiviral medications to treat the virus.If you have genital herpes, your doctor will prescribe the antiviral drug Acyclovir, which is taken for five days. Alternatively, she may prescribe Valacyclovir or Famciclovir, used for three days and one day, respectively. If you have a severe or complicated case, you may need additional treatments and/or increased dosages. Keep in mind genital herpes is a chronic, lifelong infection and you will need to treat the disease continually once you contract it., If you are treated for an STI, all of your partners need to be tested and treated, too. Sexually transmitted infections can be present in men and women without producing any symptoms at all, and untreated carriers of STIs can easily re-infect you in the future. Make sure all your previous sexual partners see a doctor., It’s important that you also tell your doctor if you are pregnant (or may possibly become pregnant), breastfeeding, or dealing with any other health issues before you are prescribed any medication. Contact your doctor if you have adverse reactions to your medication, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and rashes.Cervicitis can become a serious, long term problem if it is not treated with the right medication and given time to heal properly. With the right medication and treatment, you can make a full recovery from cervicitis. However, if you have genital herpes, you will need to commit to lifelong management of this chronic infection., If you have persistent non-infectious cervicitis, you may need to address the problem surgically with cryosurgery, also called freeze therapy.Cryosurgery involves the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissue. A cryoprobe, which is an instrument that contains liquid nitrogen, is inserted into the vagina. The cold compressed nitrogen makes the metal instrument cold enough to destroy the diseased tissues. Freezing is done for three minutes. The cervix is then allowed to thaw, and freezing is repeated for another three minutes.
Cryosurgery is relatively painless, but you may experience cramping, bleeding, and, in more serious cases, infection and scarring. For two to three weeks after your surgery, you can expect to notice a watery discharge. This is caused by the shedding of dead cervical tissue.

, Another possible surgical treatment for persistent non-infectious cervicitis is cauterization, also called heat therapy.Cauterization is an outpatient procedure that burns away the inflamed or infected cells. You will lie on your back with your legs in stirrups, and a speculum will be inserted into the vagina to hold it open. The cervix is then cleansed using a vaginal swab, and a heated probe is used to destroy the diseased tissues.
Anesthesia may be used to prevent discomfort before cauterization. You may experience cramping, bleeding, and watery discharge for up to four weeks. Call your doctor, however, if the discharge has an offensive smell, or if the bleeding is heavy.

, A third possible surgical treatment for persistent non-infectious cervicitis is laser therapy.Laser therapy is typically done in an operating room under general anesthesia and involves the use of an intense laser beam/light to burn/destroy abnormal tissues. A speculum is inserted into the vagina to hold it open. The laser beam is directed toward any abnormal tissue.
Anesthesia will limit your discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you may notice cramping and bloody, watery discharge for two to three weeks. Call your doctor if this discharge has an offensive smell, or if you notice increased bleeding or pelvic pain.

, You cannot cure cervicitis without medical care, especially if the cervicitis is infectious. However, you can take steps at home to make yourself more comfortable and help the prescribed treatments to work effectively. It’s important that you abstain from sexual activity until your doctor confirms you have healed from the infection.If your cervicitis is infectious, you need to avoid spreading the bacteria or virus; even if your cervicitis is non-infectious, avoid having sexual intercourse as this could further irritate your cervix and make your symptoms worse.

, Do not use products that may cause additional irritation or inflammation to your vagina or your cervix, including tampons and douching.Use menstrual pads instead of tampons.
Do not use scented soaps, sprays, or lotions. These and other products may cause irritation.
Do not use a diaphragm for birth control.

, Avoid tight, constricting underwear made of synthetic fabrics, as this can cause irritation and a buildup of moisture in the genital area. Look for 100% cotton undergarments to allow your genital area to breath and stay clean."

Experiment with colloidal silver.,
Keep your skin clean and dry.,
Wash clothes, sheets and towels regularly.,
Avoid touching pets with bald spots.",How to Get Rid of Ringworm Naturally," Tea tree oil is made from the leaves of the tea tree, which is native to Australia. It has been used for many generations as an ointment to fight all sorts of skin injuries and infections, including fungal and bacterial. According to research, tea tree oil applied to the skin is an effective remedy for ringworm, particularly athlete’s foot (tinea pedis). Topical creams with 10% tea tree oil can relieve the scaling, inflammation, itching and burning of athlete's foot, but stronger solutions (at least 25%) are needed to cure the rash.


You may need to apply tea tree oil 3x per day for up to 4 weeks to get rid of your ringworm rash. Be warned that it has a strong odor, similar to pine trees.
Concentrated tea tree oil solutions don't seem to be quite as effective as medicated anti-fungal creams that contain clotrimazole or terbinafine.;
, Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) is made from the seeds, pulp and white membranes of grapefruits. It has antimicrobial properties, including being a decent natural antibacterial and anti-fungal agent.GSE is sometimes used to combat Candida yeast (fungal) infections with good results, although there is no research that shows it's helpful in fighting ringworm infections. Regardless, it's safe for consuming or dabbing on the skin, so it may be worth a try.


GSE is safe for the skin and applying to your scalp — in fact, it's a relatively common ingredient in natural shampoos. Let it soak into your scalp for at least 5 minutes before rinsing it out.
Make your own by grinding up grapefruits and adding some glycerin, or buy from a health store that sells herbal remedies. Apply it to your ringworm rash 3-5x daily for up to a week and see if it's significantly better.

, Garlic cloves contain a compound called allicin, which has many medicinal properties, including being a natural antibacterial and anti-fungal.There are several studies that report garlic oil / gel is helpful for treating a variety of ringworm infections, such jock itch and athlete's foot.Rub garlic oil onto your rash 3-5x daily for up to a week and gauge progress. If it's improved, but still there, continue for another week.


Garlic oil can be made at home by crushing or pulverizing fresh garlic cloves. Alternatively, it can be purchased at a health store that sells herbal remedies.
The downside to using fresh garlic is that it has a strong odor and it can tingle or even irritate the skin in people who are sensitive.
Consider applying it to your athlete's foot at night, then covering your feet with socks to prevent it from rubbing off onto your sheets.

, Borax powder, also called sodium borate, is commonly used as a laundry detergent and insecticide. It's essential a salt compound of boric acid and a rich source of the mineral boron. Borax has many uses and properties, including being a strong anti-fungal.It's used to treat Candida infections of the skin, so it may also be effective for ringworm. Add a few cups of borax powder to a bath and soak your entire body for 15-20 minutes. If you are combating athlete's foot, then add a teaspoon or two to a warm foot bath.


Powdered borax consists of soft white crystals that easily dissolve in water. It has a very mild chemical odor and doesn't irritate the skin.
Make a more concentrated solution (or paste) and apply it to the ringworm infection on your scalp. Let it soak in for at least 5 minutes before rinsing.
Boric acid can decrease libido and sperm count in men —men should limit their exposure.

, You can use apple cider vinegar topically or ingest it to treat ringworm. It has antibacterial properties that may help get rid of ringworm. Dilute the vinegar with 1 cup of water per every teaspoon. Apply it to the rash using a cotton swab or cotton ball two to three times a day.If you choose to ingest it, try 1 teaspoon of vinegar in 1 cup of water twice daily.

, The active ingredient in black walnut (juglone) is an effective antifungal. Black walnut also contains tannins, which is an anti-fungal as well.Apply a black walnut tincture to the rash three times daily.
Avoid black walnut if you have liver or kidney disease or are pregnant or breastfeeding.

, Iodine is an antiseptic that kills bacteria an may also kill the fungus responsible for ringworm. Buy an iodine solution with 2% iodine but no higher or it may irritate your skin. Once you have cleansed the area with soap and water, apply the iodine to the area using a cotton swab or cotton ball.

You can apply three times daily but iodine should not be used for longer than 10 days., Silver solutions and compounds have a long and documented history of killing microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Before the discovery of penicillin, silver preparations were common and widely praised by medical doctors. Colloidal silver solutions are tasteless and odorless and contain clusters of silver atoms suspended in distilled water. Silver is deadly to some fungi and yeast, although there's no research on its effectiveness against ringworm.Given its long track record and excellent safety profile, it's worth experimenting with.


Colloidal silver can be purchased at most health food stores. Get solutions that contain between 5-10 parts per million (ppm) of silver — stronger solutions are not any more effective, but they're more expensive.
You can dab or spray the silver onto your rash 3-5x daily for a couple of weeks before deciding how effective it is.
It's easy to make colloidal silver at home and save money, although the equipment costs between $50-100 USD to get started.
Ingesting too much colloidal silver can turn your skin blue, but you would need to ingest at least two to four grams for this to happen., Ringworm often spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact with infected people.Thus, it makes sense to keep your skin clean so the fungus isn't able to flourish and burrow into your skin. Fungi also like moisture and darkness, so drying your skin is important, particularly your feet after taking a shower. Regular bathing with soap and water is usually enough to avoid ringworm infections.


Always wear foot protection (slippers or thongs) when showering in public places, such as the local gym or swimming pool, in order to prevent athlete's foot.
After reproducing on your skin, ringworm fungi burrows deeper and forms a flat scaly area, which may be red and itchy.The patch then develops a slightly raised border that expands into a circular ring.

, Ringworm also spreads by coming into contact with infected clothes, bedding and toiletries.Therefore, if you think you've come into contact with someone with a ringworm infection, make sure to wash your clothes immediately. If your partner has a fungal infection, then regularly wash your bedding and towels to reduce your risk of getting it.


Wash your clothes, bedding and towels with borax powder in hot water in order to kill fungi effectively. Chlorine bleach and benzalkonium chloride are also good fungicides.
Avoid sharing personal items such as your clothes, shoes, towels and hairbrushes to reduce your risk of ringworm.

, Ringworm also spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact with infected pets and other animals.Most commonly, the fungi spreads while petting or grooming your dogs or cats — it's also relatively common among cows and some other farm animals. As such, avoid touching pets or other animals that have the telltale sign of ringworm: bald spots without hair. The skin will also appear flaky, red and irritated.


You should always wash your hands after touching your pets or other animals, especially before eating and going to bed.
Sleeping with your pets is especially risky for getting ringworm and other skin conditions due to the proximity.
If you know your pet has ringworm, wear latex gloves and long sleeves when handling them and regularly vacuum the areas of your home they frequent.

Avoid further contamination.,
Use conventional medications.,
Try homeopathic treatments.",How to Get Rid of Foot Fungus1," This common infection affects the skin of your toes and soles. Because feet come into contact with floors used by many people (at home or in a sports facility), the infection can be spread easily and quickly.Don’t share shoes or towels with anyone.
Avoid walking barefoot in locker rooms, public swimming pools, communal showers, or gyms.
Wear flip-flops or shower shoes when showering until the infection is cured.
Keep your laundry separate so items like socks and bedsheets don’t contaminate other laundry.Keep surfaces of home bathing facilities clean.
Put on clean, dry socks every day or more often if necessary (such as after playing sports).;
, For mild cases, an over-the-counter medication can be an effective treatment. For more severe cases, prescription medications may be necessary.


Apply antifungal ointment, spray, powder, or cream.
Take an over-the-counter medication. Examples include butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra), clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF), miconazole (Desenex, Zeasorb, others), terbinafine (Lamisil AT), and tolnaftate (Tinactin, Ting, others).
For severe cases, get a prescription medication. Topical medications include clotrimazole and miconazole; oral medications include itraconazole (Sporanox), fluconazole (Diflucan) and terbinafine (Lamisil). Note that these oral medications can interfere with other medications such as antacid therapies and some anticoagulants.

, Several non-conventional treatments are thought to be effective for fighting skin and nail fungal infections.


Use tea tree oil, applied in a light coating to the affected areas two to three times a day—use products that are 100% tea tree oil.Apply grapefruit seed extract, which is thought to have antifungal properties when used in full strength—find this product at stores specializing in natural food and bath products.
Expose your infected foot to sunlight and fresh air—wear open shoes such as sandals and keep your feet dry and clean.
Treat with garlic, which contains antifungal compounds shown to be effective against a number of fungal infections including athlete’s foot. Finely crush several garlic cloves, add them to a foot bath, and soak your foot for 30 minutes. Alternatively, mix freshly-minced garlic with olive oil and rub it on the affected area with a cotton ball."

See your doctor.",How to Kickstart Your Metabolism Through Diet," Protein is the main nutrient needed for muscle development. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue. Increasing your muscle mass helps you not only to lose weight but also improves your metabolism. To get more protein in your diet, incorporate more meat proteins into your daily routine. These should be high quality lean meats that contain complete proteins, which contain the amino acids necessary for muscle production.Try to get hormone and antibiotic free meat and grass fed beef when possible. Good meats include:Lean, skinless poultry, including chicken and turkey
Lean ground turkey
Lean ground beef or trimmed cuts of beef
Buffalo trimmed of excess fat
Lean pork trimmed of excess fat
Fish, including tuna, salmon, sardines and mackerel;
, In addition to meat proteins, you can consume protein in many other forms. This is especially helpful if you are a vegetarian or if you have health conditions that require you to limit your meat intake. Plant-based proteins also contain complete amino acids that will help with muscle growth. Incorporate more of these into your diet every day. These foods include:Eggs and egg whites
Nuts and seeds
Dairy products, such as low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese
Soy products, such as tofu and soy milk
Lentils, peas and beans, falafel
Hearty grains, such as oats and quinoa
Skimmed milk powder that can be added into milk shakes, soups, sauces, gravies, casseroles, etc.
Whey protein powder
Quorn

, The healthiest form of fats you can consume is omega-3 fats. Omega-3 fats reduce inflammation, which helps with excess fat, which is one of the most common types of inflammation. They also help balance blood sugar levels and regulate your overall metabolism.


Omega-3s are also thought to help regulate the response to certain hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, that are instrumental to the control of hunger and weight.
These are found in many fish, including salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel, and sardines. They can also be found in flaxseed oil, walnut oil, and borage oils., Whole foods are foods that are not processed, which are those foods that are found in nature (such as whole fruits and vegetables). These foods are more complex and have more nutrients, which means it takes more energy and burns more calories as you digest them. By choosing whole foods, you force your body to work harder.Keep in mind the term ""processed"" can refer to many things — spinach that is washed and bagged, for instance, is considered processed. Minimal processing like this (or cutting up veggies, etc.) is fine. Just try to avoid highly processed foods such as fast foods or foods that are boxed and contain a lot of preservatives and additives.

, Although some easily digestible foods, such as smoothies, are good for you, avoid them if you are trying to kickstart your metabolism. Smoothies are easy for your body to digest, which means it works less to digest them. Instead, eat more complex foods that will make your body work harder to digest them.


Also avoid other soft foods, such as bananas, yogurt, and pudding.
These easily digestible foods should be limited to one a day, such as an add on smoothie with your breakfast or a yogurt cup for a snack.

, The best way to keep your metabolism active all day is to get active in the morning and intake most of your calories before 4 pm. This is so your body can digest your food properly and pep up your metabolism more. If you eat too many calories after this time, you won’t burn as many calories because your metabolism slows down as you sleep.


This means any excess calories can be turned into fat.
Never skip breakfast if you are trying to boost your metabolism. It is hard to get the right nutrients and boost your metabolism if you don’t eat early in the day.
Incorporate high quality, lean, and complete protein with your breakfast to ensure that your metabolism is super charged throughout the day, especially if you work out early in the morning. It also helps keep hunger down throughout the day., If you are trying to reduce your daily intake of calories, avoid doing so too quickly. When you cut your daily caloric intake too much at one time, your body responds by going into famine mode. This means your body conserves calories and actually lowers your BMR.A healthy way around this reaction is to calculate the amount of calories you need to maintain your BMR, which you can do with an online calculator. Measure the amount of calories you currently eat every day, then cut it by 10% every week or two until you match the caloric intake needed to maintain your BMR.

, The best way to increase body metabolism is to increase exercise levels. To kickstart your metabolism, increase your daily physical activity. This will make your body work more, which will burn more calories and increase your BMR. It also helps you build muscles, which will help your burn even more calories and increase your BMR even more.


When you increase your physical activity along with providing your body with quality nutrients, you help kickstart your metabolism into burning more calories more efficiently.Try incorporating more movement into your daily life. For instance, at work you can walk to colleagues to talk instead of emailing or messaging, walk or ride a bike to work, walk on your lunch break, wear a pedometer and set target steps for each day.

, Getting the proper amount of water every day is essential to have the optimal BMR and calorie burning potential. Although the daily recommended amount is six to eight 8-oz (237 ml) glasses of water a day, increasing that amount of water to ten to twelve glasses water may help boost your metabolism.It can also help you lose weight because water helps curb hunger.

, In addition to your daily water, drink green tea every day. Studies have shown that the catechins in green tea are thermogenic, which means they help burn calories.


Drink four to six cups or glasses of green tea, which can be hot or iced, daily.This can be used as a base in your morning smoothie or as a snack.
Avoid drinking it late at night unless you buy decaffeinated tea so you won't disrupt your sleeping patterns.

, If you are unsure of exactly how to integrate the needed foods, supplements, or changes into your daily life, think about asking a health professional, such as dietitian, for help. They can help you kickstart your metabolism in a safe, healthy, and effective way.


If you aren’t sure how to find a dietitian, ask your doctor for a recommendation.

, There are certain supplements that you can add to your daily routine in addition to your diet to help kickstart your metabolism. This does not mean they should take the place of adequate nutrients in your diet. Make sure you avoid supplements that claim to be for boosting your metabolism that are instead full of caffeine and ephedra derivatives. Always follow manufacturer’s instructions as well as those of your doctor. Helpful supplements include:


Turmeric and ginger, which is thermogenic, meaning it increases heat in the body to boost metabolism. Turmeric also contains antioxidants, which help eliminate harmful by products from the digestive process.B-complex vitamins, such as B6 and B12, which are essential for energy production to increase metabolismZinc and selenium, which are minerals required in many of the biochemical reactions that help with your metabolism. In addition to the supplement, zinc is found in scallops, oysters, dark poultry meat, and beef. Selenium is found in barley, mushrooms, Brazil nuts, and sunflower seeds.
Chili peppers contain capsaicin, a chemical compound that can boost metabolism.

, It is a common misconception that people will gain weight due to a slow metabolism. Although this does sometimes happen, weight gain is more than likely due to an abundance of bad calories that cannot be used by your metabolism to drive energy and charge your body.


In order to avoid this, eat proteins, whole foods, and good fats to provide your body with sufficient nutrients that will help your burn the ingested calories more efficiently., There is no strict guide to determine your exact BMR. It will vary depending on your body size and composition, which is measured through your weight and muscle mass. Your age and gender also play a major role in BMR levels.


Your BMR uses about 70% of the calories you ingest on a daily basis and this portion of your metabolic rate cannot change; however, the remaining 30% of your metabolic rate can change. Diet is one way, and increasing your physical activity and building up more muscle mass also help burn calories and increase your metabolic rate., The thyroid is a gland that plays a major role in metabolism. If you have an underactive thyroid condition, called hypothyroidism, you will have a low functioning metabolism. If you are worried about your metabolic rate or have the symptoms of hypothyroidism, consider having your doctor check your thyroid. These symptoms include:Unexplained weight gain
Fatigue
Lack of energy
Increase sensitivity to cold
Hair loss
Dry skin
Muscle weakness or aches
Abnormally heavy periods
Constipation
Depression

, Before you start any diet change, consult your doctor. You want to let them know what you are planning so they can let you know if you are making healthy choices. They may want to run tests for any conditions that might deter you from or limit how quickly you can go through the kickstart process.


Also let them know that you plan to change your diet. Make sure any new food items will not interact with any existing conditions you have.
Your doctor can also refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you plan meals and choose the best foods for your metabolism.

This can occur anywhere from three to 14 days after coming in contact with a cat.Visit a doctor if you believe that you have cat scratch fever.;
, You may notice the growth of small blisters or lesions around the site of the wound. These open sores or pus filled pimples are also indicative of an infection and will appear less than two weeks after contamination.Do not pop or burst the pustules. This may cause the spread of the infection.

, One to three weeks after exposure to B. henselae, your lymph nodes closest the infection site will be swollen and painful. These will be most common around the head, neck, and upper limbs.Look for small round bumps near the bite or scratch.

, If you are experiencing a cat scratch disease, you may become more tired than normal. You will generally feel tired, even after a restful night of sleep, and become fatigued more quickly while doing tasks.Avoid over-exertion if you experience fatigue and be sure to get plenty of rest.

, Cat scratch disease can cause you to suffer from a headache, which will appear a few days after exposure. Use the recommended dosage of acetaminophen or other pain relievers to deal with headaches.

, A mild fever may also develop as a result of the infection. Your temperature will run somewhere between 99 and 101 degrees. Fever is a relatively common symptom of cat scratch disease, but not considered severe.Use pain relievers or fever reduces to manage the fever.
Visit a doctor if your fever worsens.

, A very small number of those infected with cat scratch disease develop joint and muscle pain. Those reporting muscle and joint soreness tended to be under the age of 20. If untreated, this can result in chronic tendinitis, as well as persistent muscle and joint pain.Contact your doctor if you experience and joint or muscle soreness associated cat scratch disease.

, In rare instances, cat scratch disease has been known to cause decreased vision and a limited visual field.Contact your doctor if you experience any difficultly seeing or changes in your vision.
This tends to clear up with a dose of antibiotics.

, In people with compromised immune systems, B. henselae can cause bacillary angiomatosis, a disease characterized by lesions on the skin. This can present as sores in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, or other organs. Lesions are particularly dangerous for people with compromised immune systems because they can increase the likelihood of infection.This complication is most common among people with advanced HIV infection.

, You can develop encephalopathy (brain damage or malfunction), radiculopathy (local nerve injury), or ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) from cat scratch disease. Patients with and encephalopathy usually have confusion and disorientation. You may also have seizures or other neurological problems.Most symptoms typically resolve after treatment, but some people are left with residual neurological defects from cat scratch fever.

, B. henselae can cause a bacillary peliosis, which is a vascular infection of the spleen or liver. If you have bacillary peliosis, you would have small blood in your urine, which might cause a darker discoloration. If untreated, this infection can result in a significant deterioration in health among those with compromised immune systems.This complication is found almost exclusively among people with advanced HIV infection.

, If you are bitten or scratched by a cat, wash the wound with hot water and soap right away. This will wash away or kill any bacteria that may cause and infection.You may also want to disinfect it and apply a bandage to further clean the wound and prevent and further infection.

, If you work with young children or people who have compromised immune systems, be sure to wash your hands after handling any cats. You may get B. henselae on your hands and transmit it to others through touch, especially if they have an open wound.Always wear gloves when working around people with open wounds or infectious diseases.

, Because young cats are more likely to carry the disease, people with compromised immune systems should get cats older than one. This will minimize the likelihood of an infection.Your local shelter or pet store should be able to help you find a cat that will work best for you.

, Rough housing with your cat increases the likelihood that they will bite or scratch you. Your cat may not know that you are playing and get agitated., Because B. henselae is transmitted from fleas to cats to humans, you can constrain the spread of cat scratch disease by limiting your cat’s exposure to fleas. Apply a flea product to your cat and check its fur for fleas regularly. Also, keep your home flea free by vacuuming regularly and contacting pest control if you notice any fleas.Some over the counter flea guards can be harmful to your cat.

Avoid further contamination.,
Use conventional medications.,
Try homeopathic treatments.,
Consult a doctor about surgery in extreme cases.",How to Get Rid of Foot Fungus2," This infection can be brought on by athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) or through other forms of contamination such as exposure in public places. The fungus also thrives in warm, moist environments and may enter your body through cuts or openings between the nail and skin.Don’t share shoes, socks, or towels with anyone.
Avoid walking barefoot in locker rooms, public swimming pools, communal showers, or gyms.
Discard old shoes that may still be infected with the fungus.
Wash your hands with soap after touching the infected toenail(s) to keep it from spreading to uninfected nails.
Keep your infected foot dry by wearing open-toed shoes or wearing dry, clean socks.

, This infection can begin mildly, but spread into a more uncomfortable condition. The fungus may cause your nail to change color, disintegrate at the edge, or become abnormally thick. If it becomes bothersome, the condition should be treated. Try a prescription medicated antifungal cream that’s rubbed into the nail after it’s soaked in warm water.
Ask your doctor for prescription oral medication that should be taken from six to 12 weeks, in combination with topical antifungal treatments. It may be necessary for your doctor to monitor your liver function while you are on these medications

, A few non-conventional treatments have been effective in treating nail fungus in some people.


Use tea tree oil, applied in a light coating to the affected nail(s) two to three times a day—use products that are 100% tea tree oil.
Apply snakeroot extract, a treatment that has often proven as effective as conventional antifungal cremes. Soak your infected nail(s) in white vinegar, which has natural antibacterial properties. After filing the nail (exposing a fresh surface), apply full-strength vinegar with a cloth, cotton ball, or cotton swab 1–2 times daily for several weeks. , This may be necessary if the infected nail becomes extremely painful. The procedure involves removing the infected nail completely. The removal is often done in combination with treatment using antifungal medication in the nailbed. Rest assured that a new nail will grow back, but it may take up to one year.

Get sufficient exercise.",How to Get Rid of Foot Fungus3," Fungus thrives in moist, poorly ventilated areas, so wear light, breathable shoes and alternate them often. Discard old shoes that might harbor fungi.
Change your socks twice a day if your feet are prone to sweating.
Wear natural fabrics like cotton or wool and, unless they’re synthetics specifically designed to wick moisture away from the wearer.
Expose your feet to sunlight and fresh air when possible.

, Wash your feet with antibacterial soap and dry them thoroughly, especially between your toes.


Use clean towels each time you wash to avoid reinfection from dirty towels.
Apply antifungal foot powder between the toes and around the foot.
Trim nails short and keep them clean, especially in cases of toenail fungus.

, A weakened immune system puts you at a greater risk for developing Athlete’s foot and toenail fungus. Get enough sleep every night.

Eat a balanced diet with many fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
Take a multivitamin supplement each day or several times per week.
Spend time outdoors, particularly in the sun to get your needed dose of vitamin D.

Manage stress and anxiety through exercise, meditation, or other forms of relaxation.

, We all know that exercise is good for our health, but it is especially important to fight off infection and prevent its reoccurrence. Because your feet have diminished blood circulation compared to other parts of your body, it’s harder for your immune system to detect and eliminate foot infections.


Start slowly if you aren’t used to regular exercise—walking, swimming, or light calisthenics will get the circulation flowing.
Try light weight training at home or in a gym.
Take the stairs more often and park farther away from your destination—even a little bit of extra movement can help.

Buy the right oils.,
Make a salve.,
Repeat.",How to Get Rid of Foot Fungus at Home2," There are a number of herbs that have potent antifungal properties. A great way to apply these is through herb-infused essential oils. Make sure you buy 100% pure essential oils to ensure that you are getting a quality product. There are many different kinds of oils that have antifungal qualities, so you can pick which one you like the best. These include:Tea tree oil
Black walnut oil
Neem oil
Myrrh oil

, After you pick the essential oil you like best, mix equal amounts of the essential oil with either olive oil, grapeseed oil, or aloe vera gel. The oils and the aloe vera gel have additional antifungal properties to help with the fungus. Then, massage the mixture onto the affected foot area or toenails. After you apply it, put on cotton socks and wash your hands very well. Repeat this application twice a day.


You can also use an essential oil infused foot soak. Add four to five drops of essential oils to two quarts of water. Let your feet soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat twice a day., Essential oils, like other medicines, are not going to work overnight. Fungal infections of the nails require you to use the essential oil salve for about six months. The nails grow slowly, which means you have to treat it until all of the affected nail is gone to ensure the infection does not return.


You will know it is working when a clear and normal looking nail begins to show at the base of the nail.

Try to wear shoes that are made of breathable fabric. You can also try wearing 100% cotton socks. Other materials don’t allow your feet to breathe.


Also try buying more open toed shoes. This helps give your feet room to move around and give them access to open air., Avoid wearing the same shoes two days in a row. Your shoes need time to air out. Throw away worn out shoes that might be breeding grounds for bacteria and fungus. Also throw away or disinfect any shoes you wore without socks while you had foot fungus. You don't want to contract the fungus again.


You can also spray them with Lysol or other disinfectants to reduce the chance of fungus or bacteria growing in your shoes.
If your shoes aren't breathable, try to take your shoes off as often as you can and expose your feet to the air., In order to help your fungus not get worse, keep your feet dry. When you get out of the shower, use a cotton towel to dry your feet carefully. This is especially true if you are in a locker room or public shower. If you have already showered but your feet get wet, wash them separately to ensure they stay clean and dry.


Don't forget about the areas between toes. Keeping these dry will help with athlete's foot.
Avoid walking barefoot in public areas. Instead, wear flip-flops, sandals, or water shoes.

Know the risks.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Use medication.,
Seek medical help.",How to Get Rid of Foot Fungus at Home4," Foot fungus is caused by a fungal infection. This infection is common in people whose feet are often damp, warm, and sweaty or in people who wear tight fitting or confining shoes. This kind of fungal infection is also spread in public gyms, pools, and showers and can be caught anywhere people walk barefoot. , The symptoms of athlete’s foot start between your toes. In this area, a red rash starts to arise. This can spread to cover your entire foot, is often very itchy, and causes dry, scaly skin. It also causes burning sensations on your feet.


Athlete’s foot can spread to your hands, especially if you scratch the rash.Toenail fungus, another side of foot fungus, causes yellowish or brownish nails that thicken and crumble easily. As time goes on, the nail may separate from the nail bed and come completely off. Toenail fungus is usually not painful, but it can be., Athlete’s foot can be treated using over-the-counter antifungal products. These come as ointments, lotions, powder, or sprays. Pick which one you think is best for you. Fungal nail infections can be treated by taking over-the-counter antifungal drugs, using an antifungal medication in the form of nail polish, or applying medicated creams.


If the infection is more severe, you may need to see your doctor for a prescription for an antifungal medicine to apply to your feet. In severe or painful cases of toenail fungus, the toenail may be surgically removed in order for a healthy, new nail to slowly grow in its place., If your nail fungus or athlete's foot lasts for more than a few weeks after you start home treatments, see your doctor. There may be something else going on or the infection may be more severe. If your feet are cracked and bleeding, call your doctor. You should also seek assistance if you notice excessive swelling, itching, fever, or drainage due to athlete's foot.


If you have diabetes, see a doctor immediately if you even suspect you are getting either kind of foot fungus. It can be more severe or cause complications if you have diabetes."

Recognize the signs and symptoms of the infection.,
Know how the disease is treated.,
Understand that the illness can be fatal if not treated promptly and with the proper medicines.",How to Recognize and Treat Rabbit Fever (Tularemia)," The symptoms and their severity depend on how the person was exposed to the bacteria.


If exposure is through inhaling the virus, symptoms will appear abruptly and will include:

Fever.
Chills.
Nonproductive cough (dry with no mucus expelled).
Progressive weakness.

Headache.
Joint pain.
Muscle aches.


If exposure is by means of a bite from an infected insect, through handling a living or dead animal with the illness, or consuming contaminated food or water, symptoms may include:
Skin lesions.
Swollen and painful lymph glands.
Congested, bloodshot, and irritated eyes.

Sore throat.
Sores in the mouth.
Diarrhea.
Pneumonia.


Those who develop pneumonia from the bacterium can suffer:
Severe chest pains.
Difficulty in breathing.
Bloody saliva.

Seek medical attention at the onset of symptoms.",How to Survive a Bird Flu Pandemic," The flu vaccine that is currently used for seasonal flu will not work against avian influenza. New strains of the virus require new vaccines, and these can take months or years to develop and even longer to produce and distribute on a large scale.;
, Should a pandemic of any kind flare up, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other governmental and non-governmental organizations will provide information on the spread of the disease, as well as updates on vaccines or other medications, tips for keeping yourself safe, and travel advisories. The WHO and CDC, as well as various national governments, already have websites in place to provide useful planning information to the public. Newspapers and TV and radio broadcasts will also help disseminate critical warnings and advice.

, While the current vaccine won't protect you from Avian flu or any other ""new"" strains of the virus, it can help you stay healthy (by protecting you some flu virus strains), which may in turn help your body to fight the virus better if you do become infected.

, In past influenza pandemics, many victims succumbed to secondary pneumonia infection. While the pneumonia vaccine cannot protect against all types of pneumonia, it can improve your chances of surviving the pandemic. The vaccine is especially recommended for people over the age of 65 or those who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes or asthma.

, Two antiviral medications, Tamiflu and Relenza (Zanamivir), have shown the potential to effectively prevent and treat avian flu. These are both available only by prescription and will probably be effective only if taken before infection or very shortly afterward. It should be noted that additional testing is necessary to determine how effective these drugs really are against avian flu. Furthermore, mutations in the avian flu virus may render them ineffective in time.

, Handwashing may be the single most powerful defense against avian influenza and many other infectious diseases. If pandemic strikes, you should wash your hands several times a day. Make sure that you use proper Use an alcohol-based disinfectant. Since it's probably not feasible to wash your hands every time you touch something that may carry the virus, you should carry an alcohol-based hand cleaner with you at all times. These cleaners come in a variety of forms, and can be used any time you need a quick touch-up. Keep in mind, however, that the use of these cleaners is not a substitute for thoroughly washing your hands, and they should only be used to supplement hand washing.

, Right now, the only documented way to become infected with avian influenza is by coming into contact with infected birds or poultry products, and these routes of infection will continue even if the virus mutates so that human-to-human transmission becomes the greatest threat. Avoid handling wild birds, and try to prevent domestic animals (such as house cats) from coming into contact with birds. If you work in proximity to dead or live poultry--on a farm or in a poultry-processing facility, for example--take precautions such as wearing gloves, respirators, and safety aprons. Cook poultry thoroughly, to 165 °F (74 °C) throughout, and exercise proper food-handling techniques, as you would to protect yourself from other threats such as salmonella. Proper cooking kills the avian influenza virus.

, The most effective way to prevent becoming infected with avian influenza is to avoid exposure to infected people. Unfortunately, it's not possible to determine who is infected and who is not--by the time symptoms appear, a person is already contagious. Social distancing, deliberately limiting contact with people (especially large groups of people), is a reasonable precaution to take in the event of a pandemic.


Stay home from work. If you're sick or if others at your workplace have become sick, you should stay away from your workplace even in the absence of a pandemic. Given that people will generally be infected and contagious before they exhibit symptoms, however, during a pandemic it's essential to stay away from places, such as work, where you have a high probability of being exposed to an infected person.
Try to work from home. A pandemic can last for months or even years, and waves of intense local outbreaks can last for weeks, so it's not like you can just take a few sick days to protect yourself from workplace infection. If possible, try to arrange a work-from-home situation. A surprising variety of jobs can now be accomplished remotely, and employers will likely be willing--or even required--to try this out if a pandemic strikes.
Keep children home from school. Any parent knows that kids pick up all kinds of bugs at school. Avian influenza is one bug that you certainly don't want your kids picking up.
Avoid public transportation. Buses, planes, boats, and trains place large numbers of people in close quarters. Public transportation is the ideal vehicle for widespread spread of infectious disease.
Stay away from public events. During a pandemic, governments may cancel public events, but even if they don't, you should probably stay away from them. Any large gathering of people in close proximity creates a high-risk situation.

, The influenza virus can be spread through the air, so in the event of a pandemic it's a good idea to protect yourself from inhalation of the virus if you're out in public. While surgical masks only prevent the wearer from spreading germs, respirators (which often look like surgical masks) protect the wearer from inhaling germs. You can buy respirators that are designed for one-time use, or you can buy reusable ones with replaceable filters. Use only respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and labeled as ""NIOSH certified"", ""N95"", ""N99"", or ""N100"", as these help protect against inhalation of very small particles. Respirators only provide protection when worn properly, so be sure to follow the instructions exactly--they should cover the nose, and there should be no gaps between the mask and the side of the face.

, Gloves can prevent germs from getting on your hands, where they can be absorbed directly through open cuts or spread to other parts of your body. Latex or nitrile medical gloves or heavy-duty rubber gloves can be used to protect the hands. The gloves should be removed if torn or damaged, and hands should be thoroughly washed after removal of gloves.

, Avian influenza can be spread if contaminated droplets (from a sneeze, for example) enter the eyes. Wear glasses or goggles to prevent this from occurring, and avoid touching your eyes with your hands or with potentially contaminated materials.

, Gloves, masks, tissues, and other potential biohazards should be handled carefully and disposed of properly. Place these materials in approved biohazard containers or seal them in clearly marked plastic bags.

, If a pandemic strikes, many of the basic services we take for granted, such as electricity, phone, and mass transit, may be disrupted temporarily. Widespread employee absenteeism and massive death tolls can shut down everything from the corner store to hospitals.


Keep a small amount of cash around at all times as banks may close and ATMs may be out of service.
Discuss emergency preparation with your family. Make a plan so that children will know what to do and where to go if you are incapacitated or killed, or if family members cannot communicate with each other.
Stock up on necessities. In the developed world, at least, food shortages and disruption of services will likely not last more than a week or two at a time. Still, it's essential to be prepared for such an event.

Store a two-week supply of water for everyone in your household. Keep at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) per person per day in clear plastic containers.
Store a two-week supply of food. Opt for non-perishable foods that don't need to be cooked and that don't require a lot of water to prepare.
Make sure you have an adequate supply of essential medications.



, The effectiveness of antiviral medications decreases as the illness progresses, so prompt medical treatment is imperative. If someone with whom you have had close contact becomes infected, be sure to seek medical care even if you do not display symptoms."

Fructose
Crystalline fructose
Honey

, To cause ketosis in your body, you need to eat – on average – fewer than 25 grams of carbohydrates daily. This is a very low number and will take some effort. Keep a diet journal to keep track of your carb intake, or use an app for this purpose. Read the labels on your food products, and take serving size into account.

If a serving size is 1 ounce and contains 10 grams of carbohydrates but you’re eating 2 ounces, that equals 20 grams of carbs.
Eat at least 20 grams of carbs daily. Your body needs this much to function properly.

, The most effective ketogenic diet provides calories mainly from fat, very little from carbohydrates, and an appropriate amount of protein. The general rule is to obtain 75% of your daily calories from fat, 20% from protein, and 5% from carbs.Use your diet journal to keep track of the math.

There’s some leeway in these numbers, and since everyone is different you should see what feels best for you: get 5-10% from carbs, 20-25% from protein, and 70-75% from fat.
For example, a meal could be beef stew with roasted butternut squash, teriyaki turkey and lettuce wraps, or a hamburger without the bun and a side of broccoli., It can take up to 3 months for your body to adapt to burning fat completely, though you may start seeing subtle changes from the diet in 6-8 weeks. For best weight-loss effects, stick to your ketogenic diet for the long-term., Inducing ketosis isn’t right for everyone, and for people with certain medical conditions it can cause serious health consequences. Talk to your doctor before starting any drastic diet. They will discuss your health history and possibly do a physical exam. Tell them what your goals are and discuss alternate diets.It’s especially important to talk to a healthcare professional before dieting if you have diabetes, severe kidney disease, or you take a diuretic medication.
Say something to your doctor such as, “I want to use ketosis to lose weight. Is this a safe option for me?”

, This is regarded as a high-fat diet, which may not be appropriate for people with some medical conditions. Talk to your doctor or a dietician first if you have heart disease, high cholesterol, atherosclerosis, or you ever had a heart attack. This diet may be helpful for you, but consult a healthcare professional first to make sure you won’t be putting yourself at risk., If too many ketones build up in your body, it can cause ketoacidosis – a state that basically poisons your body. This can happen quickly, even within 24 hours. It’s a medical emergency and can lead to coma or death. Seek medical care immediately if you are dieting to increase ketosis and experience any of the following:Abdominal pain
Difficulty concentrating or confusion
Dry mouth and feeling very thirsty
Flushed skin or dry skin
Urinating much more than usual
Nausea and vomiting
Feeling short of breath or breathing rapidly
A fruity smell to your breath

Companies claim trehalose has half the sweetness of sucrose.Trehalose is used in baked goods, drinks, desserts, jams, cereals, and noodles., Much research has been conducted on trehalose recently. Some potentially important research indicates that trehalose can induce certain processes in cells by blocking a cellular transporter for glucose. This may be particularly useful in treating a condition known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disorder that can result in liver failure or liver cancer. One of the effects of trehalose was to decrease the amount of fats in the liver.Other research indicates that trehalose may be useful in breaking up clumps of proteins that are seen in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)., Trehalose appears to be safe for human consumption in doses up to 50 grams a day. No side effects have been reported.A small portion of people lack the enzyme that metabolizes trehalose. About 10 to 15% of Inuits lack the enzyme.
It has been used in Japan as a supplement for decades with no reported significant adverse effects.

, There are some people who report intolerance to trehalose. If an individual exhibits intolerance, they should stop taking supplements or limit foods containing trehalose. The symptoms are intolerance are minor, and include:Gas

Relax.,
Get enough sleep.,
Lower your body fat percentages.,
Do interval training.,
Monitor your progress.",How to Increase HGH1," Read a good book, take a long bath, or go on a walk. Meditate and practice breathing techniques. Watch a funny movie or go to a comedy club. Surround yourself with funny people and laugh often. Chronic or continual stress reduces the presence of HGH in the body.The very process of laughing has a positive effect on the body and increases HGH. People watching a funny movie can even anticipate a rise of up to 87% in their HGH.One way of gauging stress could be to take your blood pressure on a daily basis. If you invest in a blood pressure cuff, then you can take a baseline reading and go from there. If you reach a consistent blood pressure of 120/80, then you are likely succeeding in relaxing and your HGH may boost as a result.;
, Your level of HGH is directly connected to your ability to get to REM, or deep sleep. Try to get at least 8 hours of undisturbed sleep per night. Create a relaxing routine in the evening, such as reading a book. Avoid playing with electronics which can expose you to blue light and lessen the quality of sleep.You can also reduce your caffeine intake, which might help you to fall asleep faster and deeper.
As you sleep, your body releases intervals of GH (growth hormone). If you miss hours of sleep, then you miss GH bursts., Gaining muscle and losing fat can positively impact your HGH levels. Body fat inhibits the production of HGH and belly fat is especially problematic. Try to lose the weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and working out at least three times a week. Resistance exercises can be particularly helpful at trimming your mid-section.The presence of extra abdominal fat can lower your HGH by almost half the average amount.
To gauge your percentage of body fat, you can visit a personal trainer or invest in a body fat caliper. Talk with your doctor about how to accurately measure using the caliper.

, Create a work-out plan where you go through 30 second busts of intense activity followed by brief rest periods. You can include both challenging cardio and weight routines as part of your interval work-out. Breaking a sweat can be a sign of a particularly effective interval routine.Interval work-outs elevate HGH because the pituitary gland boosts production to assist with muscle recovery.

, Make an appointment with your doctor to take your HGH readings at the start of this process and at monthly or bi-monthly intervals thereafter. This will help you to know whether or not you are making appropriate progress. You can also pay close attention to your body to see if you have extra energy or if you are putting on muscle easier as these are indicators of HGH increases.

People or babies who are incontinent or unable to hold their urine (this creates a moist genital environment)
People who perspire heavily
Individuals who work or spend time in an environment where they come in contact with people who are at high risk, such as nurses, school teachers, hospitalized patients, students and coaches.;
, Parts of your skin that are moist are more at risk for fungal infections since the fungus needs moisture to thrive.These parts include the areas between your toes, under the breast tissue, in the genital region (including the vaginal area), and between folds of skin.

, Since fungal infections are contagious, you can get them from exposure to skin cells that have the infection. Try to reduce your exposure to public areas where other people with fungal infections may have been. If you use public locker rooms, showers, or pools, wear flip flops. You shouldn't ever share towels or combs in the locker room either.Never touch other people's infections or share shoes.

, Fungi live in warm, moist areas, like between the toes or in the groin. By keeping your skin clean and dry you reduce the potential for infection. There are several things you can do to keep dry.


Change your socks once daily or twice daily if you sweat a lot. Let your bath towels air dry completely before using them a second time.Clean and dry any skinfold areas such as under the breast or under the stomach. Apply a drying or medicated powder to the skin folds when you are exercising or are going to be in a hot environment.
You should also alternate your shoes so they can dry completely between wearings, especially if they get sweaty. Also, wash your athletic supporter after each use.

, You're more likely to get a fungal infection if you have a depressed immune system. To improve your immune system, take a daily vitamin supplementand consider taking a probiotic.Try to eat a balanced diet high in healthy fats and reduce your carbohydrate intake. You should also stay hydrated by drinking water. Your urine should be very light yellow in color.Your immune system may also benefit from 8 hours of sleep a night.Your immune system may not be in the best shape, even if you don't have a medical condition or are taking medications that might depress it. This makes it important to strengthen your immune system.

, If you already have a fungal infection, prevent it from spreading to more parts of your body or to your family members. Other family members should be examined and treated, if infection is suspected. Since fungal infections are contagious, take the following precautions to prevent spreading the infection:Avoid scratching your infection. Wash your hands frequently and keep them dry.
Use flip flops in the shower if you have athlete’s foot.
Wash all towels in warm, soapy water and dry in the dryer. Use a clean towel every time your shower or clean up.
Clean your bathroom sink, tub, and floor well after using.
Wear clean, dry clothes every day and avoid sharing clothes or socks.
Treat all infected pets.
Children and adults may want to use medicated shampoo 2 to 3 times a week for 6 weeks to prevent tinea capitis (itching/ringworm of the scalp).
Soak combs and brushes for 1 hour a day in a mixture of half bleach and half water for 3 days if you have tinea capitis. Don't share combs, brushes, hats, pillows, helmets, or towels with other people.

, Although it goes by several different names depending upon the location on the body, all are caused by the same fungus (not a parasitic worm, despite the name). If you have athlete’s foot, jock itch or ringworm the fungus is the same, the location is different. The symptoms may be slightly different depending on the location of the fungal infection., Athlete's foot, also called tinea pedis, causes red or itchy skin around and between the toes, and less often on the soles of the feet. You may experience burning or stinging pain and the skin will blister and crust.You may also find red, scaly bumps between your toes., Jock Itch, also called tinea cruris, is common mostly in teen boys and adult men. Symptoms include red, raised scaly patches with defined borders that blister in the groin. They are redder on the outside and more flesh colored on the inside, giving them a classic ring appearance of ringworm. They can also cause abnormally dark or light pigmentation on the skin which can be permanent.This infection is more common in boys who play athletics and spend time in a public locker room.They may also have athlete’s foot from the same fungus with which they reinfect themselves in the groin.

, Tinea corporis is a ringworm infection which appears on the body, but not the scalp, inside a beard, on the feet or in the groin area. It begins as a small raised red area that looks like small pimples. It is itchy and quickly becomes scaly. The rash will slowly take on a ring shape classic to ringworm with a redder exterior border and a flesh colored middle.You should also look for dermatophytids (a rash). This rash affects another part of your body and can accompany body ringworm. You may experience an itchy bumpy rash on your fingers which is related to an allergic reaction to the fungus. This does not result from touching an infected area., Tinea barbae is ringworm found in a man’s facial hair. It can cause a deeper infection in the follicles of a man’s beard and may result in permanent hair loss from scarring with follicular infection. Symptoms include a reddened area on the skin that is itchy and can become scaly. Depending upon the location you can see the classic ring characteristic with redder border and more flesh colored interior. The man will also lose hair growth with an active fungal infection.You should also look for dermatophytids (a rash). This rash affects another part of your body and can accompany facial ringworm. You may experience an itchy bumpy rash on your fingers which is related to an allergic reaction to the fungus. This does not result from touching an infected area., Tinea capitis is ringworm found on the scalp and may involve a small portion or the whole head. Areas that are infected will be itchy and red, often inflamed and can have pus filled sores. It also may cause a lot of scaling of the scalp, either in one area, or of a large part of the scalp. You can also look for 'black dots', which are the broken hairs that occur with scalp ringworm. Individuals with tinea capitis will lose their hair during an active infection and the infection can cause lasting scar tissue and permanent hair loss if not treated properly. Individuals may also experience a low grade fever below 101 degrees Fahrenheit or swollen lymph nodes in the neck area as your body is fighting the infection.You should also look for dermatophytids (a rash). This rash affects another part of your body and can accompany tinea capitis, or ringworm on your scalp. You may experience an itchy bumpy rash on your fingers which is related to an allergic reaction to the fungus. This does not result from touching an infected area., Yeast are actually fungus and can cause vaginal infections for women. The vagina, labia, and vulva can all be affected by a yeast infection. You shouldn't try to treat symptoms at home if you've had more than 4 infections in the last year, are pregnant, have uncontrolled diabetes, have a depressed immune system, or have tears, cracks, fissures, or sores in the vaginal area. Most yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate and include:Itching and irritation in the vagina or at the entrance to the vagina
Redness or swelling at the entrance to the vagina
Vaginal pain and soreness
Burning sensation with urination or intercourse
Vaginal discharge that has a cottage cheese appearance and is white, thick and odorless

, Over-the-counter antifungal powders or creams are effective in controlling or eliminating the infection. Look for products that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, terbinafine, or tolnaftate. Follow the packaged instructions and apply the medication for at least 2 weeks and an additional 1-2 weeks after the infection is cleared to prevent it from returning.Wash your feet twice a day with soap and water. Be sure to dry your feet and between the toes, then put on a clean pair of socks after each washing.


Wear shoes that are well ventilated and made of natural materials. You should also alternate your shoes everyday to give them time to dry out thoroughly.
If you have athlete's foot that isn't responding to home treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral medications after testing your infection by taking a culture.

, Use over-the-counter antifungal products to help control the infection. These medications should contain miconazole, tolnaftate, terbinafine or clotrimazole. You should notice the infection start to clear up within a few weeks. If it lasts longer than 2 weeks, is severe, or returns frequently (more than 4 times a year), you should see your doctor.If it doesn't respond to home treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral medications after testing your infection by taking a culture.


Avoid wearing tight clothing or anything that rubs or irritates the skin.
Wash all undergarments and athletic supporters after one use.

, Use over-the-counter creams that contain oxiconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole or terbinafine. Follow packaged instructions for 10 days. In general, you should wash and dry the area, then apply the cream from the outside to the center of the infection. Wash and dry your hands after applying the cream. Don't put a bandage over ringworm because it will keep the moisture in your skin.If you have ringworm on your scalp or beard you must see your doctor for treatments. If you have ringworm on the body that isn't responding to home treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral medications after testing your infection by taking a culture.
If you're treating school-aged children for ringworm, they can return to classes once treatment has started.

, Uncomplicated vaginal yeast infections can be treated with over-the-counter preparations. Use antifungal vaginal suppository creams, foams, tablets, or ointments from a class of azoles. These include butoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, and terconazole. You may notice some slight burning or irritation to the area when you apply the medication. Always follow the packaged instructions.The oil-based nature of these creams can weaken a latex condom or diaphragm. If these are your forms of birth control, realize that they may not be as effective while using the medication.

, You may need long-course vaginal therapy that includes using a prescription vaginal cream in the “azole” family which is stronger than what can be purchased over-the-counter. You'll use the cream for 10 to 14 days. If you have complications from vaginal yeast infections, your doctor may prescribe fluconazole (Diflucan) to be taken 1 time by mouth.Or, you may be given 2 to 3 doses of fluconazole by mouth, instead of a cream. This is not recommended for pregnant women.


If you have repeated infections, you may take a maintenance dose of fluconazole once a week for 6 months or a vaginal suppository of clotrimazole.

, Your doctor will need to help you treat fungal infections because diabetes or a depressed immune system can increase your risk of experiencing more severe symptoms from a fungal infection.


See your doctor for early treatment to reduce potential health problems or significant secondary infections from scratching.

, Your doctor will give you an oral medication that will include griseofulvin, terbinafine or itraconazole. Take the medication according to your doctor's instructions, usually for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 8 weeks. You can improve your chance for successful treatment by:Keeping the area clean and dry
Washing the hair and beard with medicated shampoo that contains selenium sulfide or ketoconazole. This will help stop the spread but will not get rid of the current infection.

Meet with a doctor.,
Get injections.,
Take hormonal supplements.,
Beware of scams.",How to Increase HGH2," Make an appointment with your general practitioner or an endocrinologist. They will likely run a series of blood tests to determine if you are GH deficient. Sometimes low GH levels can be connected with other conditions as well, such as Turner Syndrome. Your doctor can also discuss possible safe treatment and care options with you., GH injections are available by prescription if you are diagnosed by a doctor. They are given via a pen-like device and are relatively pain free. The injections are usually given around bedtime and are usually successful at boosting the production of GH overnight. Injections may be combined with oral supplements as part of a larger GH therapy program.Be aware that GH injections provided outside of a doctor’s prescription are illegal and highly dangerous., You can also take supplements as part of a broader hormonal therapy program. You will want to discuss this with your doctor and they can either write you a prescription or direct you toward certain brands. Some amino acid supplements, such as arginine, come in an oral form. You may need to take a higher dose in order to see results, so make sure to consult with a doctor for safety.For example, a sample dosage of arginine could be between five to nine grams after each work-out session., There is no one pill that is an immediate HGH cure-all. The same goes for any creams advertised as an instant GH boost. Creams are considered only minimally effective at boosting GH. When in doubt, talk with your doctor about any treatments and verify that they are medically sound before proceeding."

Keep your insulin levels low.,
Get your vitamin D. You can get your vitamin D by eating certain foods, such as salmon, by spending time in the sun or through a vitamin pill.,
Eat amino acids.,
Eat a protein post-work out.,
Monitor your late night meals.,
Try intermittent fasting.",How to Increase HGH3," High insulin levels prevent your body from releasing GH. Eat foods that rank low on the glycemic index, such as complex carbohydrates. Avoid foods that are composed of simple sugars, such as most cookies or cakes. Make a point to especially avoid any sugar-laden snacks immediately before and after a work-out.Lean proteins, such as skinless chicken or lean cuts of beef, help to balance out the absorption of glucose into the blood, keeping your insulin levels down. Fiber-rich foods, like broccoli or beans, are good options, too.
Also, be sure to avoid consuming any sugary snacks before you go to sleep., Talk with your doctor about which method, or combination, might work the best for you. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a lowered amount of numerous hormones, including GH.Some foods that are rich in vitamin D, include tuna and egg yolks. Many dairy products are also fortified with vitamin D, such as milk and yogurt., Look for foods that contain ample amounts of protein, such as dairy products and meats. Chicken, steak, cheese, and yogurt are all good amino options. When your amino acid levels are high, your body boosts the production of GH., Timing of your meals and snacks is particularly important. Get a GH boost by consuming a protein-rich snack within 30 minutes, before or after, or a work out. You can drink a yogurt shake or even eat a boiled egg. This protein will give your body the fuel to maximum muscle breakdown and regeneration, prompting GH increases., Try not to eat at least one hour prior to going to bed, as this will allow your body to fully process your food. Or, if you simply cannot give up late night snacking, try to give your body additional fuel in the form of complex carbohydrates or proteins. Go for combination snacks, such as an egg and wheat bagel sandwich., This is a diet plan where you consume fewer calories (usually half of your normal amount) for two days out of each week. If you typically eat 1,500 calories each day, then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example, you would limit yourself to only 750 calories for those days. This diet change can help to burn off fat and keep insulin levels under control. However, this can be a controversial method, so make sure to get your doctor’s OK before proceeding."

Limit yourself to one cheat meal each week.,
Pick a time to cheat.,
Cheat with foods your diet generally restricts.,
Don’t go overboard.",How to Include Cheat Meals in Your Diet1," Aiming for one cheat meal per week can help you control your cravings and not feel like you are missing out on life’s pleasures. On a cheat day, make sure you eat healthy foods for the rest of your meals and snacks. For example, balance a cheat dinner with a healthy lunch and breakfast.You may be tempted to skip other meals in anticipation of eating more calories during your cheat meal, but it's important you stick to your regular, healthy eating habits. If you're having a cheat meal for dinner, don't skip breakfast or lunch. This can disrupt your metabolism and also cause you to overeat during the meal because you're starving.;
, It is important to have a clear plan about exactly when you will have a cheat meal. This helps you stay in control of your overall dieting strategy. You might, for example, decide to have a cheat meal on an upcoming social occasion. On the other hand, a weekend could be the best time for you to include a cheat meal., When you plan for a cheat meal, you should consider precisely what you will be eating. Think about satiating (in a moderate, controlled way) your craving for a specific food you've been missing. If you are avoiding carbohydrates in your diet, for example, digging into some bread and pasta might be a good choice. If you’re cutting back on sugar, having a slice of cake at a friend’s social gathering is a great way to cheat.

, Remember that a cheat meal is just that — a meal. You should avoid having an entire cheat day. Instead, focus on a single meal during which you will consume foods and/or drinks that you deny yourself while dieting. This will help you stay focused while at the same time satisfying some cravings."

Do not take your pet to a vet without first calling the office and advising the staff that you suspect they may be dealing with a case of monkey pox.,
See your health care provider as soon as possible if you suspect you have come into contact with the monkey pox virus.

,
Understand that there is no test to determine if a live animal has monkey pox.",How to Prevent Monkeypox,"
Coming into contact with the body fluids of an infected animal.
Contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected animal (i.e., changing bedding material or holding the animal close to the face).;
, Therefore it should be presumed that any mammal, including common household pets, could get monkey pox if exposed to the disease.

, Symptoms include:


Fatigued and inattentive.
Reluctant to eat or drink.
Feverish.

Coughing.
A discharge from the eyes.
Swollen lymph nodes.

Try making a list of favorite foods and rotating through them during your weekly cheat meals., Try getting a workout in before you enjoy the cheat meal. Working out will help you burn more calories on the day you cheat. If you can’t work out before the meal, you should at least aim to work out later in the day., It’s important that you don’t overeat when you are having a cheat meal. Pay attention to portion sizes and try to stick to them. This will help you avoid consuming thousands of calories in a single sitting, which could be detrimental to your dieting success.Make sure you only cheat for one meal, not an entire day.

Lay down rat poison.,
Set rat traps.,
Buy some glue boards to trap the rats.,
Set a humane wire cage trap.,
Prevent rat infestations from occurring.",How to Prevent Rat Bite Fever1," You can purchase rat poison at most hardware and garden supply stores. Rat poison contains warfarin, which can kill rats. You should place the rat poison where the rats spend most of their time. However, you should not use rat poison if you have pets because it can make your pets very ill. Scroll down to the other steps in this article for more pet-friendly options. If you do not have pets and choose to use rat poison, place it:


In rat holes and other dark spots where you have found rat feces, or where you have seen rats entering and exiting. If you would prefer a more humane way of getting rid of rats, see Step 4.;
, A rat trap is a specialized device that snaps shut when a rat steps on it. You place a piece of bait on the center or end of the rat trap, and when the rat goes for the bait, a section of the trap snaps shut, killing the rat. Place the traps near where you have seen rat feces or where rats enter and exit your home.Once you have set the traps, check them everyday. If a rat is caught and killed, its body should be removed right away. If you are concerned about killing rats and would prefer a more humane way to trap them, see Step 4.

, A glue board is a piece of plastic or wood that has had one of its side covered in a very sticky glue. You can put a piece of bait in the middle of the board. When a rat goes to get the bait, it gets stuck on the glue and eventually dies. If you are looking for a more humane way to get rid of the rats, see the next step.

, This sort of trap is intended for people who do not wish to kill the rats, but would rather remove them from their property and put them out in the forest or other natural space. To set up this kind of trap, place it where you have seen rats in your house. Put bait in the closed end of the trap. When the rat steps into the trap to get the bait, the door will spring shut.


Check these traps every day. If you find a rat, take the rat far away from your house and release it in a natural area like a forest or swamp.

, If you are concerned that you may have more than one or two rats living in your house, or if you don’t have rats and really don’t want them to be attracted to your house, make your house as unpleasant for a rat as possible:


Dispose of your trash properly. Spoiled foods must be properly disposed and trash cans should be kept sealed at all times to avoid attracting rodents.
Keep your food sealed up. If a rat can’t access any of your food because the food is in sealed plastic containers, the rat is much less likely to make your house his home.
Block up any potential entrances that rats could enter your house through. Any holes in the doors, walls or screens of your house should be sealed up to keep rodents out.

Know if you are at risk.,
Wear a surgical mask to prevent bacteria inhalation.,
Consider the risk of other means of transmission.,
Limit access to facilities where infected animals are housed.,
Dispose of animal birth byproducts.,
Follow occupational safety practices.,
Minimize the likelihood of a Q fever outbreak.,
Count the weeks following possible infection.,
Pay attention to flu-like symptoms.,
Stay hydrated and rest.,
Visit the hospital in severe cases of Q fever.",How to Prevent Q Fever (Coxiella Burnetii Infection)," Coxiella burnetii is excreted in the milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Cows, sheep, and goats are the primary carriers, although other animals can carry the bacteria as well. The bacteria are also expelled in high numbers in the amniotic fluids and the placenta of birthing animals.People who regularly work around livestock, including farm workers, sheep and dairy workers, and veterinarians, are examples of professions that are high-risk for Q fever.Workers in meat-processing plants and researchers who are in facilities that house livestock are also at a higher risk.;
, This is an easy way to guard your air intake, and is especially important if you may be exposed to Coxiella burnetii as part of your occupation. Anytime you are outside, in a barn or building where animals are housed, or otherwise engaging with livestock, plan to wear a surgical (or other mouth-covering) mask.

, Although Coxiella burnetii is largely transmitted through contact with animals and their excreta, there are other means of transmission. Humans can contract Q fever through tick bites (if the tick is infected with Coxiella burnetii), through drinking infected unpasteurized milk, and through human-to-human contact.Avoid tick bites by thoroughly searching over your body (especially armpits and groin) after time spent around livestock. Since ticks often seek out large animals, you can further protect yourself by spraying yourself or your clothes with an insect repellant such as DEET.
All unpasteurized milk must be labeled as such by FDA regulation, so it’s easy to avoid.
The likelihood of contracting Q fever through tick bite, bad milk, or human contact is very small., It may be necessary to quarantine infected (or potentially infected) animals so that they do not pass the infection on to other animals or humans. Since the illness is so easily transmitted, it’s crucial to limit human contact with infected animals.


Quarantine all imported animals, until you can confirm that they are not infected., These items commonly infect humans with Q fever and should be sanitarily disposed of immediately following an animal’s birth. Dispose of the placenta, birth products, fetal membranes, and aborted fetuses in an appropriate manner.Always wear a face mask when dealing with animals giving birth. If Q fever is known or suspected in a herd or flock wear N95 or higher mask.
Wear rubber gloves and protective clothing when handling animal excreta.
Wash hands thoroughly and several times a day with disinfectant soap after any contact with animals. In particular, make sure you wash your hands after disposing of any animal bodily products.

, If you work in or manage people in an occupation that deals with livestock — including veterinarians, meat-processing technicians, sheep and dairy workers, livestock farmers, and sheep and livestock researchers — be sure to follow industry safety guidance to limit the transmission of Q fever.This may include wearing gloves and protective clothing.


Maintain strict and proper procedures for bagging, sterilizing, and washing of work clothing.
Insure that all personnel wear appropriate safety equipment.
Implement steps to prevent airflow from one animal housing area to other occupied areas (animal or human).
Educate employees about the infection and how it is spread. Those who have cardiac valvular disease should be made aware of the high risks involved.
Adhere to strict guidelines for sterilizing and dismantling or assembling meat-processing equipment.

, Keep animal and human populations separate as much as possible, and prevent Q fever with medicine as much as possible. Vaccinate all persons engaged in research with pregnant sheep or live Coxiella burnetii when possible. Based on where your facility is located, you may or may not be able to legally use the Coxiella burnetii vaccine.Locate all housing facilities for sheep away from areas populated by humans.
Routinely test animals for antibodies to the bacteria.
Wildlife or pets should not be able to scavenge birth products from the farm animals. These should be buried and composted or disposed of in a closed container.

, Most people become sick within two to three weeks after exposure.Q fever typically runs its course in one week, at which point the symptoms will decline and vanish.


The Q fever incubation period varies depending on the number of bacteria that infect the patient initially. Infection with larger numbers results in shorter incubation periods.
Those who fully recover sometimes acquire lifelong immunity against reinfection.

, Only about half of people infected with Coxiella burnetii bacteria contract Q fever. Individuals sick with Q fever often experience severe nausea and fever, with other pronounced flu-like symptoms.These can include:


Sweats and chills.
Severe headache
Chest pain (when breathing) and other muscle aches
Vomiting and diarrhea
Abdominal pain
General malaise

, Since many of the symptoms of Q fever involve fluid loss, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Individuals sick with Q fever should also avoid spending time outside, especially in sunny climates, and should rest as much as possible.


Vomiting and diarrhea puts a sick individual at high risk of dehydration.

, Although Q fever usually runs its course within two to three weeks. In some cases the sick individual may need to be hospitalized. Hospitalization is often necessary in cases where Q fever brings complications such as pneumonia, and inflammations of the heart and liver.In about 2% of cases, an individual can develop chronic Q fever. This is a serious condition that is diagnosed with the Q fever has lasted for longer than six months.Doxycycline, an antibiotic, is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever.If treatment is initiated within the first three days of the disease, the fever commonly subsides within 72 hours.

Do some research to find the best exterminators in your area.,
Compare the price ranges of two or three companies before settling on an exterminator.,
Explain the situation to the exterminator.,
Pick the right extermination process for your specific household.",How to Prevent Rat Bite Fever2," If you would prefer to have a professional handle your rat problem, hire a professional extermination service. Find extermination companies in your area by:


Running an internet search.
Using the yellow pages.
Asking friends for recommendations.

, Before you settle on a company, get into contact with several other companies. Compare the prices and services that each company offers, and settle on one that seems to be the best service for the best price.


Discuss the warranty of service with the exterminator that you pick. The exterminator should offer a deal that covers the reappearance of the rats. For example, if the exterminator comes to your house, but the rats come back within a couple of weeks, the exterminator should provide another service for free.

, While it might be embarrassing to discuss the extent of your rat problem, it is necessary to do so so that the exterminator can handle your problem in the best possible way. Talk to the exterminator about details like:


Where you have seen the rats or rat feces most frequently.
How often you see the rats.
If the rats are also in your yard, or if they stay pretty much exclusively in your house.
Any other details that the exterminator asks for.

, This is particularly important to do if you have pets or small children. Some extermination practices involve laying down rat poison, which can harm any pets that you have around the house. Because of this, you should talk to the exterminator about the different options that the company offers so that your pets and children can stay healthy, but you can also make your home rat-free.

Keep your food covered.,
Clean all your cans and tins.,
Avoid drinking unpasteurized milk.,
Wash your hands regularly and maintain good hygiene.,
Avoid bathing in or drinking contaminated water.,
Contact a vet if your pet rat is acting strangely or seems sick.",How to Prevent Rat Bite Fever3," Either store your food in locked containers or keep your food in the fridge. Make sure that the containers have a lid that seals well. Covering food with plastic sheets or tin foil isn’t a good idea because rats can easily bite through the paper or tin foil and infect your food.


Do not keep any food outside, like in your garage or in your backyard, because it will most likely attract rats.

, Most canned goods are stored in storage units that rats can get into. These rodents may urinate or defecate on the cans. While the food inside the cans is still safe, it is important to wash the cans before you open them so that the bacteria left behind by the rats gets washed away.


Wash the cans with warm water for two to three minutes before you open them.

, Unpasteurized milk can contain the bacteria that leads to rat bite fever. Because of this, you should try to purchase pasteurized milk that has been boiled to get rid of any bacteria. If you have buy unpasteurized milk, boil it before you drink it and do not drink it straight out of the carton.To boil the milk:


Pour the milk into a pot and bring it to a boil on the stove. Once it is at a boil and bubbles appear on the surface, let the milk continue to boil for another minute. Remove the pot and milk from the stove and let it cool down before you drink it.

, This is particularly important to do if you live in or are traveling through an area that is known to have rat bite fever. Always wash your hands before handling food, after handling food, and after you go to the bathroom. To properly wash your hands:


Wet your hands with soap and water. You can use hand sanitizer if there is no soap available. Create a lather and rub your hands together, palm to palm. Interlace your fingers and lather the insides of your fingers. Rub the back of one hand against the back of the other hand. Lather your hands should take about a minute.
Wash your hands off with water. Turn the faucet off with a paper towel so that you do not have to touch the faucet. Dry your hands with a paper towel.

, If you are in an area that has had rat bite fever problems in the past, it is important to practice safe water habits. When bathing, make sure to avoid getting water in your eyes, ears, mouth, or nose. If possible, decontaminate the water before using it to bathe. The same goes for drinking water—if you not positive that is safe to drink, you should decontaminate it. Ways to purify water include:


Boil the water for at least one minute.
Use chemicals to purify your water. Substances like chlorine and iodine can be dissolved in water to remove parasites. However, this is not 100% accurate all the time, so you should boil the water first and then add the chemicals.
Use a portable filtration device. This is particularly handy when hiking or camping in an area that is known to have rat bite fever. Filter the water and then add purifying chemicals.
Stick to bottled water if you are not sure about the local water. Always wipe off the top of bottled water with a clean rag before drinking.

, Your rat may be sick and in need of medical help if he starts acting strangely. Take him to a vet to get checked out—he may need a vaccination or might begin taking a medication. Symptoms that you should look out for include:


Sneezing.
Loss of appetite.
Bloody urine.
Missing fur.
Lack of energy.

Be aware of how you can contract rat bite fever.,
Look for symptoms of streptobacillary rat bite fever.,
Check for signs of spirillary rat bite fever.,
Clean the bite or scratch as soon as you notice it.,
Go to the hospital after you have cleaned the bite.,
Take antibiotics to treat rat bite fever.",How to Prevent Rat Bite Fever4," Rat bite fever is passed from rats to humans through the rat’s saliva, urine or feces. You can contract this disease by receiving a bite or scratch from a rat, or by coming into contact with something (like food) that has been contaminated with rat urine or feces. There are two forms of rat bite fever:


Streptobacillus Moniliformis: This disease is most commonly passed via a rat’s saliva. This form of rat bite fever is found in North America.
Spirillum Minus: The bacteria found in this form of rat bite fever also causes a disease called Haverhill Fever. It is most commonly found in Asia.

, As listed above, streptobacillary rat bite fever is caused by the streptobacillus moniliformis bacteria. Symptoms of this kind of fever become visible three to ten days after exposure to an infected rodent but can be delayed for as long as three weeks.Symptoms may include:


Fever: When your body senses foreign bacteria, it elevates your internal temperature to kill off the bacteria. This elevated temperature is what we call a fever.
Muscle pain: The area around the bite or scratch might become swollen and the muscles around the area might feel sore or achy.
Rash: You might notice flat, red bumps on your arms and legs. This rash generally appears two to four days after the fever starts.
Nausea and vomiting.
Headache.

, This sort of rat bite fever is caused by the Spirillum Minus bacteria. Signs and symptoms of spirillary rat bite fever occur 7-21 days after contact with an infected rodent. They can include:


Fever: The fever may come in waves, during which you might also experience chills.
Ulcers: In severe cases, you might also notice an ulcer forming at the spot where you were bitten or scratched. This generally only happens if you do not wash the bite and do not get treated at the hospital.
Swollen lymph-nodes: Lymph-nodes are meant to drain everything from the body and acts as a clearing agent of our body. But since the bacteria are multiple and the body can’t handle and digest them they go to the lymph-nodes in the same form and this leads to swollen lymph-nodes due to irritation of the lymph-nodes.
Inflammation: You might notice swelling around the spot where you were bitten or scratched. This is your body reacting to the bacteria in the rat’s saliva. Inflammatory chemicals are released by the immune system to fight the infection and cause the injured area to swell.
Rash: This generally occurs after the wound has already begun to heal. These rashes are a result of your body fighting the bacteria.

, If you notice any scratch or bite caused by a rodent, you should clean the bite with soap and water immediately. Once you have washed the cut or bite, put an antiseptic solution on it to be extra careful.You can also pour some hydrogen peroxide on the bite to ensure that any lingering bacteria are killed and removed from the wound.
Apply an antibacterial cream on the wound and then cover it with a sterile gauze before heading to the hospital.

, While it is important to do first-aid as described in the previous step, you should still go to the hospital if you are bitten by a rat that you think might be infected. At the hospital, a nurse will clean your wound again and give you medication that will combat any lingering bacteria that entered your body through the bite site.

, If you are bitten or contract rat bite fever, you will be prescribed antibiotics. Penicillin is the most common form of antibiotics prescribed for this specific disease. Patients allergic to penicillin are treated with erythromycin or tetracycline antibiotics.Adults are generally prescribed 400,000 to 600,000 IU/day (240 to 360 mg) of intravenous penicillin G for at least 7 days. This dose should be increased to 1.2 million IU/day (720 mg) if no response is seen within 2 days
Children should receive 20,000 to 50,000 IU per kg of body weight each day day (12 to 30 mg/kg/day) of intravenous penicillin G for 5 to 7 days. This is then followed by 7 days of oral penicillin V, 25 to 50 mg/kg/day (maximum, 3 g/day) taken four times per day.

Avoid eating meat.,
Use caution in high-risk areas.In the U.S., the most common areas for cysticercosis infection are California, Arizona, and Texas.,
Wash and peel your fruits and vegetables.Washing your produce thoroughly will remove Taenia solium larvae that cause cysticercosis.,
Wash your hands frequently.The importance of washing your hands when trying to prevent fecal-oral contamination cannot be overstated.,
Drink clean water.Because T. solium can be found in local water supplies, bottled or boiled water is the way to go when trying to avoid cysticercosis.If you boil water, let it boil for at least one minute before letting it cool to a drinkable temperature.",How to Prevent Cysticercosis (Pork Tapeworm Infection)1," While pork is the prime culprit for spreading T. solium, their eggs can also be found on meat that was stored or transported alongside pork. Meat infested with pork tapeworms cannot lead directly to cysticercosis, but it can lead to taeniasis, a tapeworm infection of the gut.


If you choose to eat meat, cook your meat well to destroy potential infestation of T. solium. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that your meat reaches temperatures greater than 149 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).Freezing or thoroughly cooking pork can destroy worms, but pickling and salting are not adequate techniques.;
, In Europe, most cases are reported in Spain and Portugal.The disease is more widespread in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where farms often do not adhere to strict sanitation guidelines and rates of infection are highest.


Look out for restaurants, too, when traveling through a high-risk area. Do not dine in establishments where employees do not wash their hands. They might accidentally transfer tapeworm larvae onto your food.

, Place your produce beneath cool, flowing tap water. Move the fruit or vegetable slowly around beneath the tap so that the entire surface is washed.


Do not dip your veggies and fruit in a bowl or sink filled with water. This will not clean them adequately.

, Use an antibacterial soap and scrub for at least twenty seconds.Be sure to scrub the backs of your hands and between your fingers in addition to washing your palms.


If you or someone you live with has taeniasis, you are at much higher risk of ingesting tapeworm larvae and developing cysticercosis.If you have children, teach them the importance of handwashing. Demonstrate how to do it several times until they get the hang of it.
You should take special care to wash your hands when preparing or eating food, changing diapers, and after using the toilet.

, Alternately, use an “absolute 1 micron or less” filter and dissolve iodine tablets in the water after filtering it.


Be sure to check the seal on your bottled water. Many restaurants in developing countries refill their water bottles with tap water and serve them to customers a second time.
”Absolute 1 micron or less” filters are available at camping supply stores.
Do not drink from fountains or use ice cubes in areas where pigs are allowed to roam freely or in countries where sanitation and hygiene are inadequate.

The infection is caused by spores of the Cryptococcus fungus carried by contact or infected by breathing-in the microscopic fungus (invisible to the eye).,
Be aware of the potential in your area for Cryptococcus gatti to be present.,
Note the three main types of Cryptococcus causing diseases: C. gattii, C. grubii, and C. neoformans.,
Be aware that this infection is non-contagious from those who are ill, but persons and animals (cats, dogs and llamas, plus porpoises) exposed in the environment may become infected and fall sick with this cryptococcal disease.,
Be aware that the fungus spreads on:


Trees – but note that you cannot tell which trees contain the fungus by looking at them as they appear normal and do not look sick.,
Those who are at a higher risk of contracting this disease include people who are:Older, over 50 years of age;
Users of oral steroids;
Smokers;
Those with weakened immune systems, for example:

HIV patients



",How to Avoid C Gattii Fungus Infection2," It is not transmitted from person to person or from animal to person. A person with cryptococcosis is not contagious., This tiny (microscopic) fungus similar to yeast (previously known to grow in the environment of certain warm, tropical countries) is parasitic and causes serious diseases in humans and animals. Why the fungus appeared on the east coast of Vancouver Island, B.C. in 1999 is not clear. It may have been imported or it may have always existed on Vancouver Island and increased in prevalence due to some climate or environmental changes.


Various Cryptococcus fungus are found growing and spreading in the environment in B.C. and in other places including tropical and subtropical climates in countries such as Brazil and Australia. The C. gattii variety of the cryptococcal fungus lives ""on trees and in the soil"". It was discovered due to finding recent human and animal cases of cryptococcusis, fungal illness, in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Department Regions, and it is now being found in other areas as well.In Washington State, U.S.A., C. gattii was first identified in cats in 2005; since that time dogs, cats and pet birds have been found to be infected. A small number of human cases have been reported from western Washington.It is not certain how Cryptococcus gattii spread from Vancouver Island to the North American mainland. It may have been transported through the air or on people, vehicles and products traveling from the Island to the mainland. More recently it has been found in the states of Washington and Oregon, as well as in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Regions.

, The C. neoformans and C. grubii cause illness mainly in people with ""impaired immune systems"". On the other hand, C. gattii can cause illness in otherwise healthy people as well as those with impaired immunity. Although C. gattii infection is rare, several Washington residents were recently discovered to be infected by C. gattii., About 25 people become sick from cryptococcosis every year in B.C., Canada. About one of 20 persons dies from the disease (5% mortality in those infected)., The fungus is tiny and cannot be seen with the naked eye. The fungus on trees can only be identified by testing tree samples in a laboratory.
In soil (which appears as normal soil).

Seek treatment from your usual medical professional.,
Seek early diagnosis for long lasting or severe symptoms (see symptoms above) and begin aggressive anti-fungal treatment, by being alert to tell your medical doctor or consult other physician (or veterinarian for animals).,
While you should remain confident that it is treatable, be aware that sometimes it may develop into several life threatening, severe forms such as:Growth of invasive nodules in the brain or lungs,

Fungal pneumonia, or
May develop meningitis (compare to spinal meningitis) -- a lethal nerve and brain lining disease;
Also skin infections are possible.

",How to Avoid C Gattii Fungus Infection3," It is likely that you will receive anti-fungal medication, and in almost all cases (95 percent) the forms of the disease can be treated successfully.

,


Request tests with doctors for persons who show symptoms. Screening tests are not performed on people without symptoms to see if they have been exposed.,"
"
At this stage, do not expect any particular precautions that can be taken to avoid cryptococcosis.",How to Avoid C Gattii Fungus Infection4," Presently there is no vaccine or preventive medications.The best thing to do is to recognize the symptoms as outlined above and to seek medical advice for treatment. When outdoors, take the usual precautions after touching plants and animals or drinking water, etc., such as washing hands, boiling water and being in good health if you plan on working with animals, etc.

Stay alert for other cyst hotspots.Neurocysticercosis is a variety of cysticercosis that occurs in the brain or spine.",How to Prevent Cysticercosis (Pork Tapeworm Infection)2," While these are often undetectable, they might form small bumps beneath your skin. These bumps may feel tender and sensitive.

, Your vision might be blurred or unfocused. Occasionally your eyes will become swollen. Eye cysts might also cause detachment of the retina, which can produce mottled vision, dark spots in your field of vision, or what appear to be bright flashes of light.Eye cysts, in extreme cases, can lead to blindness.
Get checked out immediately by a medical professional if you have any disruption in vision.

, You might feel lightheaded or faint due to the presence of cysts that prevent your heart from functioning normally. In serious cases you could suffer stroke, heart failure, and death., Cysts in either location may cause headaches and seizures. Cognitive difficulties — including confusion, nervousness, or an inability to concentrate — might also appear.


Other symptoms that cysts have developed in the brain or spine include a buildup of fluid in the brain which could lead to poor coordination, nausea or vomiting, and/or an inability to balance.
Neurocysticercosis is very dangerous and could lead to death.
Around 80% of neurocysticercosis infections have no symptoms.Treatment includes the combination praziquantel and albendazole, which has been associated with a higher rate success rate.

"
"
Contact your doctor immediately.In order to limit the impact of your infection, and prevent you from infecting others, it is important to seek treatment as soon as you become aware of your illness.,
Get tested.,
Take steroids.Corticosteroids (a class of medications that relieve inflammation) may be prescribed to reduce swelling, especially in the case of cysts located in your eye or brain.,
Take anti-parasitic drugs.There are several powerful antiparasitic drugs that a doctor might prescribe for you.,
Get surgery if necessary.In serious cases, especially cases where medication is ineffective, surgery may be necessary to remove cysts.",How to Prevent Cysticercosis (Pork Tapeworm Infection)3," Since the infection often does not produce any observable symptoms, it is important to get regular checkups. Try to see your physician at least once every six months.


You might exhibit symptoms anywhere from several weeks to 10 years after initial infection.

, There are a number of tests a doctor might run to determine if you have cysticercosis. You might, for instance, get a blood test to detect antibodies against the pork tapeworm. You might also get a biopsy, in which a needle is used to extract a small portion of your body’s tissue and look for signs of tapeworms. Finally, you might have an imaging exam such as an X-ray, CT or MRI scan, or an ultrasound to get a better idea of where the cysts are., Steroids are also useful for preventing adverse effects brought on by other anti-tapeworm medications.

, Two common drugs are albendazole and praziquantel. Praziquantel is a medication designed specifically for treating flatworms and flukes. Albendazole is a more generalized medication useful for treating a variety of parasitic infections, but tends to be the preferred treatment method for cysticercosis.

, Talk to your doctor about alternative options before getting surgery to treat cysticercosis.

Wash your hands properly before preparing and eating food, and after handling raw meat or fish.",How to Get Rid of Tapeworms in Humans," Tapeworms exist worldwide, but infection rates vary widely between countries. While more than 10 million people are infected each year,less than 1,000 cases are estimated to occur annually in the United States.Different species of tapeworms reside in different species of animals.


Pork and beef tapeworms are most commonly found in developing areas of the world such as Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, and especially where free-ranging pigs are common.Beef tapeworms are also more common in areas such as Eastern Europe, Russia, Eastern Africa, and Latin America where raw beef is sometimes consumed.Fish tapeworms are more common in areas where people eat raw fish, including Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan.Dwarf tapeworms are transmitted between humans, especially among children, in regions where sanitation is poor, or where humans are living in dense conditions.
Dog tapeworms occasionally find human hosts.;
, Infections typically occur following consumption of raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. Tapeworms can also be transmitted through meat that has been prepared by an infected individual.Have you consumed any raw or undercooked meat?
Have you been to an area where food is being prepared in unsanitary conditions?

, Excreted tapeworm segments are the most noticeable indicator of a tapeworm infection.These segments look like small grains of white rice.You may see excreted sections on toilet paper or in your underwear.Tapeworm segments will not begin to appear in the stool until two to three months after an adult tapeworm has established itself in your body.Stool samples may have to be examined on more than one occasion to find tapeworm segments., Common symptoms include digestive problems such as abdominal pain, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and nausea.However, these symptoms can indicate many other possible conditions. Remember, too, that a tapeworm infection may not cause any symptoms.


While uncommon, tapeworm infection can also cause the following serious symptoms: fever; cystic masses or lumps; allergic reactions to tapeworm larvae; bacterial infections; or neurological signs and symptoms, including seizures. These symptoms sometimes develop when infections are left untreated, so it's important to seek treatment even for less serious symptoms.

, In order to properly diagnose a tapeworm infection, your doctor will need to administer a stool sample analysis. This will help to rule out or determine the type of tapeworm and will determine the proper medicine(s).In addition to determining if you have a tapeworm, stool analysis can identify a variety of digestive problems, including infection, nutritional deficiencies, and cancer.A blood test may also be able to identify antibodies in the blood of a person who has been infected by a tapeworm., After your doctor or physician has diagnosed you with a tapeworm infection, he or she will prescribe an oral medication. Tapeworms are treated with three common prescriptions: praziquantel, albendazole, and nitazoxanide. The variety your doctor prescribes will depend upon the type of infection you have contracted. , In addition to properly taking your medication, it is important to avoid reinfecting yourself (or infecting others). Tapeworm medications do not affect the parasites' eggs, so you can reintroduce the infection if you neglect good bathroom and kitchen hygiene.If more serious infection such as cysticercosis is involved, your doctor may recommend a longer and more involved treatment regimen. Treatment may include prescription drugs, anti-inflammatory, and anti-epileptic therapy, or surgery., Your physician will want to re-evaluate you after you have been taking your medication for some time. Depending on the severity of the infection, this can be anywhere from one to three months after you begin treatment.Prescription medication is 85 to 100 percent effective. Effectiveness depends on the type of tapeworm and the location of the infection., Many different species that humans eat carry tapeworms, including cattle, pigs, fish, sheep, goats, and rabbits. Eliminating raw or undercooked meat from your diet is the easiest way to avoid infection.Note that poultry tapeworms do exist, but are not common in modern farming facilities because they require an intermediate insect host such as an earthworm or beetle., When cooking whole cuts of meat such as steaks or chops, be sure that the internal temperature of the meat reaches at least 145 °F (63 °C). Ground meat should be cooked to an internal temperatures of 160 °F (71 °C).Freezing meat and fish at a temperature below 14 °F ( -10 °C) for at least 48 hours will also kill tapeworm eggs and larvae., Chemical solutions can be purchased to sanitize fruit and vegetables, or you can simply wash them thoroughly with safe (boiled) water., This will make sure that any eggs or larvae on your hands are not transferred into your food or digestive system. You'll also avoid infecting other people.


Make sure to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Try humming either the alphabet song or ""Happy Birthday to You"" twice to ensure you're washing for an adequate length of time.

This virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, most commonly those of the Aedes aegypti mosquito.Aside from chikungunya, the Aedes aegypti mosquito can transmit other diseases such as dengue and yellow fever.
The Aedes aegypti mosquito can easily be identified by the unique white markings on its legs and body. Originally, this mosquito was only found in Africa, but now it is found in subtropical and tropical regions across the globe.
The mosquito is attracted to human blood by certain chemical compounds emitted by the body, such as ammonia, lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and octenol.;
, The Aedes aegypti mosquito is known to be more active during the early and late hours of the day.


However, these mosquitoes can bite at any time of the day and in any season. In addition to this, Aedes aegypti is more common in dark, shady areas, and indoors.The most common breeding area of Aedes aegypti is stagnant water. This includes the water found in flower vases, discarded tires, buckets, uncovered barrels, bottles, and others.
The lifespan of Aedes aegypti may last up to one month. However, its eggs are resistant to cold and heat. Thus, these mosquitoes can easily make a comeback after the summer and winter.

, One of the best ways to protect yourself from chikungunya virus is to go directly to the mosquito's breeding grounds and eliminate as many mosquitoes and eggs as possible.


The most common breeding area for the Aedes aegypti mosquito is standing water. Therefore, the first step is to empty any open containers of water around your home.
Next, look for any possible reservoirs of water around your home or backyard that may serve as a place for mosquitoes to reproduce. This may include discarded tires, flower vases, cans, bottles, rain gutters, drums, and more.

, It should be noted that female Aedes aegypti are attracted to the scent of bacteria found in stagnant water, so when you clean your surroundings, there will be less stagnant water and therefore fewer mosquitoes.


Cleanliness is the key to destroying the homes of mosquitoes, therefore you should make sure that you clean your water drainage system. Also keep in mind that stagnant rivers, creeks, or canals may also serve as a breeding ground for these mosquitoes.
In the event that a creek or river is filled with plants or garbage to the point that the water cannot flow anymore, make a concerted effort with your community to implement a clearing program which will get the water flowing again.

, Fish are great for keeping mosquitoes under control. Since ponds and other still bodies of water may attract Aedes aegypti, adding fish to the water will help to decrease the number of mosquito eggs and larvae as they will be eaten by the fish. This method may serve as a long-term solution for mosquito control.


The most common type of fish that feeds on mosquitoes is the Gambusia affinis, better known as the mosquitofish. Other fish may include minnow, carp, tilapia, and killfish.
You should also promote populations of other animals that prey on mosquitoes. This includes lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, birds, bats, and others.

, Mosquito traps involve the creation of an artificial breeding ground for the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Then, once the mosquitoes have laid their eggs, the eggs can be destroyed manually or special chemicals can be added to the traps to kill the larvae.


The most common mosquito trap is the lethal ovitrap. Originally, this type of trap was used to study mosquito populations, but it was later found that scientists could simply add chemicals to the trap to kill both the eggs and the larva. Lethal ovitraps are effectively used to protect against chikungunya, yellow fever, dengue fever, and west Nile virus.
A light trap is another good mosquito control device. A blue or violet colored UV light is used to attract the mosquitoes. Once inside the trap, the insects are either electrocuted or are caught in a sticky board.

, You can protect against mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing, such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts. You should also ensure that the material is thick enough to prevent the mosquitoes from penetrating the cloth.


If the weather is humid, choose loose clothing which allows air to circulate around your body. Loose clothing will also create a space between your clothing and skin which makes it harder for mosquitoes to reach your skin.
Mosquitoes are also attracted to body heat, so it's a good idea to opt for light colored clothing which doesn't absorb too much heat and allows your body to stay cool.

, It's possible to buy special laundry detergents containing mosquito repellent which you can wash your clothes with. After washing, the clothes will repel mosquitoes while you wear them.


Alternatively, you could just spray insect repellent on your clothing.

, Hanging mosquito nets around your bed will prevent you from getting bitten while you sleep.


To add further protection, you can use mosquito nets that have been chemically treated with insect repellent.
Also think about adding insect screens to your windows and doors. This will prevent mosquitoes from coming into your house through open spaces.

, Mosquito repellent should contain at least 30% to 50% of DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide). However, a higher percentage than this may result in skin irritation.


If you are applying sunscreen at the same time as mosquito repellent, make sure to apply the sunscreen first and the repellent after. Otherwise it won't be as effective.Mosquito repellent containing the ingredient ""picaridin"" should only have 15% of this ingredient to prevent skin irritation.

, If you are looking for an extreme but effective method of protecting yourself against chikungunya, you could consider relocating to an area where mosquitoes are not common.


If you are looking for a new home, look for an area where big bodies of stagnant water are not common such as swamps, marshes, and jungles.
Of course, relocating can be costly and is not a practical solution for the majority of people.

, Be vigilant about the presence of mosquitoes. If possible, it is better to catch and kill a mosquito while it's in the air rather than waiting for it to land on you.


If you wait for it to land on you first, it may have had the chance to bite you before it died. This increases the chance that you will develop chikungunya.
The best way to kill a mosquito is to use a mosquito swatter, as it exponentially increases your chances of killing the mosquito while it's at rest.

, People infected with chikungunya will experience severe pain in the joints, especially in the joints of the lower limbs such as the ankles, knees and hip joints and in the joints of the upper limbs such as elbows, shoulders and wrists. Backache is rarely seen with this disease.


The joint pain is often described as aching or throbbing in nature. Redness and swelling are also present in addition to the joint pain. The joint will be very tender to the touch and the sufferer may have difficulty in moving their joints.
Sometimes, the sufferer may be unable to move their joints due to severe pain, causing difficulties in walking, standing up from a sitting position , running, writing, driving, picking things up, etc.

, Aside from joint pain, secondary symptoms of chikungunya fever include nausea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and photophobia (hypersensitivity to light). Sometimes, a person's sense of taste is also affected.

, In its initial stages, chikungunya fever presents itself with symptoms such as:


Low grade fever or increased body temperature, malaise, a reduction in feelings of hunger etc. Sometimes vomiting is also present.
After five to seven days, the joint pain begins. It starts with mild difficulties in movement and pain in the joints early in the morning. The patient may even have difficulty getting out of bed. However, this pain should start to subside as the day progresses.
For more information on recognizing the symptoms of Chikungunya fever, see this article.

, If a patient is suspected of having Chikungunya, their blood will be taken in order to perform a special type of blood test called an ELISA test. This test is used to detect the presence of immune antibodies in the system, which could indicate the presence of chikungunya.

, Your blood serum will also be tested to check for the presence of Chikungunya viral RNA, however this can usually only be found in the first 5 to 8 days following infection., The World Health Organization has also provided some criteria to confirm a Chikungunya fever diagnosis. These include:


Presence of fever above 38.5 degree Celsius (101.3 degrees Fahrenheit), and presence of severe joint or muscle pain without any other medical or orthopedic conditions.
Person visited epidemic area 15 days before infection.
Presence of positive laboratory tests, as described above.

, The virus is self-limiting, which means that it will resolve itself over time. Therefore, treatment is focused on easing the symptoms such as joint pain and fever using medications and home-care methods.For more information on recovering from Chikungunya, see this article.

, Place a warm compress over painful, aching joints for up to 30 minutes, three times a day.


The heat from the warm compress increases blood flow to the affected joint which helps to decrease joint inflammation and stiffness and muscle tension.
Increased blood flow also promotes the healing process as the blood helps to carry nutrients to the joints and remove toxins and waste products.

, Massaging the joints by applying deep pressure and using a pain reliever gel can be very effective for easing stiffness and pain.


Opt for massage gels that contain ingredients such as Diclofenac gel, linseed oil, camphor etc., as these help to relieve pain.
Massage is safe to use several times a day, or as needed., Apply a cold pack over the affected joint twice a day for at least 20 minutes at a time in order to relieve inflammation and pain.


Make sure the cold pack is covered in a cloth or towel, as allowing the skin to come in direct contact with the cold can be damaging.

, Severe joint pain can be somewhat alleviated through the use of painkillers. For chikungunya sufferers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended. These drugs work by blocking pain signals to the brain level while also providing anti-inflammatory properties.


Ibuprofen: This works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormones responsible for producing pain signals. The dosage is 4 to 6 mg per kg every 6 or 12 hours, depending on the severity of the pain.
Naproxen: This drug is well established in the treatment of moderate pain. It works by inhibiting cyclogenase, a substance which is responsible for the production of prostaglandins. The initial dosage is 500 mg every 12 hours.

Get your pets vaccinated.,
Supervise your pets when they're outdoors.,
Reduce the stray population in your neighborhood.,
Don't handle wild animals.,
Be careful when you're abroad.",How to Prevent a Rabies Infection1," The most common way for humans to get rabies infections is by way of their pets. Having your dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated is an important form of prevention, both for you and for them. Take your pets to the vet to start the process right away.;
, Do not allow them to come in contact with wild animals. Mammals like squirrels, raccoons, opossums, and bats can carry rabies and pass them to dogs, cats and ferrets by biting them. Keep your animals on a leash or behind a fence to prevent this from happening.


The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends keeping cats and ferrets indoors at all times for this reason.If you wish to let your dog loose in a natural area, talk with authorities about whether rabies is a problem in that area beforehand.

, Call your local Animal Control Center to pick up stray animals from your neighborhood. Have your pets spayed or neutered. This can help reduce the large number of unwanted pets, most of which will not be vaccinated.


Ensure that your children are aware they should never handle stray animals, wild or domesticated.

, Do not handle, feed, or attempt to attract wild animals to your home. Do not adopt wild animals. Being around wild animals puts you and your pets at risk for contracting rabies.


When traveling, avoid contact with wild animals, especially dogs in developing countries.
Do not attempt to nurse sick or wounded wild animals. Call your local Animal Control Center or a veterinarian.
Take steps to prevent bats from entering living quarters or homes, schools, workplace, and other similar areas, where they may come in contact with people and/or pets.

, Certain countries still have high rates of rabies infections. Consult with a doctor, travel clinic, or your local health department before traveling abroad. Ask them about the risk of exposure to rabies, pre exposure prophylaxis, and what you should do in case of an exposure to the virus.

Vaccinate yourself against rabies.,
Call local authorities.",How to Diagnose Rabies in Humans," The most common way that people are infected with rabies is when they are bitten by a wild, feral, or unvaccinated animal. Ultimately, bites by animals should be treated with caution because of the many diseases that can be transmitted through them.


The saliva of an infected animal is the most common way that rabies is spread.
Any bite by a wild, stray, or feral animal should get immediate medical attention.
Assume that an animal carries rabies unless someone can present you with documentation that the animal has been vaccinated.;
, While bites are the most common way that rabies are transmitted to us, the disease can also be transmitted by scratches. Thus, you should consider all animal-inflicted wounds as a possible way that the rabies virus can be introduced into your body.


Never dismiss a small scratch as a risk. Even small scratches pose the risk of rabies infection.
Scratches inflicted by feral or stray cats and dogs may spread rabies.
The most common way for scratches to transmit rabies is when an infected animal’s saliva is involved., While animal-inflicted wounds are the most common way that rabies is spread, it can also be introduced into pre-existing wounds.


Fresh wounds and wounds that have not scabbed over are very susceptible to rabies infection.
Any wound or injury that is bleeding and comes in contact with the saliva of an infected animal offers a risk of rabies infection., The majority of rabies infections are associated with particular wild animals. Animals that commonly carry rabies include:


Bats
Raccoons
Skunks
Woodchucks
Foxes
Wolves., Rabies often manifests as flu-like symptoms early on -- usually within two weeks of infection. Thus, many people incorrectly assume that they are suffering a semi-regular illness rather than a life-threatening ailment. Flu-like symptoms might appear as:


Weakness
Fever
Headache
General discomfort., After being infected, the initial point of infection may begin to exhibit an itching or a prickling sensation. This is one of the earliest clinical signs of infection.


Itching may begin to occur within several days after initial infection.
Itching may or may not be accompanied by redness or other signs of a bacterial infection.
The wound might also have a tingling sensation.
Have a medical professional evaluate any animal-inflicted wound that looks or feels strange., The loss of cognitive ability is the most serious sign of rabies infection. Once a person exhibits cognitive deterioration, the condition is usually fatal and the only treatment available is supportive.,, When seeking medical treatment, you'll need details about the incident and the suspected rabid animal. This information will help medical professionals treat you and help authorities protect public health.


Determine what type of animal is responsible. If possible, find out if a dog is stray or belongs to someone.
Figure out if the animal was provoked, teased, or scared before biting.
Find out the animal’s vaccination status.
Describe whether the animal was sick, injured, or appeared in good health., Never delay seeking medical help after you suspect being exposed to rabies, whether you’ve been bitten or not. Without immediate medical attention, you’ll be putting your life at risk. Rabies can only be treated in a brief window before the infection takes hold. When you seek treatment, a doctor will:


Cleanse the wound with soap and water.
Irrigate the wound with a solution to kill any virus or bacteria present.
Apply topical antibiotic ointment.

, The most common course of action, if it is determined you are at risk for contracting rabies, is to be vaccinated against it after seeking medical treatment. Immediate vaccination is the only way to prevent rabies from spreading and infecting you. There are two vaccines: A fast-acting shot to prevent the virus from infecting you, and a series of rabies vaccines to help the body learn to identify an fight the virus.Vaccination needs to be done immediately.
Vaccination is perhaps the only way to prevent death of an infected person.
Vaccination should only be done if you have not previously been exposed or vaccinated.
The rabies vaccine will be administered in the deltoid muscle of your upper arm. Children may receive theirs in the thigh.
You may need to visit a hospital or contact county or state health authorities if your doctor does not have the vaccine on hand., After seeking medical treatment, make sure to call animal control and other authorities to report the animal suspected to be carrying rabies. Without reporting it, your local authorities will be unaware of a potential rabies outbreak among wild or domestic animals.


Animal control may attempt to capture or euthanize the animal.
In many cases, animal control will turn over the animal to a pathologist who will conduct an examination on the deceased animal’s brain tissue. This is the only way to confirm rabies infection.
You may also consider contacting your local, state, or county health department to inform them of the attack."

Obesity may also lead to anxiety, depression, and self-esteem issues which could negatively affect sexual health.

, Avoiding processed foods also helps eliminate additional sugars and salt that are added to foods and emphasizes foods with the highest nutritional density and quality. Eating unprocessed foods helps you eliminate most of the things from your diet that lead to obesity, while replacing them with healthy, natural foods, like fruits, vegetables, and lean meats.


Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as possible. Eating natural helps you avoid synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, and hormones that can be found in non-organic or processed foods. These harmful additives can potentially affect your overall health and hormones.

, At least 80 – 90% of the total carbohydrates in your diet should be complex carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are recommended to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.Refrain from eating simple carbs.


Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods, such as whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.
Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods. A good rule is to never eat white foods. This means no white bread, white pasta, or white rice. Also avoid candies, cookies, cakes, and other snack foods.
This helps control weight gain because complex carbohydrates take longer to digest. This allows you to feel fuller longer, which generally means that you are likely to eat less.

, You should reduce the amount of sugar in your diet. You can avoid any added sugars by sticking to unprocessed foods. Reading labels can help you figure out how much sugar is in a food.


Simple carbs also include sugars added to foods, like glucose, sucrose, fructose, and high fructose corn syrup.
Processed foods include both simple carbohydrates and added sugars, which can increase the risk of various disorders including weight gain.

, Eating more fruits and vegetables can help you maintain a healthy weight. Increase your daily fruit and vegetable intake. These foods provide your body with essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed for optimal sexual health.


Use as many organic fruits and vegetables as you can. Choose organic when possible since pesticide use is associated with decreased sexual health., Increase the fiber in your diet. Beans, legumes and vegetables provide great sources of fiber, but these foods also provide vitamins and minerals (including the important B vitamins) to boost your sexual health.


Fiber helps keep you fuller longer, which can help you refrain from overeating.

, When you eat meat, eat lean sources. Increase the amounts of skinless poultry you eat. Limit your red meat intake.


The poultry you buy should be hormone and antibiotic free and free-range.When you do eat red meat, make sure to eat grass-fed and antibiotic and hormone-free beef and buffalo.Don’t eat the skin on the poultry. The skin can be high in animal fat as well as any added hormones and antibiotics.

Eat enough protein.,
Eat foods with iron.,
Fill up on fish.,
Eat foods rich in beta carotene.,
Try Greek yogurt.,
Eat your greens.,
Keep stress down with almonds.,
Increase your zinc intake with oysters.,
Drink your vitamin D. Vitamin D and calcium are important to keeping your nails strong, and you can drink them in a glass of low-fat milk.",How to Improve Hair and Nails Through Your Diet1," Your body needs keratin to make your hair and nails strong, and your body creates keratin from protein sources.Your body may stop hair growth for a period if you aren't getting enough protein. On average, an adult male needs about 56 grams of protein per day, while an adult female needs about 46 grams of protein. As a reference point, 3 ounces of meat has about 21 grams of protein, while a cup of milk has about 8 grams of protein.Eggs are also a great source of protein.;
, Red meat is a good source of iron, and if you're anemic, iron is a must, as your hair can thin out over time. You should be getting a serving of (lean) red meat once a week.If red meat isn't something you're interested in, try eating a iron-fortified cereal.Many vegetable sources also contain iron, from spinach to lentils.You should get at least 18 milligrams of iron per day.Three ounces of oysters has 8 milligrams, while a half a cup of lentils and a half a cup of spinach both have 3 milligrams each.Even if you are not anemic, you may suffer from accelerated hair loss if you are not getting enough iron.

, Fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids encourage your hair grow and make it shiny.You should eat fish high in omega-3s at least twice a week. You can also eat albacore tuna, catfish, and halibut. Also, incorporate walnuts, tofu, and canola oil into your diet., Your body produces vitamin A from beta carotene. Vitamin A is essential in keeping your skin healthy over time. It also encourages your hair and nails to grow.Carrots, leafy greens such as spinach and broccoli, and peas are great sources of vitamin A.Sweet potatoes are also a good choice.Your body needs at least 5,000 international units of vitamin A per day.A half cup of carrots has 9,189 international units per serving, while a whole, baked sweet potato has 28,058 international units., Greek yogurt has more protein than regular yogurt, making it a good choice for keeping hair and nails healthy. It's also rich in vitamin B5, which increases blood flow and helps your hair grow.Try incorporating Greek yogurt into your breakfast routine. Eat Greek yogurt with some fresh fruit, or mix is with some honey and muesli.
Another great option for increasing blood flow is cinnamon. Try sprinkling a bit over your yogurt to make it more effective., Dark, leafy greens such as spinach and kale provide a wide variety of vitamins, from iron to folate and vitamin C. They keep your hair and nails healthy, and they also keep your hair from being too dry.Try using baby spinach or kale as a base for a salad, or add them to a morning smoothie. You can also use them in stir fry.

, Almonds are rich in magnesium, and magnesium helps keep your stress levels down. Because stress can thin out your hair, you should try to keep your stress down for beautiful hair.The U.S. Government recommends that you eat 400 milligrams of magnesium per day.An ounce of dry roasted almonds has about 80 milligrams.Other good sources include spinach, which has 78 milligrams per half cup, cashews, which have 74 milligrams per ounce, and soymilk, which has 61 milligrams per cup., Oysters are a great source of zinc, and zinc is essential for creating proteins in your body. Since your hair and nails are essentially made of proteins, you need to make sure you get your daily intake of zinc.You need about 15 milligrams of zinc per day, according to the U.S. Government.You can also try eating pumpkin seeds, which have 2.57 milligrams per 1/4 cup. Try sprinkling them on a salad or eating them as a snack., They may also help your hair to grow.The government recommends 400 international units of vitamin D and 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day.One cup of milk has 300 milligrams of calciumand 115-124 international units of vitamin D."

Know if you are at risk.,
Wash your hands after handling your cat.,
Go to the doctor if you suspect you might have CSD.,
Adopt older cats instead of kittens.,
Don’t let your cats lick your wounds.,
Don’t pet or touch stray or feral cats.,
Keep your environment clean.,
Protect your cat from fleas.,
Keep your cat’s nails trimmed.,
Schedule routine veterinary check-ups.,
Keep your cat indoors.",How to Prevent Cat Scratch Disease," Some people are more likely to get CSD than others. Organ transplant patients, infants and young children, and pregnant women are more likely to get diseases from animals.Those who are immunocompromised, or have a weak immune system, such as people with HIV, should be extra careful about getting CSD., Always wash your hands with soap and water after playing with your cat. Don’t play with your cats too rough or they might hurt you. If your cat bites or scratches you, wash the wound with soap and water immediately. If you start to feel ill after getting a scratch or bite, go to the doctor., Cat scratch disease is hard to diagnose, but if your doctor suspects you have it they might run tests. If you have an infection at the site of a scratch or bite and/or feel ill and fatigued, you might have CSD. Typically, CSD is not serious and does not require any treatment. Sometimes you might be given an antibiotic, especially if you have a weak immune system. If you are immunocompromised, CSD becomes more serious.Physical symptoms include swelling around the cat bite or scratch, and swollen lymph nodes, especially around the head, neck, and arms. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, and headache. Rarely, it causes vision problems, liver disease, and confusion.

, Instead of adopting kittens, adopt cats that are over one year old. Kittens and young cats are more likely to carry CSD and are more likely to give you CSD because they are more likely to scratch.If you have a weak immune system this is especially important.Cats live long lives, so you still will have many years with your senior cat and older cats are not as demanding as kittens., This is another way that your cat can spread the bacteria that causes CSD to you. If you see your cat licking a cut or an open wound of any kind, stop them. Cover your wounds with bandages to avoid your cat being able to lick them. If you cat does lick your wound, make sure to wash it thoroughly with soap and water., The cat might not have an owner who is taking care of them, which means they are more likely to have CSD. You don’t know how a cat might react if you touch them. If you try to pet an unknown cat, they could scratch you and give you CSD., It is important to keep your house clean and free of fleas to prevent getting CSD. Vacuum your carpets regularly. To give them an extra clean use Borax or a carpet cleaner. You can also get your carpets professionally cleaned if they are particularly dirty.


When you move into a house or apartment you should make sure to get the carpets and floors thoroughly cleaned.
Before you vacuum, shake and punch out your cushions and pillows on the floor.
Wash all your bedding in the hottest water possible to kill fleas., The bacteria that causes CSD is carried by fleas, making it a major risk factor for CSD in cats. When they bite or leave flea dirt on your cat it can cause your cat to get CSD. Apply preventative flea product to your cat once a month. Make sure that the flee medicine is approved by your veterinarian because there are flee products that are harmful to cats.


Check your cat regularly for fleas with a flea comb.Regularly bathe your cat to remove any flea dirt off of them.Purchase a self-releasing collar for your cat that prevents fleas.

, Every few weeks you should trim your cat's claws to maintain your cat's health. You can get CSD from your cat biting or scratching you hard enough to break the skin, so it is important to keep your cat's nails short. Nail-trimming is a fast, effective and humane alternative to declawing. Use special nail clippers designed to safely cut their claws. Restrain your cat with a helper or by using the crook of your arm.


Press down with your thumb on the joint behind the claw then quickly cut the nail.
Don't cut the pink part of the nail; if you do your cat will bleed. If this happens apply pressure to the wound.
Don't continue if your cat is too upset. You don't have to do all the claws at once., Although CSD usually has no symptoms in cats, on rare occasions it can cause inflammation of the heart (which can make your cat very sick). It is important to regularly go to the vet to make sure your cat is healthy and that they don’t have flees. You should go to the veterinarian at least once a year, and immediately if your cat becomes sick or hurt., If you really want to prevent CSD, especially if you have a weak immune system, you should keep your cat indoors. Cats can get CSD from fighting with other cats who have CSD. If another cat scratches your cat, they can get the bacteria and spread it to you. Outdoor cats are also more likely to pick up flees, which also can cause CSD."

If the malnutrition is especially severe, you may need to be tube-fed with a special liquid diet.

, The damage to your liver may mean that it isn’t able to store energy efficiently. If this has happened to your liver, you will need to eat extra to make up for what your body isn’t able to store.Eating five to six small meals with healthy snacks may be helpful.
Increase your intake of simple carbohydrates by eating fruits and your consumption of complex carbohydrates by eating whole-grain breads, potatoes, corn, peas, parsnips, lentils, beans, and nuts.You can also supplement carbohydrates with a moderate amount of fat. This will provide you with extra energy.If you lost weight while drinking, this may be because your body started breaking down muscle tissue to get the nutrients it needed.

, What your doctor recommends may vary based on how severe the liver damage is.


Some sources recommend an increased amount of protein to provide energy.Other sources say that because a damaged liver may be unable to process the proteins, this could lead to the accumulation of toxins. In this case, it may be necessary for you to reduce the amount of protein you eat., B vitamins are particularly important, but make sure you also include vitamin K and phosphate and magnesium.B vitamins are necessary for your body to break down the food you eat and process it into energy. Thiamine, folate, and pyridoxine are types of B vitamins with which you can supplement.
Fish, chicken, turkey, meat, eggs, dairy products, beans, peas, and leafy green vegetables have B vitamins.If you aren’t getting enough vitamins from your diet, your doctor or nutritionist can recommend supplements. Always consult with a medical professional before adding any supplements, even herbal remedies, to be sure that your liver will be able to process it.

Do not take street drugs. They may further damage your liver.
Avoid toxic chemicals such as fungicides, insecticides, aerosol sprays, and other fumes. If you must be around them, wear a mask.

, If your liver is badly damaged, these drugs may be beneficial.They are usually not prescribed for patients with kidney failure, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or an infection.
Doctors usually prescribe prednisolone for 28 days. While on steroids, your doctor will have to monitor your blood glucose.
Approximately two out of five people are not helped by corticosteroids.

,
Pentoxifylline inhibits the cytokines that lead to more liver damage. This drug may be beneficial for those with mild to moderate liver disease.
Sometimes both corticosteroids and pentoxifylline are used together.

, These medications are controversial because there isn’t a lot of scientific evidence supporting their use.


Anabolic steroids are strong steroids.
Propylthiouracil was originally created as a thyroid medication.

Look for early, mild symptoms.,
Watch for acute symptoms.,
Pay attention to moderate symptoms.,
Keep in mind that leptospirosis may have a sudden or slow onset.,
Consider your dog’s environment.",How to Diagnose Canine Leptospirosis1," After a dog has been infected with leptospirosis, the first symptoms will take about one week to appear. Early signs of leptospirosis may not be easy to detect, but a dog that has just been infected with leptospirosis may have symptoms that include:fever
lethargy (low energy and sleeping more than usual);
, If a dog has the acute (sudden, serious illness) form of leptospirosis, then the condition can kill the dog within 48 hours. Seek immediate veterinary attention for a dog with acute symptoms of leptospirosis. Acute symptoms may include:profuse vomiting
liquid bloody diarrhea
collapse
shock
loss of consciousness
dark urine
jaundice (yellowing of the gums and/or the whites of the eyes)
extreme thirst

, If the dog has a less severe form of leptospirosis, then he may have some moderate symptoms. Even though the symptoms may not seem too serious, you will still need to seek veterinary treatment for your dog dog. Some symptoms of moderate leptospirosis include:fever
vomiting
diarrhea
thirst
weight loss

, Leptospirosis can cause a sudden severe illness or develop over time. Leptospirosis also shares some of the same symptoms as other conditions, such as distemper and infectious canine hepatitis, so you may want to consider other possible causes of your dog's illness as well.If you even suspect that your dog is ill, then take him to see a veterinarian as soon as possible.

, Leptospira bacteria enters the dog's body through damaged skin or from swallowing the bacteria. Dogs that are exposed to moist environments and rats are at a higher risk of developing leptospirosis. Working or hunting dogs are also at increased risk due to minor cuts and scrapes that they get from being outside and doing their jobs."

Eat well balanced meals.,
Eat adequate servings of each food group.,
Drink adequate fluids daily.,
Avoid foods that are overly high in fat or sodium.,
Continue to educate yourself about nutrition.,
Work to truly enjoy your meals.,
Eat consistent and regular meals.,
Take advantage of local or cultural foods.,
Reduce food waste.,
Aim to be active every day.,
Add in strength training.,
Get active in your leisure time.",How to Improve Your Health Following Japanese Dietary Guidelines," As many cultures do, the Japanese Dietary Guidelines recommend eating well balanced meals. The concept is very similar to that in the US; however, the Japanese guidelines suggest emphasizing certain foods.


It's first recommended to make sure you have a ""staple food"" at each meal. This is in the form of a grain like noodles or rice.
There's also an emphasis on combining fruits, vegetables, dairy, beans and fish in the diet. The combination of these foods helps you to meet your daily needs and helps balance meals.
The Japanese guidelines do allow for beef or pork, but many Japanese people do not eat these foods often. Most of their protein is coming from seafood and legumes.;
, The Japanese guidelines use a spinning top to show how many servings of each food group should be eaten every day. It's similar in concept to the Food Pyramid in the US.


The biggest food group is the grain group (because it's a staple food). It's recommended to have at least one serving of grains at each meal and aim for five to seven servings daily.Each serving size should be 40 grams (or about 1/4 cup of rice).
The next largest group is the vegetable group or vegetable dishes. The Japanese guidelines suggest eating five to six servings of a vegetable dish daily. Each serving size is 70 grams (or a little over 1/3 cup or chopped vegetables).
It's recommended to only have three to five servings of fish and meat daily with the portion size being 6 grams a serving (about 2 ounces). Again, most Japanese people eat fish and legumes over pork and beef.
The smallest group on the spinning top is a combination of fruits and dairy foods. It's only suggested to have two servings of these foods everyday with the portion size being 100 grams for both (2/3 cup of chopped vegetables or under 1/2 cup of milk).

, The Japanese guidelines recommend drinking an adequate amount of fluid each day. This is featured at the top of their spinning top food guide to visualize its importance.


The fluids that are primarily emphasized are water and tea. Tea traditional is served unsweetened and without added sugar.
Similarly to the US, the Japanese guidelines discourage the intake of sweetened beverages. It's recommended to limit your intake of sweetened beverages like sodas, fruit juice cocktails or alcoholic beverages.

, There are foods that are discouraged in the Japanese Dietary Guidelines. Those that are overly high in sodium or fat should be limited in the diet.If you eat foods that are high in sodium and fat regularly or in large quantities your weight may increase. In addition, your risk for high blood pressure and stroke increase as well.Although the guidelines do not recommend avoiding these foods altogether, make sure to limit foods like: chips, fast foods, fried foods, processed meats (like hot dogs or salami), frozen meals and canned foods.

, The Japanese Dietary Guidelines are not only about eating specific foods or eating certain quantities of foods. They also emphasize the importance of nutrition and health knowledge.The Japanese Dietary Guidelines emphasize the need for Shokuiku. This is the need to continue to learn and educate yourself about good nutrition and eating habits.
The Japanese government has educational programs that help individuals, families and communities learn about and implement sound dietary habits.
In your local area, search for nutrition programs. You might find them through community centers, churches or fitness centers. In addition, the US government has a variety of educational resources online that can be used to further your nutrition knowledge.

, Eating mindfully is not something that has been emphasized significantly in the US Dietary Guidelines; however, mindful eating is something the Japanese guidelines recommend you implement in addition to good nutrition.


One technique that is used in Japanese culture is known as Hara Hachi Bu or ""eat until you are 80% full.""In order to stop eating at 80% full, it's recommended to take your time, eat slowly and chew slowly. This allows you to realize when you are satisfied and not full.
In addition, when you're taking your time, you have the opportunity to fully enjoy your foods and your meal as a whole. This can also help you be satisfied with less.

, The Japanese guidelines also stress the importance of eating regular and consistent meals. They suggest developing an eating schedule and sticking to it.It's important to make sure you eat regularly. You want to eat a meal or snack every four hours or so. You may eat three main meals plus one snack or end up eating five smaller meals daily. This will vary based on your schedule and preference.
If you skip meals, you generally feel more fatigued, may get a headache, are more likely to skip an afternoon workout and are also more likely to overeat (especially higher fat foods).Develop an eating schedule for yourself. You might want to draft up a meal plan with times so you can see when each of your meals and snacks are.

, An interesting emphasis of the Japanese Dietary Guidelines is the suggestion to take advantage of local or cultural foods. This is something you may not expect in dietary guidelines; however, doing so may help support a varied diet.If you try to focus on local foods or cultural dishes, you open yourself up for an increased variety of different foods. You may try new foods or dishes that can help you meet the daily recommended intakes of each food.
Try going to local farmer's markets or farm stands if they're available. These locally grown foods may be less expensive and more flavorful than store bought.If you live in a city, try going to different ethnic restaurants. Or if there is an area in your city that features different cuisines, visit some of those restaurants. You'll be able to try new things or foods prepared in new ways.

, Another unique focus of the Japanese Dietary Guidelines is the suggestion to try to reduce food waste. They emphasize the need to think through your meal planning, cooking and food usage during the week.Start by planning out your meals for the week. Having a plan in place can help you buy a limited amount of groceries and avoid purchasing things you don't need or won't use.
Also plan to keep leftovers. If you cook larger quantities of something, make sure you have a plan for those leftovers. You can pack them for lunch the next day or freeze them for a quick meal later in the month.
Keep an eye on your foods during the week. If there is a food that will spoil more quickly, make sure to cook that first so it doesn't go bad during the week.

, The Japanese Dietary Guidelines do not only focus on eating habits and nutrition. Like the US guidelines, they also provide guidance and recommendations on physical activity.


The Japanese exercise guidelines are overarching. It's suggested to be active for at least 60 minutes a day (a much higher amount compared to the US); however, it doesn't specifically say how much time should be spent on different types of activities.These guidelines do give recommendations to those people with chronic diseases like high blood pressure. It is thought that physical activity is a beneficial lifestyle remedy for some of these chronic conditions.
Any type of activity can be done to reach your 60 minutes daily. The Japanese guidelines suggest anything from housework, gardening, water aerobics, walking or running.

, The Japanese Dietary Guidelines do not have a specific recommendation for strength training. These exercises are done as part of your 60 minutes of activity each day.Strength training exercises that are suggested include: calisthenics or weight lifting exercises.
These guidelines do give recommendations if you have experienced loss of muscle mass or strength. It's advised to focus on strength training activities to help support your body as you age.

, The Japanese Dietary Guidelines emphasize making leisure time more active. In addition, it's emphasized that physical activity can be used to add meaning to life.The Japanese guidelines stress the importance of giving meaning to everything you do (like being mindful while you eat). In regards to physical activity, it's recommended to choose exercises that enhance self-satisfaction and support social interactions.
This type of focus on activity can help making exercising more fun and enjoyable. If you're actually enjoying your exercise, you're more likely to stick with your routine.
The Japanese guidelines give examples of such activities and they include: shopping with a family member or friend, gardening with a family member, walking together, playing a sport or dancing.

Take your dog to see a veterinarian if you notice any symptoms.,
Allow the veterinarian to perform a full blood panel.,
Request a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.,
Ask about checking your dog’s urine under a microscope.,
Be aware that your dog may need to be isolated.,
Administer antibiotics.,
Get your dog treated for complications of leptospirosis.",How to Diagnose Canine Leptospirosis2," If you think that your dog may have leptospirosis, then take him to see a veterinarian right away. Tell the veterinarian about your suspicions as well so that the veterinarian and veterinary technicians can protect themselves.Avoid contact with the dog’s urine as well and wash your hands after having any contact with the dog (petting, holding, etc.).

, The vet may want to run a blood panel to confirm a diagnosis of leptospirosis and also to look at your dog's liver and kidney function. If a blood test is negative and leptospirosis is still suspected, then the vet may need to repeat the test in two weeks to see if there is an increase in the antibodies. This may indicate the dog’s body is trying to fight off the disease., Another way to confirm leptospirosis is for the veterinarian to run a PCR on your dog’s blood or urine. This test can also confirm a diagnosis of leptospirosis, but it may take a while longer because samples often have to be sent to a lab., A third option is to examine a urine sample under a low-light microscope. Inspecting the urine this way may allow the lab technician to see the spiral shaped leptospira and give a positive diagnosis. However, this method is not as accurate or as safe as the other methods of checking for leptospirosis., If you or your veterinarian suspect leptospirosis, then the veterinarian will need to isolate your dog. This is due to the danger that the disease poses to other animals and humans. The veterinarian and veterinary staff will also need to wear protective clothing when caring for your dog., A round of antibiotics are the most common treatment for canine leptospirosis. Your dog’s veterinarian will most likely administer antibiotics even if a diagnosis of leptospirosis is not yet confirmed. Your dog will need to be on antibiotics for two weeks.Doxycycline is often administered to dogs with leptospirosis, but penicillin may also be given at first if the dog does not tolerate doxycycline well. However, the dog will need a full two week dose of doxycycline to recover.In some cases, a dog may need to be kept at the veterinary clinic for treatment and monitoring, so you may not need to worry about administering the antibiotics yourself. But if you are allowed to take your dog home, then make sure that you administer the antibiotics exactly as your veterinarian has instructed. Do not stop giving them until the medicine is gone and your veterinarian has said it is okay to stop.

, Kidney and liver failure are possible complications of leptospirosis and these conditions may require treatment as well. To treat complications of leptospirosis, your dog's veterinarian may:Balance your dog’s fluids to regain normal electrolyte balance.
Give your dog medicine to stop him from vomiting.
Administer medications to help support your dog’s liver.
Perform hemodialysis if your dog’s kidneys have failed.

Try curtsy lunges.,
Do a traditional squat.",How to Grow Hips With Exercise1," Lay on your side on a mat, with your knees bent slightly and one leg stacked evenly on top of the other. Your hips should be at a 90 degree angle to the ground, not angled towards the front or the back. Bend your lower leg a little more to give yourself balance and support, and straighten your top leg with your foot flexed. Raise your top leg upward (while keeping your foot flexed) and slightly backwards, then lower it again.Lift and lower your upper leg in sets of 5 or 10, depending on how advanced you are in your workout, then switch and repeat the same exercises on your other side.;
, This exercise is similar to the side-lying hip abduction, but your knees will be bent. Lie on your side as you did with the side-lying hip abduction. Instead of keeping your legs straight, bend them and stack one on top of the other. Then, slide your knees forward so you are lying in a loose fetal position. Your feet should be aligned with your hips and your knees should be out in front of your body.

When you are in position, slowly begin to lift up your top knee, as if it is the top of a clamshell. As you do this, keep your top foot on top of your lower foot as if they are connected.Then, slowly lower the top leg back down until it is resting on the bottom leg.
Do this exercise for about one minute.
Repeat this exercise on the opposite side after you finish the first side.
Do up to three sets on each side.

, Stand up straight, put your hands on your hips, and keep your abdomen tight. Raise your right knee upwards and move your right foot sideways until your left leg is stretched nicely. Place your right foot on the ground, bend you right knee a little more, and keep your left leg straight. Your left foot should still be flat on the ground. Then push yourself off the ground with your right foot and propel yourself back to a standing position. Repeat the same action on your left side.You can do all of one side, then move to the other side, or you can alter sides for each lunge.
Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise on each side, depending on how advanced you are in your workout.
An alternative to this side lunge is to NOT place your foot on the ground when you return to a standing position. But rather to keep your knee bent, and your foot raised up off the ground. This adds a little more complexity and resistance to the exercise.

, This exercise is still a side lunge, except that you’re not moving your feet when you move your body. Instead, start by standing up straight with your feet 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart. Then lunge to the right side by bending your right knee and straightening your left leg. Then straighten yourself back upwards, without moving your feet. Keep your back straight and as upright as possible, keep your head up, and make sure that you knees never extend past your toes on the bent leg. Do the same type of lunge on your left side. This version can put less stress on your knees and adds more resistance to the muscles you’re trying to build.Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise on each side, depending on how advanced you are in your workout.

, A curtsy lunge is also a great way to work your outer hip muscles. To do a curtsy lunge, stand with your feet shoulder width apart and take a big step back and across the opposite leg. As you do this, bend your knees and hold your balance in the position for a moment. Then, slowly begin to stand up and return your back foot to its starting position.Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times on both sides. Do three sets.
You can also hold weights in your hands to make this exercise a little harder.

, Stand up straight and place your feet so they are about shoulder width apart. Keep your abdomen tight and your back straight. Lower your bum towards the floor like you’re going to sit down, but stop when your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then raise yourself back up to the standing position (don’t move your feet). Repeat this movement 5 to 10 times, depending on how advanced you are in your workout.To add more resistance to this exercise, you can hold dumbbells in both your hands while you squat. The weight of the dumbbells is up to you - whatever you’re most comfortable with at the time.

Perform the standing side abduction.,
Try the Monster or Sumo walk.,
Walk sideways on a treadmill.,
Do some kettlebell swings.",How to Grow Hips With Exercise2," The standing side abduction is the same as the side-lying hip abduction, except that you’re standing upright and adding some resistance to the movement of your outside leg. While standing, hold onto a wall, railing or stable chair with your right hand. Place a dumbbell into your left hand and hold it against your left thigh. Flex your left foot and lift it outwards from the wall, then bring it back down towards the wall again. Keep your back straight.Perform 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise, depending on how advanced you are in your workout. Once you’ve completed all repetitions on one side, switch and do the other side.
The weight of the dumbbell will depend on what is comfortable for you at the moment. Start with a light weight dumbbell and increase the weight as you perform the exercise over time.
An alternative to a dumbbell is to use a resistance band, which is essentially a large elastic band specifically designed for exercise purposes. To use the resistance band, you’ll need a chair or an exercise machine with an anchor point near the floor to attach the band to (that’s steady and won’t move as you pull against the band). Place one end of the band around the steady object and the other band around your left ankle. When you pull your left leg outwards, the band will act as resistance to the movement.

, This exercise requires a resistance band that is short enough to go around your legs and provide resistance as your widen your stance. You can place the band around your legs at knee level (slightly above your actual knee joints), at ankle level, or around the balls of your feet - whichever location is most comfortable for you at the time. Once the band is in place, widen your stance until there is a decent amount of resistance on the band. Then slightly bend your knees and have your arms out in front of you.For the Monster walk, keep the band stretched and walk forwards and backwards, stepping one foot in front of the other.
For the Sumo walk, keep the band stretched and shimmy to the left and the right.
Perform 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise (in either direction), depending on how advanced you are in your workout.

, For this exercise you’ll want to set the treadmill at a 3 to 5% incline, and at a speed of 2 to 3 mph (3.2 to 4.8 km/h) (very slow). Start the treadmill while standing on the side panel (the part that doesn’t move). If your right side is facing the front of the treadmill, place your right hand on the front bar for support, and your left hand on the left-side bar for support. Step onto the tread and start walking sideways. Again, if your right side is facing the front of the treadmill, you’ll want to step ‘forward’ by crossing your left foot over your right foot.Perform this exercise for 5 to 10 minutes on either side, with 30 second breaks every minute or so.
Start this exercise at a very, very slow speed until you get use to the motion. Once you’re more comfortable, you can increase the speed. However, note that the speed isn’t the key to this exercise, it’s the movement. So continuing at a slow speed will be just as effective.

, If you have a pair of kettlebells or have access to some at your gym, then you can use them to help you build your hip muscles. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart, bend forward at your hips, and grasp a kettlebell by the handle with both hands.Keeping your arms and back straight, lift the kettlebell up, out and away from your body in front of you as you straighten your knees and hips. The kettlebell should swing out as you do this.
Then, flowing with the movement of the kettlebell, bend at your hips and knees again and bring the kettlebell back down to the ground.
Repeat this movement 10 to 15 times and do three sets.

Perform some hip-opening yoga poses.,
Stretch your hip muscles.,
Eat more protein and carbs.,
Hire a personal trainer.",How to Grow Hips With Exercise3," Hip-opening yoga poses are those that specifically focus on stretching tight hip muscles. Technically, all yoga poses can be considered hip-opening poses because yoga in general is designed to help your hip muscles. But there are some very specific poses that target this area and also help improve your range of motion, blood circulation and reduce back pain. Exercises focused specifically on the hip muscles will probably make them sore and stiff, these yoga poses will help release that stiffness.The following poses are recommended to help stretch your hip muscles:

The happy baby pose.The reclining bound angle pose.The frog pose.The ‘thread the needle’ pose.The half pigeon and double pigeon poses.The camel pose.The hero pose., You hip joint is a very stable joint with lots of muscles and a large range of motion. Activities where you aren’t using your hips muscles in the way they were designed to be used (i.e. sitting at a desk all day) can cause them to tighten up and be painful. Stretching your hip muscles is a great way to loosen up this whole area, maintain good posture, and keep your spine aligned properly.There are several hip stretches you can perform to help loosen the whole area:

The hip flexor stretch.
The hip rotator stretch.
The hip adductor stretch.
The hip extensor stretch.
The standing hamstring stretch.
The iliotibial band stretch.



, Ideally, your hips will become bigger via an increase in the muscles in that area. The muscles will increase because of the exercises you’ll do to target that area. To get the energy to keep up your exercise routine, and to keep exercising long-term, you need to consume carbs. You also need to consume protein that will help build that muscle.The average person should eat a decent meal 1-2 hours before they exercise, and have another decent meal 1-2 hours after they exercise. As long as the meals are balanced and nutritious, they will provide the carbs and protein you need to have energy and build muscle.An example of a pre or post workout meal for a women might be: a small handful of almonds, a deck of cards size of meat, a handful of vegetables, and a handful of rice or other grain. An example of a man’s meal would generally be larger, depending on his weight and height, but up to double what is recommended for women.
You should also be sure to consume water throughout and after your workout in order to stay properly hydrated.

, If you’re really serious about increasing your hip size, and you have sufficient funds, you may want to consider hiring a personal trainer.


Most personal trainers will have been certified by one of many certifying bodies (such as the American Council on Exercise (ACE), the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA), and others).Most personal trainers work through health centres and local gyms, which means you will also require a membership to whatever place your personal trainer works from.Many cities offer personal training options through their city-wide recreational programs and centres."

Eat right.,
Include lean protein in your diet.,
Get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D helps you grow stronger bones and promotes muscle growth in children.A deficiency of vitamin D has been linked to stunted growth and even weight gain in teenage girls, a recent study has found.,
Put zinc into your body.,
Get plenty of calcium.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Consider taking vitamin supplements.,
Be wary of miracle cure products.",How to Get Taller Fast1," A balanced diet filled with plenty of healthy nutrients will help you to grow strong and healthy and reach your full height. That means staying away from the cakes, sodas, and pizzas and reaching for the salads, whole grains, and fish. If you're having trouble motivating yourself to eat these foods, search for different recipes and look for combinations of food that you find appealing.


To get a clear view of what equals a healthy balanced diet that includes protein, fruit, vegetables, grains and dairy, look at the USDA MyPlate website.;
, Proteins are the building blocks for the things that help you grow tall and strong, your bones, muscles and cartilage.So eating a good amount of foods from the protein foods group is important if you want to maximize your potential height. The recommended amount varies by age, gender and how much exercise you get.


Girls aged 9-18 are recommended the equivalent of 5 ounces daily.
Boys aged 9-13 are recommended the equivalent of 5 ounces daily.
Boys aged 14-18 are recommended 6.5 equivalent ounces daily.Protein foods include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, and seeds.

,


Foods rich in vitamin D include oily fish, mushrooms, and fortified cereals., Although the studies are far from conclusive, the scientific evidence may point to a possible connection between zinc deficiencies and stunted growth.That means get your zinc or risk the possibility of stunting your growth. Some foods that are good sources of zinc include:


Seafood, especially shellfish.
Lamb.
Spinach., Again, there is little direct evidence between calcium and getting taller, but calcium is an essential ingredient in helping you grow strong bones which are important for growth.. Most of your calcium will come from dairy products. It is recommended that boys and girls aged 9-18 should consume the equivalent of three cups of calcium-rich dairy foods a day.Dairy products that are high in fat are not recommended.
Cream, cream cheese, and butter are dairy foods that have little calcium.
Alternatives to dairy products for your calcium include tinned fish, leafy greens, soy products, and calcium-fortified juices, cereals and bread., As well as avoiding too much fatty and salty food, there are reports that some generally healthy foods might have a negative impact on your height. You should have a balanced diet, and these are not hard facts, but consider lowering your intake of soy products, tomatoes, and broad beans.It is more important to have a healthy and balanced diet than not eating these three things.

, You can top your intake with basic multivitamins you can buy at the store. You could also focus in on vitamin D and zinc by purchasing vitamin tablets just for these two important elements. Cod liver oil tablets are also easy to find and are an excellent source of vitamin D and great for your bones and joints.Other more concentrated and potentially harmful supplements, including Ipriforne and Glucosamine, are reported to promote growth..
Before considering one of these supplements always talk to your Doctor.

, You may come across some supplements that claim to be able to make you taller miraculously. Remember, if your plates have fused you are not going to gain inches. Some products may claim to be or contain human growth hormone (HGH) which stimulates growth. You should be very careful with this, as HGH cannot be taken as a pill and it should only ever be administered by a doctor."

Decrease your daily calorie intake.,
Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.,
Switch to healthier carbohydrates.,
Eat lean protein.,
Stay hydrated.,
Perform cardiovascular exercises.,
Do two days of strength training.,
Avoid neck toning exercises.,
Always wear sunscreen.,
Use retinol creams.,
Consider surgical treatment.",How to Get Rid of Neck Fat," No matter where you want to lose weight, you'll need to decrease your overall weight. Decreasing your total daily calories will help you do that.


Decrease your total daily caloric intake by about 500 calories daily. This will generally result in about 1 pound of weight loss per week.Cutting out too many calories may result in slower weight loss and nutrition deficiencies since you're not able to eat the recommended amount of essential nutrients you need daily.It's helpful to use a food journal or journaling app to help you count how many calories you currently eat daily. Then subtract 500 calories to find a total to shoot for daily to help you lose weight.;
, Both fruits and vegetables are very low calorie and very high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. Making half your meals and snacks a fruit or vegetable can easily help you cut down on overall calorie intake.


It's typically recommended to consume about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.One serving of fruit is about 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece.One serving of vegetables is 1 cup cooked veggies, or 2 cups of salad., Whole grains (grains that contain the bran, germ and endosperm) contain more fiber and other essential nutrients than refined grains. When you choose to eat a grain-based food, choose 100% whole grain.Choose whole grain foods like: 100% whole wheat pasta, 100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole grain oats, quinoa or barley.
Refined carbohydrates (foods made with white flour or overly processed) offer very little in the way of nutritional benefits.
Fiber also slows the digestive process, making you feel full for a longer period of time and giving your body a longer period of time to absorb nutrients.

, Lean protein is essential to all diets, but even more important for a weight loss diet. The amount of protein you need depends on a number of factors, including your activity level and weight.


Lean protein has been shown to keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to other nutrients like carbohydrates.
Include a 3 – 4 oz serving of protein at each meal or snack. This serving size is similar to the size of an adult palm or a deck of cards.Foods to try include: low-fat dairy, seafood, lean beef, poultry, eggs, legumes and tofu.

, Water is essential in keeping your bodily functions running properly.Moreover, hydrated skin is far less likely to sag or appear loose.


Aim to consume least eight 8-oz glasses (about 2 liters) of hydrating fluids daily. Some people may need up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily. This will depend on your weight, gender and activity level.Water also helps control your appetite. Thirst and dehydration can feel and seem like hunger, which could trigger you to eat when all you really need is a glass of water.
Opt for water and unsweetened beverages over sugary drinks like juice, sweetened coffee drinks, and soda. Sweetened drinks are high in empty calories.

, Aerobic or cardio exercise will help burn calories and support your weight loss.


The CDC recommends that adults perform about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio each week.You could do 30 minutes of cardio five days of week to meet this minimum goal.
Try a variety of exercises like: walking, jogging/running, biking, using the elliptical, swimming or dancing.
In addition to helping support weight loss or a healthy weight, cardiovascular activities have also been shown to help manage diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol levels., In addition to cardiovascular exercise, you should also include a few days of strength or resistance training.


The CDC recommends two days of strength training for at least 20 minutes a session. It's also recommended to do a variety of exercises so that you will work each major muscle group (legs, chest, core, arms, etc).There are a variety of activities that can count as strength training including: lifting free weights, using weight machines, yoga and pilates.

, There are a variety of exercises that have been promoted to help get rid of neck fat; however, most have the opposite effect.


Although you might think that working or strengthening the muscles around your neck could help get rid of fat, these exercises may only bulk up your neck muscles. Bulky muscles will make your neck look thicker, not smaller.
In general, when you lose weight, you will notice a decrease in the amount of fat that you carry around your neck.

, In addition to diet and exercise, wearing regular sunscreen can help slow the look of wrinkled, sagging, aged skin.If you have sun damaged skin that is wrinkled and looks more aged, this can worsen the look of the excess fat stored around your neck.
It's recommended to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 30 SPF year-round for both men and women. You may need higher SPF if you're in direct sunlight for longer periods of time. Reapply every two hours and wear a broad-rimmed hat for extra coverage., There are a variety of retinoid-based wrinkle creams available over-the-counter and also by prescription. Some of these creams will help build collagen and smooth wrinkles.Used in combination with sunscreen, moisturizers, diet and exercise, these creams can help reduce the look of sagging, wrinkled neck skin.
Procedures and creams used in a dermatology office are considered the best or gold standard and generally receive the best results., If you've tried diet, exercise and skin creams, you may want to consider a more drastic measure to remove excess fat or skin around your neck.


There are a variety of treatment options available including: liposuction, botox, laser treatments and neck lifts.Make a consultation with a dermatologist to get an idea of what would be best for your body and budget (as some of these treatments can be costly).

Get more sleep.,
Exercise.,
Try stretching.,
Wait to grow naturally over time.",How to Get Taller Fast2," Did you know you only grow when you're asleep? Your body produces human growth hormone (HGH) while you sleep. This hormone helps you develop muscle and actually grow taller. So if you're serious about getting taller, get plenty of sleep.


School-age children should get between 10 and 11 hours of sleep.Teens and those just under 18 should get at least 9 to 10 hours of sleep.

, Whatever you do, take the time to exercise. Exercise is crucial for your healthy development and general well-being. If you want to grow tall during your teen years especially, get in the habit of exercising your body. All exercise is good, and there is no particular exercise to increase height, but doing things that involve stretching and jumping will help to lengthen your spine.


Try jumping around by playing basketball or skipping.
Try stretching out your back and limbs by swimming.
There is no specific amount of time you should be doing this for to increase height, but the more the better.
It is recommended that people children and adolescents should do an hour of exercise a day to be healthy.To give yourself the best chance of growing taller, try to exceed this amount.

, Some stretches can help you to release your spine and improve your posture. If you stretch the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night, it can help you to become more upright, and thus make the most of your height. Some of the stretches to try include:


Toe touches. Stand up straight and raise your hands up to the sky, and then reach down to touch your toes.
Cobra stretch. Lie on your front with your hands at your sides and then push up on your hands to raise your chest and tilt back your head.
Bridge stretch. Lie on your back with your hands at either side of you, then, pressing down on your hands, raise your abdomen off the ground to stretch your back.

, If you do all of the previous steps, there's a good chance that you've given your body the best chance to grow taller. Not everyone is going to be as tall as a basketball player or a model. Being tall isn't everything, so learn to be comfortable with how you are.


Some people are ""late bloomers"" and only hit their big growth spurt when they turn 17, 18 or beyond.
If you are really concerned, see your pediatric endocrinologist. This doctor will be able to give you valuable information about possible medical courses you may take in order to combat low growth.

Adjust your posture.,
Go for medium or short hair.,
Streamline your look.,
Wear slimming colors, and vertical patterns.,
Wear heels or platforms.",How to Get Taller Fast3," If you've done all you can to help yourself grow taller, there are still a few things that can help you to make the most of your height. You may not realize just how much bad posture can affect your overall height. A slight slumping of the shoulders, leaning forward of the head and neck, and habitually standing with your weight on one leg can all subtract from your height.Walk with a book on your head to train your body to keep your spine as erect as possible.
Stand with your legs straight, and no further than hip width apart. Stick your chin up a little. Not only will it add some extra height, but it'll also make you look more confident.
Get into the habit of sitting up straight and concentrate on contracting your abdomen muscles to help.

, You may think that longer hair would make you look taller. But in fact, longer hair takes attention away from your neck and neckline, making you appear smaller. Instead, opt for short or medium length hair. These hairstyles will put the emphasis back on your neck.If you have a fairly tall neck, these hairstyles will look great.

, Wearing tight-fitting clothing, such as skinny jeans, helps to accentuate the lines of your form. When you wear baggy clothing, those lines aren't really defined, making you appear more squat. Skinny jeans, especially, will define your leg length and will cling on nicely to your leg shape, attracting attention to your leg shape rather than your height.


For girls, wearing a slim skirt will help you accentuate the natural length of your legs., Slimming colors such as black, navy blue, and forest green will help you appear taller. These colors make your body appear slimmer and works for boys and girls. Going for slimming top and slimming bottom gets you double the effect. Likewise, wearing clothes with vertical lines help accentuate height.


For women, try out a pair of vertically striped pants, or maybe even a collared shirt.For men, a shirt that has narrow vertical stripes, rather than checks, can help.Both genders should avoid the horizontally striped tees — these have the opposite effect of making you appear squatter.

, This isn't for everyone of course, but wearing heels or platform shoes is an instant boost. You can grow anywhere from a couple of inches to six inches as soon as you put them on. With a pair of heels on, people will look at you or up to you instead of down to you. When you first meet a person, their first impression won't be of your height, but rather of your facial features.


Walking in high heels is a serious skill that takes practice. Take the time to really feel comfortable in high heels before you wear them outside.
Walking in high heels can damage your feet. Try to wear insoles and moleskin, as well as breaking new shoes in before going out in them.
If you don't want to wear obviously big heels, look for shoes with thick soles.
Men can buy heel inserts to boost their height."

Stay away from anything that tastes overly sweet, that contains honey or molasses, or that lists sugar in the ingredients. This can be a big challenge for people. Exchange your current dessert option for a lower-sugar fruit, or start by decreasing your portions of sweets.;
, Sugar is also found in less obvious places like fruit and dairy.Avoid milk sugars by replacing cow’s milk with unsweetened soy or almond milk.

, A healthy diet should include fresh fruits, so don’t fully avoid eating fruit. Choose fruits that are lower in fructose (fruit sugar) than others, such as blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and citrus. Stay away from fruit juice and dried fruit.

, Stop drinking alcohol altogether or drink it only in very small amounts, such as one serving (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) a week. Alcohol contains a lot of sugar.If you’ve been drinking and feel like you need help to quit, talk to your doctor.

Listen to your body's hunger signals.,
Make food delicious.,
Eat mindfully.,
Run around!,
Focus on enjoying your health, rather than forcing it.",How to Have a Healthy Lifestyle Without Dieting," If you are hungry, eat! Think about what you are hungry for. You may need protein, simple carbs, complex carbs, vegetables, dessert, or something else entirely.


Get in touch with how you feel after you eat different things. If you eat nothing but chocolate cake, you may not feel wonderful. However, after a full meal with protein and complex carbs and vegetables, that slice of cake might make you feel great.
Stop labeling foods as good or bad: food is meant to nourish us, and cake can do that! Sometimes whole wheat toast might make you feel better than white, sometimes the other way around. You may have a craving for spinach. It's possible. Your body knows what it's hungry for, and it's right.;
, Here's a secret: spinach and carrots and broccoli can all be delicious. Get fresh produce, from the Farmer's Market or the grocery store, and be amazed at how good it can be than the frozen or old stuff.


For example: pick up some fresh spinach, and sauté it in fresh crushed garlic and olive oil. Carrots can be nice plain, but try roasting them in olive oil for a concentrated, caramelized sweetness. Asparagus is also great roasted.
For some lovely broccoli florets, steam them partially in the microwave, and then sauté them with butter, garlic, and a bit of lemon. If you are used to plain, steamed broccoli from the freezer aisle, you may be surprised how delicious it can be when properly prepared. Plus, adding in fresh, tasty veggies to your diet may make you feel good, too! If you want to start somewhere simple, try a Caesar salad.

, Give your food your full attention. When eating, say, a slice of chocolate cake, (chocolate cake is good) try putting a small bite in your mouth. Really focus on the taste and the texture.


You may find that a small bite has a ton of flavor, and realize that eating everything that way would be one giant culinary adventure. A warning, though: don't do this to the point of annoyance. Don't force yourself to inspect every crumb if you don't want to. This should be something you enjoy, not torture as you stare at a plate of food.

, Forget the gym. Does anybody actually find the gym fun? Exercise should make us feel good, from the release of endorphins and using our muscles. There isn't much fun in running in place for an hour, at least not for most people.


Find a type of exercise that you enjoy. If you live somewhere nice, try hiking. You may start walking on the beach and find it hard to stop. Join a soccer team, or ultimate frisbee, or take tennis lessons.
Dance alone at home to your favorite song. Go rock climbing. You may find it more fun to do whatever it is outside. Do whatever gets your blood pumping, and you'll feel great for it.

, Even if you don't drink 12 glasses of water a day, you are still most likely in good health. Many people would love to be so lucky! So have fun!

Use an app such as MyFitness pro on a device you carry around with you all the time.,
Exercise.","How to Go on a Diet Successfully, Start Fresh, and Be More Productive2"," For instance, you should eat fruit in the morning, carbs at noon and protein at dinner. This is because digesting fruit is very quick whilst protein takes a long time.

, And between each meal drink as much water as possible. Drinking water not only helps fill your stomach up a little, but it gets your metabolism working. Drink cold water too. When you drink cold water, your body must heat it up. This burns calories and trains your metabolism to be faster.

, And don't lie to yourself on the application. You are trying to improve, not lie to a machine. Make sure you enter whatever you eat, as you will feel more guilty about eating the snack and it will help you to stop snacking unhealthy foods.

, Whenever you have the opportunity, do some workout sessions. Even if you can only do 5 minutes a day. It is better than 0 minutes a day. DO different types of exercise, like walking or cycling to work or school. Play tennis with friends. Anything that gets you moving.

, A simple trim or change of look will make a huge difference.  If you wear glasses and hate them, consider contact lenses. If you like wearing glasses, but hate how they look, try on every set of frames in the shop.  . Get a haircut if you are sick with your hair. Make sure you get a style that suits your face shape and hair type. Discuss it with your hairdresser beforehand. Invest in a straightener if you want sleek straight hair.

, So clean out the clutter in your office to get more done.

Do things at off-peak hours and you’ll save so many of them. Get things right the first time. Most people are wildly distracted these days. And so they make mistakes. To unleash your productivity, become one of the special performers who have the mindset of doing what it takes to get it flawless first. This saves you days of having to fix problems.

, Turn off your emails on your phone. Use a simple to-do-list like TeuxDeux  and only put THREE things on it to get done each day. Plan your day according to the most important, biggest task, not the smallest and easiest.

Surround your brain with a healthy body.,
Provide a steady supply of glucose with smart carb choices.,
Increase your DHA intake.,
Try other brain-boosters.",How to Improve Creativity Through Diet1," Your brain is the source of your creativity, and it does not exist in isolation from the rest of your body. If you improve your overall health by making good food choices, you will improve your brain health, and in turn your brain function, and in turn your creative capacity. It’s as simple as that.


The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans was recently released online at http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/, and it is a good starting point for making healthier food choices. It emphasizes shifting your current “eating pattern,” and offers specific target food choices based on age, sex, and activity level, as well as sample U.S.-style, Mediterranean-style, and vegetarian-style eating patterns for inspiration. The general recommendations include:

Eating more vegetables and whole fruits, and choosing from a range of colors and varieties.
Making whole grains at least fifty percent of your grain intake.
Focusing on low-fat, nutrient-dense dairy products, like low-fat yogurt.
Choosing nutrient-dense, lean proteins, like fish, poultry, eggs, legumes, soy, and nuts.
Cutting back on your intake of added sugars, saturated fat, processed meats, and sodium.

;
, It turns out that there is a valid reason why it is hard to think clearly on an empty stomach. Most of the food we consume is converted to glucose, which is essentially the fuel for our bodies, including our brains. Maintaining a steady, sufficient supply of glucose gives your brain the energy it needs to be at its creative best.Simple carbohydrates, like those found in sugary drinks and refined grains like white bread and pasta, will give a quick spike in glucose levels, but this quickly dissipates into a crash. This up-and-down pattern is not conducive to sustained, focused brain activity.
Alternatively, eating more frequent, smaller meals and snacks consisting of fruits and vegetables and other foods with complex carbohydrates will give you a steady supply of glucose without the spikes and crashes. Choose foods like almonds, whole wheat, oatmeal, lentils, and beans., By this point, you have probably heard about the many health benefits of consuming foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids, as found in seafood and a range of other sources. DHA is a particularly beneficial component of the omega-3 group when it comes to brain health. DHA can help strengthen your brain’s electrical transmissions, which are essential to all functions, including the production of dopamine — which in turn spurs your cognitive control and creativity.Many types of fish and other seafood like squid contain high levels of DHA. You can also consider fish oil supplements or edible algae, seaweed, or kelp. Other omega-3 rich foods like walnuts and flaxseeds do not contain DHA, but are good for your overall health (including brain health) regardless. See this WikiHow article on omega-3 foods for more information.

, In addition to increasing your omega-3 intake and reducing your saturated fat intake, which are healthy choices for your entire body and have brain benefits as well, you can try increasing your consumption of other compounds and nutrients that seem to help the brain. While they can’t specifically claim to boost creativity, they, like other healthy body / brain food choices, should help create conditions more conducive to creative thought.The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables (especially colorful ones like peppers and berries) offer many health benefits, including improving your memory and mood.
Green tea contains the antioxidant known as polyphenol, which helps to eliminate the free radicals in your body that can destroy brain cells.
While excess alcohol consumption can destroy brain cells, drinking 1-2 glasses of red wine per day provides you with the flavonoid called resveratrol, which boosts blood flow to the brain and may even reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Make a list of foods that are dairy-based.,
Go shopping for alternatives.,
Give up dairy products by group.,
Cook for yourself.,
Dine out wisely.,
Reward yourself occasionally.,
Ask for support.,
Grab a hearty breakfast.,
Fuel up with a delicious lunch.,
Enjoy a savory dinner.,
Delight in a dairy-free dessert.,
Observe symptoms of lactose intolerance.,
Get enough calcium through non-dairy foods.,
See your doctor.",How to Give Up Dairy Products," Figure out which foods you like are dairy-based or have dairy. You can do this by reading the ingredients on product labeling, which often says, “Contains milk.” This can familiarize you with exactly what is in your food. It can also help you gradually remove it from your diet and give it up entirely. Common foods that are dairy-based or contain dairy include:Frozen desserts
Frozen meals
Cow’s milk
Mayonnaise
Dressings and dips
Whipped and ice creams
Fresh and frozen yogurt and kefir
Pudding
Cheese
Quark and sour cream
Butter;
, There are dairy-free options that can replace most foods. Foods marked “vegan” are dairy-free. Reading product ingredient labels for “contains dairy” can alert you to foods containing milk to milk-based products. Many non-dairy versions of products, such as shredded cheese, yogurt, and coffee creamers, are made from the following types of non-dairy milk:Soy
Rice
Hemp
Flax
Coconut
Almond

, Giving up dairy cold turkey may cause cravings and take you off track. Start with the groups of dairy you like least, such as milk or coffee creamer. Work up to the dairy group you love most, such as yogurt or cheese. Getting rid of certain dairy products a bit at a time can help you give it up while minimizing cravings and helping you stick to your goal.Add a new group of swaps after a couple of weeks or when you feel comfortable using the alternative. Keep going until you’re dairy free.

, Plan and make your own meals each week. This can minimize the risk of eating or drinking any dairy products. It can also help you figure out what to eat if you’re having dinner at a restaurant or another person’s home.Examples of dairy-free meals include:


Pasta with marinara sauce and steamed vegetables
Salmon sautéed in olive oil with a baked potato and nutritional yeast for flavor

, Dairy can pop up in a lot of sneaky places. This is especially true in restaurants. Check online menus for dairy-free options if you are going out. You can also ask your server or a manager if certain dishes contain any dairy or if they have been cooked with butter. Some restaurant foods that often contain or are cooked in dairy include:Creamy soups such as chowders and bisques
Oatmeal
Thick dressings including ranch and thousand island
Omelets
Sautéed vegetables
Smoothies, including those with whey powder
Sherbet

, Eating dairy-free doesn’t mean you have to give up delicious and decadent foods. Making yourself dairy-free treats once or twice each week can keep you excited about your diet and satisfy your taste buds. They can also keep you on track. Some easy, dairy-free ways to indulge include:Vegan ice cream
Vegan fudge
Vegan pizza
Vegan cake

, Let your friends and family know you’re going dairy-free. Ask them to enjoy dairy-meals with you or share in your journey. Having support from loved ones can help you stay on your dairy-free diet., It’s easy to have a non-dairy breakfast that satisfies you and helps get your day off to a good start. The following are some delicious, non-dairy breakfast options:Cereal with coconut milk and a cup of coffee with soy creamer
Almond milk yogurt with berries
Toast with cashew butter and a cup of coffee with almond milk
Smoothie made with hemp protein powder and coconut milkAlmond milk pancakes or muffins

, Your midday meal can give you fuel to get through a big part of your day. Some examples of satisfying, non-dairy dishes for lunch include:Baked potato with avocado or tahini
Tomato soup thickened with ground cashews
Sandwich with hummus or nut butter

, Wind down your day with a rich and savory dinner. Some easy non-dairy evening meals include:Pizza with homemade crust, veggies, and shredded soy cheese
Burritos or tacos with guacamole and salsa
Burger with a slice of avocado

, Many people associate dessert with creamy dishes including ice cream and pies with whipped topping. You can easily get the same delight from a dessert even without dairy. The following may satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilt of dairy:Nut milk ice cream
Frozen banana “ice cream”
Baked goods with coconut oil instead of butter
Sorbet

, Some people are not able to fully digest the lactose, or sugar, in milk. This can lead to uncomfortable symptoms and even malabsorption of calcium.Most symptoms of lactose intolerance occur 30 minutes to two hours after consuming dairy-based foods and beverages. These may include:Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal cramps
Bloating
Gas

, Lactose intolerance and not consuming dairy can lead to a calcium deficiency. Incorporating alternative foods and beverages high in calcium can prevent a calcium deficiency. Non-dairy foods and beverages high in calcium include:Collard greens
Broccoli
Kale
Bok choy
Edamame
Figs
Oranges
Sardines
White beans
Tofu
Canned salmon
Okra
Almonds

, Make an appointment with your doctor if suspect that you are lactose intolerant or worry about not getting enough calcium in your diet. Your doctor can run tests to diagnose lactose intolerance or a calcium deficiency. They can also form a treatment plan for you if you have either condition and want to get enough calcium without dairy.Let your doctor know what your symptoms are, when they started, or when you gave up dairy products.

Eat fewer starches.,
Eat non-tuber vegetables.,
Choose non-starchy fiber sources.",How to Give Up Carbs2," Bread and pasta are starches that are high in complex carbohydrates.Complex carbs are better for you than sugary simple carbs, but you can still minimize them in your diet. Decrease your portion sizes of bread, pasta, rice, and grains. This includes whole grain products.Replace these in your diet with foods that are lower in starch, such as lentils and vegetables.

, Most vegetables are a healthy part of a balanced diet, but tuber vegetables contain a lot of starch and should be avoided if you want to give up carbs. Stay away from veggies that grow underground, such as:


Potatoes
Carrots
Radishes
Beets
Parsnips
Turnips

, Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that helps your digestive tract stay healthy. Don’t cut fiber from your diet, but do opt for less starchy sources of fiber. For example, you should only have small portions of beans or lentils and eat minimal wholegrain breads and pastas.However, you should eat plenty of non-starchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, zucchini, peppers, and eggplant.


Nuts are also a good source of fiber.
Keep in mind that men need 38 g of fiber per day and women need 25 g of fiber per day."
"
Talk to your doctor before changing your diet.,
Work with a dietitian.,
Check labels.,
Eat at least 20 grams of carbs a day.,
Wean off of carbs slowly.,
Make sure you get enough calcium in your diet.,
Manage your portion sizes.,
Handle your carb cravings.",How to Give Up Carbs3," If you’re planning on drastically changing how you eat, talk to your doctor about it first. Schedule a visit for a physical exam, and tell them you want to eat fewer carbohydrates in your diet. They will ask you about your family history, any medical problems you have, and what medications you take.


Ask if there’s anything you need to avoid in order to stay safe. Say something like, “Is there anything I should know about my diet, exercise, or medicine while I make this change?”

, Ask your doctor if you should see a dietician – if so, they can refer you to one. A dietitian can help you make meal plans, wean of off carbs slowly, and ensure that you get enough nutrients from the other foods that you eat. They may also tell you if giving up carbs is a bad idea for you based on your medical history.


Work with a licensed professional.

, Get into the habit of reading the nutritional information labels before you buy foods. This will tell you how many carbs are in the food and you can use this information to help you decide whether or not it is something you want to eat., A low-carb diet is appropriate for some, but no one should attempt a no-carb diet – your body needs some carbohydrates to function properly. Eat at least 20 grams of carbs every day so that your body doesn’t go into ketosis – a process that can cause nausea, headache, bad breath, and worse., Giving up all carbohydrates at once would be a big shock to your body and may cause some unpleasant side effects. Eliminate carbs slowly, starting with simple sugars. Then decrease the amounts of added sugars and processed starches you eat. This will also give you time to learn how to prepare low-carb meals.


Eliminating carbs too quickly can cause side effects like headache, bad breath, fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, or constipation., Dairy contains a lot of calcium that your body needs. Eat enough calcium in your diet with non-dairy alternatives like sesame seeds, chia seeds, sardines, canned salmon, beans, lentils, almonds, spinach, kale, rhubarb, and tofu., Fiber helps you feel full and not overeat. Avoid overeating when you decrease your fiber intake by controlling the size of your portions. Try keeping a food journal. Write down everything that you eat so you’re aware of your portions.

, You may have strong cravings for carbs, especially sugar. These will go away over time. Handle cravings by keeping non-carb snacks around such as nuts and seeds. It may help to gradually reduce your sugar intake – for instance, replace chocolate with bananas as a treat, then eventually stop eating bananas.

Do your homework on L-Tyrosine.,
Promote your “convergent” creativity.,
Select TYR-rich foods.,
Consider TYR supplements.",How to Improve Creativity Through Diet2," If you search the internet for foods that spur creativity, you will find many, many pieces of advice, much of which has no solid foundation in medical science. However, legitimate research indicates that foods and supplements containing L-Tyrosine (TYR) can actually help enhance certain types of creative thought.L-Tyrosine (TYR) is a biochemical precursor to dopamine, which fuels your brain’s creative impulses (among many other things). A European study published in 2014 indicated a correlation between taking TYR supplements and improvements in creative thinking.

, According to the 2014 research study, TYR consumption boosts so-called “convergent” creativity — what you might call “deep thinking.” This involves your ability to develop a single creative solution to a single problem. Convergent creativity requires mental speed, accuracy, and logic, all of which seemed to improve with TYR supplementation.TYR supplementation did not, however, show benefits in “divergent” creativity, better known as “brainstorming” — that is, your ability to rapidly formulate a wide range of solutions or creative concepts of varying quality. So, if you’re having trouble coming up with a topic for your research paper, grabbing a banana or other TYR-rich food may not do the trick alone, although it is likely to have general body and brain benefits.

, It turns out that Steve Jobs may have been on to something with his diet of apples and carrots. These are two of the many foods that are high in convergent creativity-boosting L-Tyrosine. Fruits are typically the best food source for TYR, and good options include bananas, peaches, and oranges, among others.You don’t have to eat only fruit to get your TYR fix, however. Foods such as almonds, fava beans, duck, chicken, ricotta cheese, oatmeal, mustard greens, edamame, dark chocolate, seaweed, and wheat germ also contain the compound., In the 2014 study, participants consumed their L-Tyrosine as a powdered supplement (or received a powdered placebo instead). There is no known advantage to consuming TYR in supplement form, and TYR-rich foods tend to provide a host of additional health benefits. However, supplements may be a way to further boost your intake.TYR supplements usually come in either 500 mg or 1000 mg doses. Be aware that TYR has a stimulant effect, however, so if you have a heart condition, high blood pressure, or are on MAOIs or other medications for cardiovascular issues, always consult your physician first. In fact, it is probably best to consult with your doctor before beginning a TYR supplement regimen regardless of your condition."

Be aware of the incubation period.,
Consider whether the person shows serious warning signs.,
Determine whether the patient has severe dengue.,
Visit the hospital for a checkup.,
Determine where treatment and care will occur.,
Maintain a clean and mosquito-free environment.,
Take dengue patients to the hospital daily.,
Ensure the patient gets sufficient bed rest.,
Give the patient Acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol®).,
Encourage the patient to drink a lot of fluids.,
Keep a daily record of symptoms.,
Take the patient to the hospital if her symptoms worsen.,
Deliver intravenous fluids.,
Do a blood transfusion.,
Administer corticosteroid injections.",How to Take Care of Dengue Patients," It takes about a week for symptoms to appear after an individual is infected. The symptoms presented by those infected with dengue determine its severity and the treatment plan.After you've been bitten by a dengue-infected mosquito, symptoms will appear typically four to seven days later. These symptoms generally last about three to ten days.;
, There are two major classifications of dengue: without and without warning signs.


Dengue without warning signs is usually identified by the presence of a fever (40 degrees Celsius/104 degrees Fahrenheit) and two or more of the following: nausea or vomiting; a rash that causes the face to redden and red patches to develop on arms, legs, chest, and back; body ache and pain; low white blood cell count; swelling of glands in the neck and behind the ear.Dengue with warning signs is classified similarly to dengue without warning signs, but patients in this category exhibited one or more of the following: abdominal pain; persistent vomiting; fluid accumulation in abdomen and lungs; bleeding from gums, eyes, nose; lethargy or restlessness; enlarged liver.Such warning signs indicate that the dengue infection may be serious and could progress to associated bleeding and organ failure, or what is called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). If one or more of the above symptoms are present, the subsequent 24-48 hours of dengue infection could be lethal without proper hospital care., Severe dengue includes symptoms from both of the above classifications along with any of the following:


Severe bleeding or blood in urine
Severe fluid accumulation in abdomen, lung
Loss of consciousness
Involvement of other organs, such as heart, leading to further fluid accumulation, low pressure, high pulse rate
If any of these symptoms are present, take the person immediately to the nearest hospital.

, All patients with severe dengue or dengue that presents with warning signs should go to the hospital as soon as possible. Those who present without warning signs should also visit the hospital for a thorough check-up and confirmation of diagnosis.

, Treatment can take place either at home or in hospital. For severe cases or those that exhibit warning signs, dengue must be treated in hospital.Home care is an an option only if the patient meets the following three requirements: 1) there are no warning signs present; 2) the patient can tolerate adequate fluids orally; 3) the patient can pass urine at least every six hours.Note that there is no specific medication or cure for dengue. Treatment mostly focuses on treating the symptoms of dengue., While treating dengue patients at home, it's important to prevent further contact with mosquitoes because the infection can spread from person-to-person via mosquitoes. In other words, controlling mosquitoes is key to preventing others from becoming ill.Use window and door screens at home to prevent mosquitoes from entering.
Use mosquito nets while sleeping.
Wear clothes that minimize skin exposure to mosquitoes.
Apply mosquito repellent to exposed skin. Repellants like DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus are effective. Children should not handle repellents. Adults should apply repellents to their own hands first and spread them on the child’s skin. Do not use repellents on children under two months old.
Prevent the breeding of mosquitoes by draining stagnant water around the house and cleaning water storage containers frequently.

, Dengue patients must go to the hospital every day to have their fever and blood count assessed. These daily visits must occur as long as the patient exhibits a fever of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). This monitoring at the hospital can cease after there has been no fever over a 48-hour period., Permit the patient to slowly resume his previous activities, particularly during the long period of convalescence.


Because dengue often causes significant tiredness and lethargy, it's important that patients get plenty of rest and progress back into their daily routines with caution., This medication will help treat the fever. Give one tablet of 325 to 500 mg. A total of four tablets can be given to the patient in one day.Do not give the patient aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These can increase the risk of bleeding in those with dengue., Patients should be encouraged to drink water, fruit juice, and oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration from fever or vomiting.Adequate fluid intake decreases the chance that a patient with dengue will have to be hospitalized.
Men and women (ages 19 to 30 years) should aim to drink three liters and 2.7 liters of water per day, respectively. Boys and girls should have 2.7 and 2.2 liters of water daily, respectively. For infants, the intake is 0.7-0.8 liters/day.
You can also prepare a juice using papaya leaves for dengue patients. Papaya leaf extract has been reported to increase platelet count in dengue patients., although there is not yet firm clinical research to support this., Maintaining a daily record will help you observe any worsening of symptoms. It's important to monitor children and babies closely since they are more likely to develop more serious cases of dengue. Keep clear notes on the following:


The patient's temperature. Since temperature varies during the day, it is preferable to record it at same time daily. This will make your daily reading reliable and valid.
Fluid intake. Ask the patient to drink from the same cup each time; this will make it easier for you to remember and keep track of the total volume consumed.
Urine output. Ask the patient to urinate into a container. Measure and record the amount of urine each time. These containers are commonly used at hospitals to measure 24-hour urine output. You will be provided with one or can inquire about it at the hospital.

, Head to the hospital immediately if the patient exhibits any of the following signs:High fever
Severe abdominal pain
Persistent vomiting
Cold and clammy extremities (could be due to dehydration or blood loss)
Lethargy
Confusion (as a result of poor water intake or blood loss)
Inability to pass urine regularly (at least every 6 hours)
Bleeding (vaginal and/or bleeding, bleeding from nose, eyes or gums, red spots or patches on skin)
Difficulty in breathing (due to fluid collection in lungs)

, To treat severe cases of dengue fever at a hospital, doctors will begin by introducing intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes (salts) into the patient's body. This treatment works to replace the fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea. This step will only be taken if the patient is not able to take fluids orally (e.g., because of severe vomiting) or is in shock.Intravenous means ""within a vein."" In other words, liquid substances will be infused directly into one of the patient's veins via a syringe or intravenous catheter.The recommended first-line IV fluid is crystalloids (0.9% saline).Doctors will monitor the patient's fluid intake through IV due to newer guidelines recommending a more cautious intake of IV fluids than in the past. This is because overhydration can cause adverse effects, including intravascular fluid overload, or a flooding of the capillaries. For this reason, in most cases, doctors will administer fluid in increments, rather than a constant flow., In more advanced and severe cases cases of dengue, doctors may have to perform a transfusion to replace lost blood. This is often the required treatment for patients whose dengue has escalated to DHF.A transfusion can entail transfer of fresh blood into the patient's system or just platelets, which are parts of the blood that help the blood clot and are smaller than red or white blood cells., Corticosteroids are man-made drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by your adrenal glands. These drugs work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system.The effects of corticosteroids on dengue infection are still undergoing medical trials and are as yet inconclusive."

Prevent chikungunya when traveling.",How to Recover from Chikungunya," The acute phase of a disease is a rapid, but short lived period of time where you experience symptoms of the disease.There may be no symptoms for up to two to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Typically, there are no symptoms for three to seven days. Once symptoms appear, you'll probably experience about 10 days of chikungunya symptoms before getting better.You may experience these symptoms during the acute phase:



Fever: The fever is Usually 102 to 105 °F (39 to 40.5 °C) and typically lasts from three days up to one week.The fever can be biphasic (where it disappears for a few days followed by a few days of a low grade fever (101–102 °F or 38–39 °C). During this time, the virus accumulates in your bloodstream, spreading to different parts of the body.

Arthritis (joint pain): You'll usually notice arthritis in the small joints of the hand, wrist, ankles, and larger joints, like knees and shoulders, but not the hips.Up to 70% of people have pain that spreads from one joint to the next after the previous joint starts feeling better.The pain is usually worse in the morning, but improves with mild exercise. Your joints may also look swollen or feel tender to the touch and you may have inflammation of tendons (tenosynovitis).Joint pain usually resolves within one to three weeks, with severe pain improving after the first week. However, in some cases joint pain can continue for up to a year.

Rash: Approximately 40% to 50% of patients experience a rash. The most common type is a morbilliform eruption (maculopapular). These are red rashes with small bumps overlying them that appear three to five days after start of fever and subside within three to four days. The rash usually starts on the upper limbs followed by the face and trunk/torso.Look in the mirror with your shirt off and note any red bumpy areas over a wide area and whether they itch. Make sure to turn around to look at your back side, back of neck, and raise your arms to examine your underarms.;
, The subacute phase of Chikungunya happens a month to three months after the acute phase of the illness ends. During the subacute phase, the main symptom is arthritis. Aside from this, disorders of blood vessels like Raynaud’s phenomenon can occur.


Raynaud’s phenomenon is a condition where there is decreased blood flow to the hands and feet in response to cold or stress on your body. Look at the tips of your fingers and note if they are cold and bluish/dark in color.

, This phase starts following the three months from the initial onset. It's marked by the continuation of joint pain symptoms, with 33% of patients experiencing joint pain (arthralgia) for four months, 15% for 20 months, and 12% for three to five years.One study showed 64% of people reporting joint stiffness and/or pain for over a year after the initial infection.You may also have relapses of fever, asthenia (abnormal physical weakness and/or lack of energy), arthritis (inflammed/swollen joints) in multiple joints, and tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendons).


If you have underlying joint problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, you're more prone to developing the chronic stage of chikungunya.Rheumatoid arthritis has been documented, rarely, after the initial infection. The average time of onset is around 10 months., While fever, rash, and joint pain are the most common or obvious symptoms, many patients experience other issues. These can include:Myalgia (muscle/back pain)
Headache
Sore throat discomfort
Abdominal pain
Constipation
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck

, Since so many symptoms of chikungunya are also symptoms of similar or mosquito-born diseases, it's important to be able to differentiate between them. Diseases similar to chikungunya include:



Leptospirosis: Notice if your calf muscles (the muscles behind your leg below your knees) ache or hurt when you walk. You should also look in the mirror to see if the white part of your eye is bright red (subconjunctival hemorrhage). This is caused by the eruption of tiny blood vessels. Recall if you were around farm animals or water since the contaminated animals can spread this disease in the water or soil.

Dengue fever: Note if you came into contact with mosquitoes or have bites that occurred in tropical climates like Africa, South America, Central America, Caribbean, India and southern parts of North America. Dengue is more prevalent in these areas. Look in the mirror for bruising of the skin, bleeding or redness around the white of your eyes, bleeding from the gums of your mouth and repeated bloody noses. Bleeding is the biggest difference between dengue fever and chikungunya.

Malaria: Note if you came into contact with mosquitoes or bites from known source areas such as South America, Africa, India, Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Pay attention to whether you feel cold and shiver, then have fevers and then sweating. This can last from six to 10 hours. You may experience relapses of these phases.

Meningitis: Look for local outbreaks in highly congested areas or facilities. If you were in the area you may have gotten the disease. Check your temperature for a fever and note if you have neck stiffness or pain/discomfort when moving your neck. Severe headaches and feeling tired/confused may accompany the disease. You may also have a rash that consists of red, brown, or purple small dots that can become larger blotches or even blisters. This rash is commonly located on the trunk, legs, and on the palms and soles.

Rheumatic fever: Rheumatic fever usually occurs after a streptococcal infection such as strep throat. It is not caused by mosquito bites. This happens more commonly in children five to 15 years old. Check your child for multiple joint pains that can migrate (as one joint gets better another joint hurts) and fever like in chikungunya. But, noticeable differences in your child will be uncontrollable or jerky body movements (chorea); small, painless nodules under the skin; and a rash. The rash will be flat or slightly elevated with jagged edges (erythema marginatum) and will appear blotchy or circular with a darker pink ring and lighter area inside the ring., Your doctor can collect blood samples to test for chikungunya and other mosquito-borne diseases. You should see your doctor if you experience any of the following:Fever for more than five days or above 103 °F (39°C)
Dizziness (possibly due to a neurological issue or dehydration)
Cold fingers or toes (raynaud's)
Bleeding from mouth or under skin (this can be Dengue)
Rash
Joint pain, redness, stiffness, or swelling
Low urine output (this can be from dehydration that can lead to kidney damage)

, Your doctor will take blood samples to send to labs. Several tests or methods will be run on the samples for diagnosis. ELISA (enzyme linked immunoassay) will look for specific antibodies against the virus. These antibodies normally develop toward the end of the first week of illness and peak around three to weeks lasting up to two months. If they are negative, your doctor may repeat the blood test to see if they have risen.Viral cultures will also look for growth. These are usually used within the first 3 days of illness, when the virus is rapidly growing.RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) methods use virus-specific gene coding proteins to replicate specific genes of chikungunya. If it is chikungunya, then the lab will see higher than normal chikungunya genes displayed on a computerized graph., There is no approved/specific treatment or cure for this virus nor a vaccine to prevent you from getting it. Treatment is purely symptom management. The World Health Organization recommends that you start home care treatment by resting. This will provide relief and time for your body to recover. Rest in an environment that is not damp or too hot, which could aggravate your joint symptoms.Apply a cold pack to reduce pain and inflammation. You can use a bag of frozen vegetables, packaged steak, or an ice pack. Wrap the frozen back in a towel and apply it to painful areas. Avoid applying a frozen pack or ice directly to your skin, which could cause tissue damage.

, If you're experiencing fever and joint pain, take paracetamol or acetaminophen. Take up to two 500mg tablets with water up to four times a day. Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Since fever can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, try to drink at least two liters of water a day with added salt (which mimics electrolyte sodium).


If you have pre-existing liver or kidney issues consult your doctor before taking paracetamol/acetaminophen. Talk to your pediatrician or pharmacist for dosing for children.
Do not take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen, naproxen, etc. Chikungunya can mimic other mosquito-borne diseases like dengue which can cause excessive bleeding. Aspirin and NSAIDS can thin your blood and increase the bleeding. Your doctor must rule out Dengue first. Your doctor may recommend NSAIDS for the joint symptoms after ruling out Dengue.
If you have unbearable joint pain or no relief after your doctor has advised you to take NSAIDS, your doctor may prescribe you hydroxychloroquine 200 mg orally once a day or chloroquine phosphate 300 mg once per day for up to 4 weeks.

, You should only perform mild exercises so you don't aggravate your muscle or joint pains. If possible, arrange an appointment with a physical therapist to undergo physiotherapy treatment. This can help strengthen your muscles around the joints which can reduce pain and stiffness. Try to exercise in the morning, when your joints may be the stiffest. Try some of these simple movements:


Sit on a chair. Extend one leg parallel to the floor and hold for 10 seconds before lowering your leg with the sole flat on the floor. Do the same with the other leg. Repeat this several times a day, doing two to three sets of 10 repetitions per leg.
Try standing on your toes with both feet close together and place your heels up and down, up and down.
Turn to your side. Raise one leg upwards for a second before bringing it down atop your other leg. Do this 10 times for that leg. Then, turn to the other side, and repeat. Do a set of 10 raises for each leg several times a day.
You can also do your own low-impact aerobic exercise. The idea is not to do aggressive movements or use weights.

, You may experience scaling dryness (xerosis) or an itchy rash (morbilliform rash). These don't need treatment, but you can treat the itchiness and rebuild your skin's natural conditions and moisture. Apply mineral oils, moisturizing creams, or calamine lotion.If you have the itchy rash, take oral antihistamines, like diphenhydramine, as directed on the package. This can reduce inflammatory cells from releasing proteins that cause itching.


Be careful using antihistamines, as they can make you drowsy. Don't drive or operate machinery after taking them.
Soaking in a warm bath with added colloidal oatmeal can help sooth your skin.
Persistent hyperpigmented spots can be treated with hydroquinone-based products. This will help whiten or lighten the spots.Since a variety of liquids and creams are available to treat skin irritation, you may want to ask your doctor's advice about what to use.

, It's been suggested that many combinations of herbs and plants can help relieve the symptoms of chikungunya. While you can find most of these at drug stores, you should always consult with your doctor before trying herbal supplements or remedies. Herbal remedies include:Eupatorium perfoliatum 200C: This is the number one homeopathic remedy for chikungunya. It is a plant based extract that you should use while experiencing the symptoms. It can relieve the symptoms and joint pain. To use, take six drops at full strength for a month, while symptoms exist.
Echinacea: This is a flower-based extract used to treat chikungunya symptoms by improving your immune system's effectiveness. Take a 40 drops a day, divided into three daily doses.

, Specifically, pay attention for abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which can be potentially fatal.To check, take the pads of your index and middle fingers, gently placing them on your wrist below the thumb area. If you feel a pulse this is the radial artery. Count how many beats you feel over a minute. 60 to 100 beats is considered normal. Also, note if the rhythm is a constant beat; extra beats or abnormal pauses may mean an arrhythmia. You may also notice skipped or extra beats in the form of palpitations. See your doctor right away if you notice signs of an arrhythmia. Your doctor may do an electrocardiogram, where electrodes are attached to your chest to check your heart's rhythm.


The chikungunya virus can invade heart tissue causing inflammation (myocarditis), which causes the abnormal heart rhythms.

, Look for fever, fatigue, and mental confusion, which are signs of encephalitis or inflammation of the brain. Distraction and disorientation is also a sign. If you also notice severe headache, neck stiffness/pain, sensitivity to light, fever, seizures, double vision, nausea and vomiting in addition to the encephalitis symptoms, you may have meningoencephalitis. This is a combination of meningitis and encephalitis (inflammation of the tissue in our spinal cord that is connected to the brain).If you experience nerve damage starting from the legs or arms, you may have Guillain Barre syndrome. Look for decreased sensation, reflexes, and movement on both sides of your body. Also notice pain on both sides of the body that feels sharp, burning, numbness or pins and needles sensation. This can gradually progress higher up the body and potentially lead to breathing troubles from nerves that supply your respiratory muscles.If you have trouble breathing or any of the above symptoms, seek emergency care immediately., Look for eye pain, watery eyes and red eyes. These can all be symptoms of inflammation of your eye linings caused by conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and uveitis. You may also notice blurry vision and sensitivity to light with uveitis. See your doctor right away if you have any of these eye symptoms.


If you have trouble seeing objects straight ahead (central vision) and if the colors of objects you see everyday look duller, you may have neuroretinitis., Look in the mirror for any yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). These can be signs of hepatitis, inflammation of the liver. This inflammation can make the liver's products (bilirubin) spill over and cause your skin to turn yellow and itchy. Get immediate medical attention.


If untreated, hepatitis can lead to liver failure.

, Chikungunya can lead to dehydration since the kidneys may not get enough blood flow to function normally. This can lead to kidney failure, so monitor your urine output. If you feel the amount is drastically decreased and your urine is very concentrated and dark colored seek immediate medical expertise.


Your doctor or emergency provider will perform more accurate lab tests and measurements to detect kidney function and give you IV fluids if you are dehydrated.

, Look on the Center for Disease Control's website for an updated map of where chikungunya has been reported.If you're traveling in any of these areas there are several things you can do to help prevent getting the disease. These preventative measures include:Walking or being outside after daylight hours. Though mosquitoes can bite anytime, peak chikungunya activity is during daylight hours.
Wearing long sleeve clothing to protect your body as much as possible from mosquitoes. Try wearing light colored clothing to easily detect mosquitoes and other bugs on your clothing.
Sleeping in a bed/mosquito net at night to protect from mosquitoes while sleeping.
Using repellents with more than 20% DEET. Other active ingredients to use include oil of eucalyptus, Picaridin, and IR3535. Generally the higher the active ingredient, the longer it works.

"
Watch for a high fever.,
Take notice of severe shaking chills.,
Look out for headaches and muscle pains.,
Be suspicious of vomiting with diarrhea.,
Recognize the advanced symptoms.,
Be very cautious of underdeveloped tropical areas.,
Be particularly careful if your immune system is weak.,
Avoid contaminated blood.,
Take preventative measures if traveling to at-risk areas.",How to Recognize Malaria Symptoms," One of the primary symptoms that is so common with a malarial infection is a high fever, at least 102°F (38.9°C).It's also one of the first symptoms to appear as early as seven days (although usually between 10 – 15 days) after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Often the fever comes and goes randomly. This is thought to be related to the malaria parasites transiently spreading into blood from the liver.


There are at least five types of Plasmodium parasites that infect people, although P. falciparum (mainly in Africa) and P. vivax (mainly in Latin America and Asia) are the most common and deadly.
The fever and other initial symptoms may be mild and mimic less serious viral infections, such as the common cold and influenza.
Usually symptoms don't appear for about two weeks after being bitten.;
, The other primary symptom of malaria is severe shaking chills with intermittent periods of sweating.Again, shaking chills are typical of many other types of infections, but they are usually more pronounced and severe with malaria. They can cause teeth to chatter and even prevent sleep. When they're severe, the shaking can be mistaken for seizures. The chills from malaria are usually not remedied by blanket cover or by wearing warmer clothes.


Although the primary symptoms of malaria typically begin within a few weeks of being bitten by an infected mosquito, some types of malarial parasites can lie dormant in the body for up to a year or more.Malarial symptoms are caused by the bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasite into the host's bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver where they lay dormant for a week or two before causing symptoms.

, Secondary and less specific symptoms of malaria are moderate-to-severe headaches, often combined with mild muscle aches.These secondary symptoms often occur a short while after the above-mentioned primary symptoms as the parasite needs a little more time to proliferate in the liver and spread around the body in the bloodstream. Headaches and muscle aches are also very common with most other infections, as well as from the bites of other insects and spiders.


The bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes are not very noticeable (a small, red, itchy bump), unlike the bites of some other insects and spiders that can cause similar symptoms.
The initial headaches of malaria are typically dull in nature (like a tension headache), but as the parasites start to infect and destroy red blood cells, they can become pounding in nature (more like a migraine).
The achy pain is usually most noticeable in the leg and back muscles because they are larger, more active and get more of the infected blood.

, Other non-specific secondary symptoms of malaria are vomiting and diarrhea, multiple times per day.They often occur in combination with each other, which mimics the initial symptoms of food poisoning and other bacterial infections. The main difference is that the vomiting/diarrhea caused by food poisoning fades away within a few days, whereas it can remain for a few weeks with malaria (depending on treatment).


Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea of some bacterial infections, particularly Shigella, there's usually no blood or severe cramping with malaria.
Once the primary and secondary symptoms become noticeable, the malaria-causing parasites can be seen under a microscope from a drop of infected blood — especially if the specimen is stained with Giemsa stain., If the advancing primary and secondary symptoms don't prompt the infected person to seek medical attention and get treatment (which may not be possible in the developing world), then symptoms begin to appear that signify serious injury / damage to the body.When these advanced symptoms of malaria appear, the risk of health complications and death significantly increase.


Confusion, multiple convulsions, coma and neurological impairment indicate brain swelling and injury.
Severe anemia, abnormal bleeding, deep labored breathing and respiratory distress indicate advanced blood infection and lung involvement.
Jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes) is evidence of liver damage and dysfunction.
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Shock (very low blood pressure)
Enlarged spleen

, The biggest risk factor for coming down with malaria is either living in or traveling to tropical countries where the infection is common.The most risky areas are African countries south of the Sahara Desert, most of the Asian subcontinent, Haiti, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 90% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa — mostly in kids younger than five years.
Approximately 1,500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, mostly in returned travelers., People with immature or weakened immune systems are especially susceptible of getting infected by Plasmodium parasites and developing malaria. This group includes infants, children younger than five years, pregnant women, the elderly and patients with HIV/AIDS.As such, don't travel to high-risk countries if you are in this group and/or don't bring young children with you.


Strong immune systems can fight off malarial infections, which means the majority of people bitten by infected mosquitoes either don't get the disease or develop only mild short-term symptoms.
Supplements that can boost your immune system include: vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root.Be aware that these will not prevent malaria or its consequences.

, The Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria primarily infect the liver, but also the red blood cells within blood. Consequently, people can also catch malaria by being exposed to contaminated (infected) blood.Common modes of transmission due to contaminated blood include blood transfusions, sharing needles to inject drugs and childbirth (from an infected mother to her unborn child).


Hemophiliacs and people who lose lots of blood from injuries are at higher risk of malaria from blood transfusions, particularly if they life in Africa or Asia.
Malaria is not considered an STD (sexually transmitted disease), although there is a small chance of contracting it via sexual practices if the blood from one partner enters the bloodstream of another.

, To prevent bites from Anopheles mosquitoes, avoid excessive exposure to the outdoors; wear long sleeves, pants, and cover as much skin as possible; wear insect repellant that contains N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) or picaridin); stay in well-screened or air-conditioned rooms; and sleep within bed nets treated with insecticide (such as permethrin). In addition, discuss taking anti-malarial medication with your doctor.

Some drugs your doctor might suggest include chloroquine, atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem), mefloquine (Lariam), quinine, quinidine, doxycycline, clindamycin and artesunate (not currently licensed in the U.S.)."
"
Determine if you’re at risk of malaria.Though certain populations are at higher risk, anyone can get malaria.,
Watch for symptoms after you've been in a high-risk country.,
Learn about the different types of malaria.Malaria is commonly seen in one of three manners: as uncomplicated malaria, as severe malaria, or as a malaria relapse.,
Recognize the symptoms of uncomplicated malaria.Uncomplicated malaria can appear in recurring ""attacks"" that typically last six to 10 hours.,
Watch carefully for symptoms of severe malaria.,
Contact your medical professional.Regardless of whether you're showing symptoms, you should always let your doctor know immediately when you've travelled to a high risk area.,
Submit to a blood smear.To check your blood for the parasites that cause malaria, your doctor will take a blood sample to be analyzed in the lab.,
Get early diagnosis and treatment.,
Take your prescribed medications.Your doctor has many options to choose from when deciding how to treat your malaria.,
Stay comfortable during treatment.The best thing you can do is get plenty of rest during the recovery process.,
Wait for the fever to subside.Treatment for malaria is aggressive and fast-acting.,
Take primaquine to prevent relapses.Although your initial bout of malaria may be gone, the disease can recur sporadically for years afterward.,
Avoid further mosquito bites.If you live in a low-risk area, do not travel to high-risk areas while you are recovering from malaria.",How to Treat Malaria," You should be aware of the risk factors to know if there’s a possibility you’ve contracted the disease. In very rare cases, it can be spread through blood transfusions or organ transplants if the medical staff has made a mistake in screening the donor. Sharing needles for injection can also spread the disease. However, because the disease is most often spread by mosquito bites, most people with malaria are found in tropical and subtropical climates.


The CDC offers a thorough listing of malaria risk by country.Countries where you're highly likely to contract malaria include Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, and Liberia, among others. The deadliest strains of malaria are found in Africa, south of the Sahara.Note that the risk is posed not just to people who live in these countries, but also those traveling through them.;
, Malaria normally has an incubation period of about seven to 30 days before symptoms begin appearing. But if you're a traveller from a low-risk country, you may have taken preventative anti-malarial medication before entering the country. If you contract malaria despite that medication, the medication can still slow down the disease's progression. It might take months for your symptoms to appear.To be safe, you should be vigilant for a full year after traveling to a high-risk area. Remind your doctor of your travels during every check-up during that year.

, Uncomplicated malaria is the most common type, but it is rarely seen in hospital settings because people mistake it for cold, flu, or a simple infection. Residents of high-risk areas often recognize the symptoms as uncomplicated malaria and treat it on their own. Severe malaria, on the other hand, can cause organ failure and is potentially lethal. It requires immediate medical attention. Relapses after an initial bout of malaria often go unnoticed because they may not always present with noticeable symptoms.

, During these bouts, patients progress from the cold stage, through the hot stage, then the sweating stage.


In the cold stage, they feel cold and shiver.
During the hot stage, they experience fever, headaches, and vomiting. Children may experience seizures.
In the sweating stage, the patient experiences fatigue and excessive sweating while the body returns to a normal temperature.
Other symptoms include yellowed skin from mild jaundice and rapid breathing.

, Many people have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, or body aches.If the infection progresses to a stage where it interferes with organ, blood, or metabolism function, symptoms become more dramatic. Severe malaria is potentially lethal, and requires immediate medical attention. Contact your doctor or emergency services if you experience any of the following:


Strange behavior changes
Loss of consciousness
Seizures
Anemia (you may look pale, feel very tired or weak, have dizziness, or have a rapid heart rate)
Dark or reddish urine (from hemoglobin)
Trouble breathing
Abnormal blood coagulation
Low blood pressure
Kidney failure (decreased urine, swollen legs or feet from fluid retention, chest pain or pressure)Low blood sugar (especially in pregnant women)

, While those in high-risk areas sometimes ""wait and see"" if uncomplicated malaria will progress, people in low-risk areas should not. If you have any suspicion that you have malaria, you should contact your doctor immediately to get tested and treated.

, Even if your first blood smear comes back negative for malaria parasites, the doctor will repeat the test every eight to 12 hours for 36 hours.


The doctor may also order a rapid blood test to indicate whether there's significant risk of malaria. If the initial rapid blood test is positive, he or she will order blood smears to confirm the diagnosis.
Your doctor will also test your blood for a CBC and test the function of your liver and possibly other organs.

, Although malaria can be dangerous and deadly, it's also a highly treatable disease. While there's not yet a vaccine to prevent contracting the disease, early treatment has proven to be very effective at containing and curing it.The success of your treatment depends on contacting your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

, He or she will choose a regimen for you based on what type of malaria parasite was found in your blood smear, your age, whether you're pregnant, and the severity of your symptoms. Most malaria treatments are taken orally, but patients with complications might need IV medication. Like any living organism, the parasites that cause malaria can adapt to fight off medications, but the following drugs have a high success rate:


Chloroquine (Aralen)
Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin)
Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)
Mefloquine
Combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone)

, Because there are so many options for treating malaria, not everyone will have the same experience. However, common side effects include blurred vision, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain or upset. Some of the drugs also cause heartburn, insomnia, anxiety or mental clouding, and dizziness or coordination problems.


Pay attention to your body to pick up on these side effects, and report them to your doctor when you experience them. They may be able to give you additional medications to help combat them.
Drink lots of fluids to prevent heartburn.
Fluids are especially important if you are experiencing vomiting or diarrhea. You lose a lot of water through these side effects, and have to rehydrate yourself to keep your body as healthy as possible.
Stick to a bland diet to treat stomach upset.
Stay off your feet, and don't over-exert yourself if you're having coordination problems.
Your doctor will monitor you for signs of dehydration, anemia, and seizures. She will watch for complications affecting your organs.

, If everything goes according to plan and you don’t suffer any complications, your fever should be gone within 36-48 hours. In most cases, the bacteria that cause malaria will be completely out of your system within two to three days, and you will be recovered within two weeks.The doctor will continue to test your blood smears while you’re being treated for malaria. If the treatment is successful, they will see a decrease in the number of malaria parasites in your blood with every smear.

, Though this often happens without noticeable symptoms, you may feel flu-like symptoms during relapses. Either way, you want to prevent the infection from returning as best you can. Primaquine is an anti-malarial taken after other drugs have killed off the malaria parasites in your blood.


You will begin taking primaquine two weeks after the malaria has passed.
Your dosage and length of treatment will be based on your specific case: what kind of infection you had and how you responded to treatment. Most often, a two-week course is recommended.
Follow your doctor's instruction exactly. Do not adjust dosages up or down in any way, and take the medication on the exact schedule prescribed.

, Additional mosquito bites may prove disastrous. If you live in an area where malaria is common, protect yourself as best as possible.


Cover your skin with long pants and sleeves, even in hot weather.
Wear mosquito repellent at all times.
Look specifically for products containing DEET, Picaridin, Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD, or IR3535. Check the packaging to make sure your products have these effective chemicals in them.
Light mosquito-repellent candles to keep mosquitos out of your area.
Stay in screened-in, air-conditioned areas where mosquitos are less likely to be.
Use bed nets when sleeping in areas infested with mosquitoes.

Look for tick bites.,
Take outdoor activity into account.,
Inspect your dog for ticks.,
Track the time since being bitten.",How to Recognize Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Symptoms1," Tick bites are often painless, and you may not have noticed if you were bitten. Tick bites can be very small. Look over your body carefully. A bite will look like a swollen red bump. There will be a raised, red circle around this bite. (If you do not see the red circle, you may have been bitten by a different insect.) This bite may or may not itch., You may have picked up a tick while outside. Ticks frequently live in wooded areas or tall, damp grasses.They will often cling to your legs as you walk through the grass. If you were hiking in tick infested areas or if you were walking through tall grass, consider the possibility that you may have bitten without knowing.


Tick bites are more common in the spring and summer., If you suspect you have RMSF but you are uncertain how, you may want to see if your dog has ticks. Dogs can pick up ticks while playing outside, but their fur will often disguise the bugs. These ticks can then crawl off your dog onto your furniture or your skin. Carefully run a gloved hand or brush against your dog’s fur so that you can see their skin. You may feel a swollen tick before you see one. If you find a tick, remove it from the dog with tweezers, and drown the tick in a glass of water.Take your dog to the vet so that it can receive treatment for the ticks.


Be sure to carefully check the dog’s head, neck, ears, toes, and tail as these are the places ticks are most likely to hide.
Alternatively, if you have already determined that you have a tick bite, you may want to take your dog to be checked by the vet. Just because you did not see a tick on your dog does not mean that there was no tick. Ticks that have not fed are very small, and they may be hard to see.

, If you know that you have been bitten by a tick, note when the bite occurred. Initial symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever usually appear between two and fourteen days after you have been bitten by a tick."
"
Take your temperature.,
Note any pain.,
Watch for gastrointestinal issues.,
Look out for a rash.",How to Recognize Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Symptoms2," As suggested in the name, fever is a symptom of RMSF.Using an oral thermometer, take your temperature. You may feel flushed, have a headache, or feel groggy and confused. If your fever is above 103 F (39.4 C), call a doctor., Severe headaches and muscle pain are key symptoms of RMSF.While there are many reasons why you could be feeling such pain, it could be a sign of RMSF if taken into consideration with other symptoms.


As the disease develops, you may also note some abdominal pain. This will feel like a sharp pain, similar to appendicitis. Abdominal pain is common in children with the illness., Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are all signs of RMSF. Nausea is an early sign, and it may be accompanied by a loss of appetite. Diarrhea, while rare, may occur as the disease progresses., A spotted rash may develop on your wrists and ankles. It can spread throughout your body.The rash will begin as a few itchy spots and develop into a red or purple mark on your skin. A dark rash is a sign that the disease has progressed to its later stages. Seek immediate medical attention.About 10% of RMSF sufferers do not develop a rash. If you think you have RMSF but do not have a rash, you should still seek medical attention."
"
Seek early treatment.,
Ask for a blood test.,
Confirm with a skin test.,
Get medication before the fifth day.",How to Recognize Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Symptoms3," The earlier you can get treatment, the less likely you are to develop severe complications, such as necrosis, scarring, or death.If you are displaying symptoms and you suspect that you could have been bitten, you should go to the doctor. The doctor can help you determine if it is really RMSF or if it is a disease with similar symptoms. You should tell your doctor:


If you have been bitten by a tick.
If you have been in tall grass or wooded areas.
If anyone else in your family is sick.
If your dog has ticks., While there is no diagnostic test that can determine RMSF for certain, there are certain clues to your condition that may appear in a blood test. Patients with RMSF tend to have low blood platelet count, low sodium levels, or elevated liver enzyme levels., If you have developed a rash, your doctor may do a biopsy to make sure that the disease is really RMSF or another similar illness. Be aware that lab tests take time, and your doctor will most likely start you on antibiotics before the results return., The earlier you treat your spotted fever, the more likely you are to heal. Doxycycline is the most effective medication for RMSF. In fact, if you take doxycycline and do not improve, it may be a sign that you are not suffering from RMSF.If you are pregnant, your doctor may prescribe chloramphenicol instead. Do not take doxycycline if you are expecting."

You must be south of the equator to contract Yellow Fever.,
Following being bitten by an infected mosquito, initial symptoms of a person infected present themselves three to six days later.,
Pay very close attention to the following after a remission, as you may need to move very quickly to get the infected person to a hospital for supportive care for symptoms such as follows:


High fever, headache, back pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue.,
Final stages of the disease may include the following symptoms:


Hypotension (low blood pressure), shock, metabolic acidosis (accumulation of acids in bodily fluids), acute tubular necrosis (damage or death to cells of the urinary tract), myocardial dysfunction (dysfunction of the heart muscle), and cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).

",How to Recognize Yellow Fever1," Click on a map of either continent below to see of you are or may be at risk.;
, They will be typically flu-like and include the following:


Fever and chills, severe headache, back pain, general muscle aches, nausea, fatigue, and weakness. This phase may be followed by a short period of symptom remission.
This is not enough information to make a decent diagnosis of yellow fever because the symptoms are too vague.

,
Hepatic coagulopathy, which means bleeding of the liver, produces hemorrhagic (which means, literally, to bleed profusely) symptoms, including hematemesis (black vomit), epistaxis (nose bleed), gum bleeding, and petechial and purpuric hemorrhages (bruising).
Deepening jaundice (yellowing of the skin) frequently occurs in severe cases.

Know that all residents of areas where virus activity has been identified are at risk of getting West Nile Virus.,
Be aware that infection with WNV can be asymptomatic (no symptoms), or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease (neuroinvasive disease).,
Recognize the symptoms of these neuroinvasive diseases.,
Understand that it is estimated that about 20% of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever.,
Know that most people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with West Nile virus will not develop any type of illness.,
Be aware that when someone is infected with West Nile virus (WNV) they will typically have one of three outcomes: No symptoms (most likely), West Nile fever (about 20% of people) or severe West Nile disease (less than 1% of those who get infected).",How to Recognize Symptoms of West Nile Virus,";
, Specific types of neuroinvasive disease include: West Nile encephalitis, West Nile meningitis, and West Nile meningoencephalitis.

, These symptoms include:


Headache
High fever

Neck stiffness
Stupor
Disorientation
Coma
Tremors
Convulsions
Muscle weakness
Paralysis

, Look for these symptoms:


Fever
Headache
Tiredness
Body aches
Occasionally a skin rash (on the trunk of the body)
Swollen lymph glands

, However, you cannot know if you'll get sick or not when infected.

, Although there is no treatment for WNV infection, the person with severe disease often needs to be hospitalized. People with West Nile fever recover on their own. Medication for headache and body aches can bring relief.

There is no cure, per se, for yellow fever once a person has contracted it.,
The best cure is prevention, and this article is largely intended to provide useful ways of preventing this disease rather than identifying the symptoms once a person has become infected.

,
There is an extremely effective vaccination Against Yellow Fever.,
Many countries require poof of vaccination in order to enter the country.,
Yellow fever vaccination must be given at a certified center in possession of an official “Uniform Stamp” which can be used to validate the ICVP.",How to Recognize Yellow Fever2," Viruses do not respond to antibiotics, which are only effective against bacterial infections. If the person concerned has not been vaccinated or presents secondary symptoms as described above, treat them as though you were treating a person with a life-and-death syndrome of influenza. Hydration and providing the person with basic nutrients are best in the case of any major viral illness, with hydration being the top priority.

,, Although most occurrences of this viral disease are generally spread throughout the continents of South America and sub-Saharan Africa, measures below should be taken to ensure that any person traveling to these areas be immunized via vaccination from this preventable, potentially lethal disease prior to traveling.

, The required documentation, provided at the time of vaccination, is called the International Certificate for Vaccination and Prophylaxis against Yellow Fever. See the table below to find out if you are traveling to a country that requires vaccination prior to entry.


Access to the the countries listed in the table below will likely be denied to travelers without this certificate.

, State health departments are responsible for designating non-federal yellow fever vaccination centers and issuing Uniform Stamps to health-care providers.


Information about the location and hours of yellow fever vaccination centers may be obtained by contacting local or state health departments or visiting CDC’s Travelers’ Health website.

Watch for a circular rash.,
Pay attention to fever, chills, and aches.,
See a doctor immediately if suffering from intense fatigue.",How to Recognize Lyme Disease Symptoms1," The most telltale sign of Lyme disease is the presence of a rash known as erythema migrans, or EM. The rash most commonly develops between seven and ten days after the bite, but it may develop in as few as three days or as many as thirty days after. The rash will expand over the course of a few days, potentially growing to more than 12 inches (30.5 cm). EM rashes are almost always circular in shape, and may clear up in the center, leaving the visual representation of a “bull’s eye.”Note that the rash only appears in 70 to 80% of infected individuals, so the lack of a rash does not guarantee that you are not infected.
The rash may arise anywhere on the body and may even occur in multiple locations, though it will usually envelop the location of a bite.
Though the rash may feel warm to the touch, it will likely not itch or cause you any pain.
The rash may begin looking uniformly red, then develop the ""bull's eye"" or a more complex shape as they expand.
The edges of an EM rash may be irregular or hard to see. It may also ultimately range in size from that of a coin to the width of your back!Have any rash that develops following a tick bite checked out by a doctor.;
, Within three to thirty days of infection, you may begin experiencing mild symptoms that could potentially be mistaken for another type of illness. If you know you were bitten by a tick, even a simple fever may indicate you’ve been infected with Lyme disease, so pay diligent attention to your health following a tick bite.Muscle and joint aches may come and go, and will vary in severity.
Swollen lymph nodes are another classic sign of infection.
Recurring chills or headaches, and a persistent fever are other symptoms to watch out for.
If you’re experiencing these symptoms, even mildly, see a doctor to ensure you’re not infected.

, A powerful case of fatigue is another early warning sign of a Lyme disease infection. If you are so tired or sore that you struggle to get out of bed, see a doctor. Though it may feel like you simply have a bad case of the flu, it is important to make sure you’re not infected.Fatigue symptoms may even dramatically lessen after a short period of time, though this does not indicate that you are not infected.

Remain alert for headaches, neck stiffness, and joint pain.,
Look out for signs of facial muscle issues.,
Watch out for heart complications.,
Be aware of any changes in your neurological health.,
Recognize the long-term effects of untreated Lyme disease.",How to Recognize Lyme Disease Symptoms2," Though they may develop in the course of a few days, some symptoms of Lyme disease may take months to develop. Severe headaches, stiffness in your neck, or arthritis-like pain in your joints may indicate an untreated infection. See a doctor immediately if you're experiencing any persistent stiffness, particularly in your knees, shoulders, elbows, or ankles.Muscle, bone, joint, and tendon pain from a Lyme disease infection may be intermittent.
Numbness, or tingling in the hands and feet are also cause for concern.

, Bell’s palsy is a condition in which the muscles on your face lose definition or begin to droop, and may be caused by Lyme disease. In fact, any issues with your facial muscles may indicate a Lyme disease infection. If any part of your face becomes weaker, or it seems as though you’ve lost control of muscles on any part of your face, see a doctor as soon as possible., Lyme carditis is a rare condition that occurs as a symptom of Lyme disease and affects the regularity of your heart beat. Watch out for heart palpitations or any irregularity in your heart beat, including sudden, drastic changes in heart rate. Dizziness and shortness of breath may also indicate Lyme carditis.See a doctor as soon as possible if you're experiencing any of these symptoms.
Note that these and many other symptoms related to a Lyme disease infection may come and go, or even disappear without treatment. The infection, however, may still be present, and will require treatment to prevent any further health complications.

, The important neurological issues to watch out for include numbness, cognitive problems, and shooting pains. These may indicate inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and need to be addressed immediately.Shooting pains in any part of your body that occur at night are a readily recognizable sign of neurological issues.
Numbness or tingling sensations in your extremities may also indicate potential neurological issues caused by Lyme disease.
Any cognitive issues you notice, even simply changes in your short-term memory, may also indicate neurological complications.

, If initial symptoms are mild, you may not notice a Lyme disease infection for years. Weakness, especially weakness associated with severe fatigue is a cause for concern, as is any partial or complete loss of short-term memory. Further, if any of the following symptoms also occur, especially in combination, you should see a doctor immediately:Heightened sensitivity to light or sound.
A noticeable loss of appetite.
Pain that moves around your body, or pain behind your eyes.
Any loss of feeling or recurring numbness in the extremities.
Trouble swallowing.
Depression or seizures.
Hepatitis of other liver complications.

Remove ticks as soon as possible.,
Get a professional diagnosis.,
Expect to treat Lyme disease with antibiotics.",How to Recognize Lyme Disease Symptoms3," In order to be infected with Lyme disease, a tick will usually have to be attached to your body for 36 hours. This allows for plenty of time to safely remove a tick and prevent infection. Be sure to check yourself, your children, and your pets for ticks after spending time outdoors in areas where Lyme disease had been reported., It is especially hard to diagnose a case of Lyme disease. A clear “bull’s eye” rash is the only way to readily diagnose early Lyme disease, as this is the only symptom unique to this disease; however, not everyone develops the rash. Furthermore, many of the other symptoms associated with Lyme disease are very similar to the symptoms cause by other, more common illnesses.Further, you may not know you’ve been bitten — so you may not suspect Lyme disease yourself. Bites themselves are tiny, and often entirely painless.
You will need your blood tested by a doctor to diagnose Lyme disease without the presence of an EM rash. These antibodies may not be present in your blood until a few weeks after infection. You will likely have to go through multiple tests at various levels of specificity to establish an accurate diagnosis.
If you see any other tests advertised to test for late Lyme disease that do not involve a blood test, these tests are not legitimate.

, Your doctor will guide your through the treatment process of Lyme disease, which will likely include antibiotics. Depending on what stage your lyme disease is in when you are diagnosed, the length of time you will need to take antibiotics and which antibiotic you need to take may vary. In early disease (with EM rash), you would need to take for about two to three weeks every day.


Once you begin treatment, your EM rash may subside, and pain and neurological issues should stop worsening; however, muscular and joint aches may persist for some time, as well as trouble concentration and short-term memory."

, A high fever is the first symptom to appear.Fevers with dengue fever are high, ranging from 102°F to 105°F (38.9°C to 40.6°C).The high fever lasts for two to seven days, returns to normal or even a little below normal, then can rebound. You may develop a high fever again that can last for several more days., The initial symptoms that develop after the fever begins are generally non-specific, and are described as flu-like in nature.Common symptoms that occur after the fever begins include severe frontal headache, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and a rash.Dengue fever was once called “break-bone fever” due to the severe pain that is sometimes felt in the joints and muscles., Other common symptoms caused by the virus can create hemodynamic changes, or changes that alter the flow of blood in the body.Examples of blood flow changes seen with dengue fever include nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums, and areas of bruising.Additional symptoms related to changes in blood flow may be evident by reddened areas in the eyes and a sore or inflamed throat., The rash usually begins three to four days after you developed the fever, can get better for one to two days, but then can come back.The initial rash often involves the facial area, and can appear as flushed skin or spotty and reddened areas. The rash does not itch.The second rash begins on the trunk area, then spreads to the face, the arms, and the legs. The second rash can last from two to three days.In some cases, a rash that is made of small dots, called petechiae, may appear anywhere on the body as the fever subsides. Other rashes that sometimes occur include an itchy rash on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet., If you have symptoms consistent with dengue fever, see your doctor as soon as possible to determine the diagnosis.


Blood tests are available that can help your doctor to determine if you have been exposed to dengue fever.Your doctor will do blood work that helps to identify the presence of antibodies to dengue fever. It does take several weeks to get the full results of the blood tests.Changes in your platelet count can be checked to help verify the diagnosis. People that are infected with dengue fever have lower than normal platelet counts.An additional test called the tourniquet test can help with the diagnosis by providing your doctor with information about the condition of your capillaries. This test is not conclusive, but can be used to help with the diagnosis.Research is underway to develop new tests that confirm the diagnosis of dengue fever, including some that are point-of-care tests. Point-of-care tests can be performed at the doctor’s office or in a hospital setting and provide quick confirmation of the infection.Your signs and symptoms are often enough for your doctor to determine that you have been infected with dengue fever, start supportive treatment, and monitor your progress., While dengue fever is a global problem, there are areas where the infection is more prevalent, and locations where it has never been reported.The areas of the world where you are more likely to be bitten by a mosquito that carries dengue fever include tropical locations such as Puerto Rico, Latin America, Mexico, the Honduras, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.The World Health Organization also identifies other areas that have cases frequently reported including some areas of Africa, South America, Australia, Eastern Mediterranean countries, and island locations in the western Pacific.Recent cases have been reported in Europe, France, Croatia, the Madeira islands of Portugal, China, Singapore, Costa Rica, and Japan., In 2013, several cases were reported in Florida.A recent report posted in July of 2015 indicates that no cases of dengue fever have yet been reported in Florida during 2015.Ten counties in California have reported cases of dengue fever over the past two years.As of July, 2015, several new cases have been reported in Texas, along the Mexican border.To date, the cases reported in the United States have been limited to Florida, California, and now Texas. Dengue fever has not been reported in any other areas of the United States., If you think you have developed dengue fever, think about the areas you have visited in the past two weeks, or the area where you live.If you reside in the United States, the symptoms you are experiencing are unlikely to be dengue fever, unless you live in California, Texas, or Florida, have visited those states in recent weeks, or have traveled to one of the areas of the globe known to have the mosquitoes that carry dengue fever., The mosquitoes that carry dengue fever have unique markings.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is small and dark, and has white bands on its legs. It also has a silvery to white pattern on the body that resembles the shape of a musical instrument called a lyre.It may be that you remember being bitten by such a mosquito. If you can recall what the mosquito that bit you looks like, then that information can be helpful in confirming your diagnosis.

, While there is no specific treatment for dengue fever, the risks of developing bleeding problems caused by the infection warrant medical care.Most people get better in about two weeks with general supportive care., The most common methods of treating dengue fever is to take steps to allow your body to heal.Get plenty of bed rest.Drink lots of fluids.Take medicine to control your fever.Acetaminophen is recommended in treating your fever and the discomforts caused by dengue fever., Due to the risk of bleeding, aspirin products are not to be taken to treat the pain or fever associated with dengue fever.Ask your doctor about taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory agents. Medications like ibuprofen and naproxen can help reduce the fever and treat discomfort.
In some cases, ibuprofen or naproxen may not be appropriate if you are taking prescription medications that are similar, or if there is a reason to think you may be susceptible to GI bleeding these agents can sometimes cause.Follow the directions on the label of the product you are using. Do not take more than the amount recommended.
Talk to your doctor if you are taking any medications for pain, or agents that work to thin your blood, before you take additional over-the-counter products.

, Most people recover from dengue fever in about two weeks.Many people, especially adults, continue to feel tired, and somewhat depressed, for several weeks to months following an infection with dengue fever., If your symptoms persist or you develop any signs of bleeding contact your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care. Some symptoms to watch that are warning signs indicating your body may be having trouble maintaining the integrity of your blood vessels include the following:Persistent nausea and vomiting.Vomiting up blood or coffee-ground material.Blood in your urine.Abdominal pain.Difficulty breathing.Trouble with nosebleeds or bleeding gums.Bruising easily.Emergency medical care will likely result in hospitalization. Once you are hospitalized you will be treated with supportive care that can be life-saving.Examples of care that can be provided includes fluid and electrolyte replacement, and treatment or prevention of shock., Stay in contact with your doctor and report any changes you may experience as you recover from dengue fever, or if symptoms recur or worsen.


Your doctor will know how to intervene should your condition deteriorate into either dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome., If symptoms persist beyond seven days, involve problems with continued vomiting, vomiting up blood, severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, purplish areas under the skin similar to bruises, and continued problems with nosebleeds or bleeding gums, then you should seek immediate medical attention.You may be developing dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is a serious and life-threatening medical condition.If you develop those symptoms, then you are in a 24 to 48 hour window where your capillaries, which are the tiniest blood vessels in your body, become more permeable, or leak.The leaky capillaries allow fluid to leak from your blood vessels and accumulate in your chest and abdominal cavity, causing conditions medically termed as ascites and pleural effusions.Your body is experiencing circulatory system failure which leads to shock. If not immediately reversed, death is likely., If you are showing any signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, then you need immediate hospitalization and medical attention. This condition is life-threatening.Call 911 or get medical help the fastest way possible. This is a medical emergency.Dengue shock syndrome is recognized by early symptoms that include a decrease in appetite, continued fever, continued vomiting, and persistent symptoms associated with dengue fever.The maximum risk of shock is between the third and seventh day of illness.
If left untreated, internal hemorrhaging will continue. Symptoms of hemorrhaging include bleeding under the skin, persistent bruising and purplish rashes, worsening of symptoms, abnormal bleeding, cold and clammy arms and legs, and sweating.Symptoms like this indicate the person is in, or will quickly be in, a state of medical shock.Dengue shock syndrome can be fatal. If the person survives, they may experience brain disease, loss of brain function, liver damage, or seizures.Treatment for dengue shock syndrome will include controlling the loss of blood, fluid replacement, attempts to establish a normal blood pressure, oxygen, and possibly a transfusion to restore platelets and provide fresh blood to vital organs., Mosquitoes that carry dengue fever most often feed during the day, usually in the early morning and late afternoon hours.Stay indoors during those times, keep the air conditioning on, and keep screen doors and windows closed.
Travel during the times of day when the mosquitoes are less active., Wear full-bodied clothing.Even if it is hot, try to wear long sleeves, long pants, socks and shoes, and even work gloves, when you need to be outside during the times of day when the mosquitoes are more active.Sleep under mosquito netting., Products that contain DEET are reported to be effective.Other insect-repellant products that may be helpful include those that contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535., Mosquitoes that carry dengue fever are most often found close to dwellings.They like to breed in water that is held in artificial containers, like gallon drums, flower pots, pet dishes, or old tires.Get rid of any standing water containers that are not needed.Check for hidden sources of standing water. Clogged drains or gutters, wells, manholes, and septic tanks may have areas of standing water. Clean these areas or repair them so they no longer hold unwanted water.Eliminate containers that hold standing water around or near the outside of your home. Clean flower pot saucers, birdbaths, fountains, and pet dishes at least once a week to get rid of any larva.Maintain swimming pools and put mosquito-eating fish in small ponds.Make sure doors and windows have screens that fit tightly, and all doors and windows close properly."

Look for a high fever.,
Identify joint pain.,
Check for a rash.,
Check for additional symptoms.,
Call your doctor if you think you may have chikungunya fever.,
Treat the symptoms of the virus.,
Prevent chikungunya fever by avoiding mosquito bites.",How to Recognize Chikungunya Fever Symptoms," A high fever is one of the first symptoms of chikungunya. The fever typically ranges from 102 to 104 degrees °F (40 degrees °C). The fever will usually last for up to a week., It is often severe and disabling. It is usually bilateral (affecting both sides) and most commonly affects the hands and feet. The lower limbs and back are less common sites of joint pain. Joint pain can last weeks and may linger up to a year or more in some rare cases. The term “chikungunya” translates to “that which bends up” in the Makonde dialect of Tanzania, which describes the physical appearance of a person with severe clinical features of the disease.


In most sufferers the joint pain will last for seven to ten days, however in older patients it may persist for longer.Some people with also have swelling of their joints.

, The rash usually occurs after the onset of the fever and is usually maculopapular, which means it will appear as a flat, red area of skin covered with small bumps. It most commonly affects one’s torso and extremities. It can also appear on one’s palms, soles, and face., If you have chikungunya, you may also experience headache, muscle pain, conjunctivitis, nausea, and vomiting.

, If you have a fever, joint pain, and a rash, consult your doctor. As chikungunya is difficult to diagnose (and is often misdiagnosed as dengue fever), your doctor will make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, places you've traveled to recently, and by taking a sample of your blood for viral testing. The only way to truly confirm the presence of chikungunya fever, is through laboratory testing of blood serum or cerebrospinal fluid.


Blood testing for the virus is done at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a few state health departments. Tests normally take around 4-14 days to process. By this time, your body has already begun attacking the chikungunya virus., There are no antiviral drugs designed to treat chikungunya fever itself, however your doctor may prescribe medication to alleviate the symptoms. Your doctor will also advise you to get plenty of bed rest and to drink a lot of fluids to fend off dehydration.For example, fever and joint aches can be managed with acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve).Do not take aspirin because of the increased risk of Reye’s syndrome — a rare but serious condition that causes liver and brain swelling, especially in children and teenagers., Currently, there is no commercial vaccine for chikungunya fever. Therefore, the only way to prevent the virus is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, especially when traveling in areas where the disease is prevalent, such as Africa, Asia, and parts of the Indian subcontinent.If you are at high risk for complications, such as being pregnant or having other serious medical problems, try to avoid going to places with outbreaks if you can. To prevent mosquito bites:


Wear long sleeved shirts and and long pants when traveling in high-risk areas. If possible, treat your clothes with permethrin (a type of insecticide) to repel mosquitoes.
Use mosquito repellent on exposed skin, preferably one containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or paramenthane-diol (PMD), as these are the most effective and last the longest.
Make sure your living accommodations have tightly-fitted insect screens on windows and on doors. Sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net at night and use a net to protect young children and elderly people if they sleep during the day."

Don't travel to Asia.",How to Recognize Japanese Encephalitis Symptoms," Most people who have Japanese encephalitis have either no symptoms or mild, short-lived symptoms that are flu-like in presentation — mild-to-moderate fever, fatigue, headache and sometimes vomiting.As such, it's very difficult to identify most cases of Japanese encephalitis because it either causes no symptoms or mimics most other mild infections.


It's estimated that less than 1% of people infected with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) develop noticeable symptoms.In people who do develop symptoms, the incubation period (time from initial infection until signs of illness) is typically between five to 15 days.;
, Although most JEV infections produce mild or no symptoms, about 1 in 250 cases result in severe illness, which often starts with a severe fever.A severe fever is a defense mechanism by your body to slow down or stop the production of invading viruses (or bacteria), but when they get much beyond 103 °F (39.4 °C) in adults or 101 °F (38.3 °C) in children, there is a risk of brain damage. The high fever and increased inflammation in the brain caused by JEV trigger other serious and life-threatening symptoms.


Once significant symptoms develop with Japanese encephalitis, usually in children with weakened immune systems, the chances of dying are about 30%.Mild cases of Japanese encephalitis can increase your temperature by a couple of degrees, but severe cases spike it by five or more degrees.

, Like other types of infections that affect the brain and/or spinal cord (such as meningitis), a stiff neck can develop with Japanese encephalitisThe neck suddenly feels stiff and is difficult to move in all directions, but it generates especially sharp, shooting or electric-like pain with neck flexion (trying to touch your chin to your chest).


When the spinal cord gets inflamed, the muscles closest to the spine get very tight in efforts to protect it, which is called guarding or splinting. As such, the neck muscles will be hard to the touch and feel like they are spasming.
Medication, massage or chiropractic care will not resolve a stiff neck from Japanese encephalitis, meningitis or other infections of the central nervous system.

, Another effect triggered by brain inflammation and a severe fever is mental changes, such as disorientation, confusion, difficulty focusing and even the inability to speak.Behavioral changes are often interrelated and include irritability and/or poor temper control, as well as wanting to be alone and avoiding social contact.The more serious symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, once they begin, usually only take a few days or so to become significant and serious.
The mental and behavioral changes associated with severe JEV infection can mimic a stroke or Alzheimer's disease. The person will change from a healthy, functioning individual to one with severe mental and physical deterioration.
Realizing the signs and symptoms and getting prompt treatment are imperative to improving your chances of survival.

, Once Japanese encephalitis takes a turn for the worse with increasing swelling and high temperatures, the neurons in the brain start to get damaged and die off. Once this happens, neurological symptoms begin to become obvious, such as uncontrollable shaking of body parts (tremors), muscle weakness or paralysis, difficulty walking and grasping things, and reduced coordination (clumsy looking).Muscle weakness and paralysis usually starts in the limbs (arms and legs) and progressively spreads around the body, but the face can also be affected initially.
Of those who survive a severe bout of Japanese encephalitis (which is about 70% of cases), about 1/4 suffer permanent neurological and/or behavioral problems and disabilities., The progression of a severe bout of Japanese encephalitis invariably ends with seizures, which are triggered by brain swelling, high fever and electrical disruption/discharge in the neurons of the brain.The seizures involve collapse, shaking, muscle spasms, jaw clenching and sometimes vomiting or frothing at the mouth.


Seizures triggered by encephalitis can mimic those of epilepsy but can be far more life-threatening due to brain damage.
Children with encephalitis are much more likely than adults to have seizures because their smaller brains are more susceptible to pressure and increased temperatures.Once seizures begin, becoming unconscious and slipping into a coma is not uncommon.

, According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the safest and most effective form of prevention from Japanese encephalitis is getting vaccinated against it.The four main types of vaccines currently in use to prevent JEV infection are an inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine, an inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine, and a live recombinant vaccine. Get vaccinated at least six to eight weeks prior to your trip to Asia to allow your body enough time to build up protective antibodies.


The most widely used vaccine against JEV infection is the live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine made in China.The higher risk areas of Asia for Japanese encephalitis are the rural parts of Japan, China or Southeast Asia — get vaccinated before you go to these places to reduce your risk.
The Japanese encephalitis vaccination can require several doses over the course of a few weeks or months
Keep in mind that encephalitis can actually be caused or worsened by vaccination (any type of vaccine) due to an allergic reaction to the ingredients., Another form of protection against JEV infection is controlling mosquitoes and avoiding getting bit, as the insects are the main vector for the disease.As such, avoid or remove any sources of standing water where mosquitoes can breed and always use an insect repellent containing a chemical called DEET (Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, Ultrathon). In addition, sleep in beds with protective mosquito nets (or other coverings) and avoid going outside between dusk and dawn when more mosquitoes are active and airborne.


Most insect repellents last for up to six hours and some are water resistant.
DEET products shouldn't be used on infants younger than two months.
Natural forms of insect repellent include lemon oil and eucalyptus oil.
Preventing mosquitoes from biting you when traveling abroad will also reduce your risk of getting other serious diseases, such as malaria and West Nile virus.

, In addition to using insect repellent and mosquito netting, you should also wear appropriate protective clothing while traveling in Asia, particularly while in the rural countryside. As such, wear long-sleeved shirts and thin cotton gloves (popular in many Asian countries) to cover your entire arms and hands.For your legs, wear long pants with socks and shoes when you're outside, especially when walking in marshy or grassy areas.


Asia is very warm and humid for most of the year, so choose breathable pants and long-sleeved shirts so you don't get overheated.
However, keep in mind that mosquitoes can bite through thin clothing, so spray your clothes with insect repellent to be on the safe side. Don't apply insect repellents containing permethrin to your skin.

, If you're in Asia, avoid activities that significantly increase your risk of getting bit and infected by mosquitoes, such as outdoor camping, hiking and exploring on motorcycles or bicycles.Not only are these activities usually done in rural areas, but you're also vulnerable due to exposure. Choose sightseeing trips in enclosed vehicles (tour buses) while in rural areas and wear protective clothing, as noted above.


If you absolutely must sleep outside in rural areas of Asia, then it's essential to cover your tent or dwelling in mosquito nets that are impregnated with a strong insecticide.
While in the countryside, only sleep in hotel rooms with close-fitting gauze or screens over the windows and doors., Another form of prevention, albeit a drastic one, is to not travel to Asian countries that are known to be endemic for Japanese encephalitis — which is actually most countries in Asia. This is easy advice to follow for a curious traveler with no family ties or connections to Asia, but not practical for many people who must travel there for business or family reasons. In reality, the risk of getting infected is very, very small — it's estimated that less than one in a million travelers who travel to Asia develop Japanese encephalitis per year.More practical advice is to avoid the rural areas of Asia if you travel there, particularly farming areas that have lots of pigs and cows.
The people at greatest risk of JEV infection are those who live and work in rural areas where the disease is widespread, particularly children under the age of 15 years.If you have a choice, avoid traveling to Asian countries during their rainy seasons (it varies from place to place) when mosquito populations are larger and more of a threat.

Recognize lymphedema.,
Identify elephantiasis.,
Check for a swollen scrotum.,
Look for associated breathing problems.,
Know your risk factors.,
Remember that symptoms may not develop for years after infection.,
Get diagnosed.",How to Recognize and Prevent Lymphatic Filariasis1," Because the parasite infection damages the lymph system, the most common symptom is lymphedema – fluid buildup and swelling. This usually occurs in the leg or legs, but can also occur in one or both arms, breasts, and the genitalia.Lymphedema will make the affected area feel puffy, heavy, and swollen; sometimes pressing the skin will leave a small dent due to the fluid buildup. If you experience lymphedema, you should absolutely see your doctor; you can also try to minimize symptoms by:Elevating and exercising the swollen limb to improve the movement of fluids.
Washing the affected area with soap and water daily to avoid skin infections.
Using antibacterial or antifungal cream as needed, and properly disinfecting any wounds. Washing, disinfecting and using fungal creams are meant to reduce infection of the affected leg. The swelling decreases circulation to the skin, so there is more risk for infection.;
, With a poorly functioning lymphatic system it’s also harder for your body to fight infections. Bacteria can more frequently infect the skin, especially the damaged skin of areas suffering from lymphedema. Over time this causes hardening and thickening of the skin, known as elephantiasis.You can’t really prevent lymphedema, but you can try to prevent elephantiasis by warding off skin infections.Keep your skin clean and dry as much as possible and use antibacterial soap on affected areas. Wash your hands regularly. Keep any wounds or cuts in the skin clean and covered until they heal.

, Men infected with LF may experience swelling in the scrotum. This is also due to fluid buildup, and is called a hydrocele.Sometimes hydroceles can resolve on their own after several months.However, with a poorly functioning lymph system, it likely requires surgical treatment., A rare disorder that can be caused by lymphatic filariasis is called pulmonary tropical eosinophilia syndrome. This is a pulmonary disorder (i.e. it affects the lungs), and can cause a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing or gasping for breath.Those infected usually live in Asia. If you experience these breathing symptoms and have spent time in tropical climates, get tested for LF.
Pulmonary tropical eosinophilia syndrome can be diagnosed with a blood test. Blood will show high levels of eosinophils, a certain type of blood cell that increases when your body is exposed to allergens or parasites. You will also have high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and antifilarial antibodies., You are at the highest risk for infection if you spend a significant time (months to years) in a tropical or sub-tropical area where the disease is common (or endemic).The disease is present in over 73 countries in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific, and some tropical areas of the Caribbean and South America (Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Brazil).Tourists visiting these areas for short times have a low risk of infection, but it’s still best to take preventative measures and be aware of symptoms., The majority of people infected with lymphatic filariasis will never develop symptoms. However, a small number of those infected may start to have symptoms after being infected for years.Even if you haven’t lived in an endemic area for years, always consider lymphatic filariasis as a possible cause of symptoms associated with lymphatic dysfunction and severe swelling.


Because there are other more common causes of lymphedema, it is important to tell your doctor if you have traveled to endemic areas. Your doctor is unlikely to consider filariasis without you sharing your travel history.

, An infection with lymphatic filariasis will show up on a blood test if a doctor has the equipment to look for the worms under a microscope. The worms are sometimes nocturnal and only circulate in the blood at night, so the blood test has to occur from blood taken at nighttime.However, because symptoms might not occur until years after infection, some patients with LF will have a negative blood test. Other methods of diagnosing LF use blood serum to look for antibodies to the worms, which can be more accurate."
"
Avoid mosquito bites at night.,
Plan your outdoor activities for when the sun is up.,
Cover your skin with clothing.,
Use a mosquito repellent on exposed skin.,
Get medicated to avoid infecting others.",How to Recognize and Prevent Lymphatic Filariasis2," The worms that cause lymphatic filariasis are spread person-to-person through mosquito bites. Avoiding mosquito bites when in endemic areas is the best way to avoid infection, though it generally takes months to years of repeated bites to become infected.Protect yourself at night when mosquitoes are most active.


Obtain a mosquito net for your bed to limit the pests’ access to you while you sleep.If possible, sleep in an air-conditioned room with closed windows., The mosquitoes that transmit LF usually bite between dusk and dawn. When possible, limit your time outdoors in endemic areas to after dawn and before dusk – i.e. largely during daytime hours., As much as possible, wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks. Cover as much skin as possible to minimize areas for mosquito bites., Obtain a natural or chemical mosquito repellent and be diligent about using it regularly.Effective repellents usually contain either DEET, icaridin (or picaridin), or the oil of lemon eucalyptus.Apply mosquito repellent outside, away from food, and at least 20 minutes after putting on sunscreen if you’re using both.
Cover up any rashes, wounds, burns, or cuts before putting on mosquito repellent.

, Those actively infected with LF can take a yearly dose of a medication called diethylcarbamazine (DEC). This drug does not kill all of the worms, but it prevents you from spreading the disease to another person.


If you live in North America or another area where LF is not common, your doctor will have to get this medication from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other agency that deals with rare disorders.The medication is usually well tolerated, with minor possible side effects of dizziness, headache, fever, nausea, or muscle aches.Other treatment options are ivermectin and albendazole."

Know that all residents of areas where virus activity has been identified are at risk of getting West Nile Virus.

,
Take the following steps to help reduce your risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito.,
These infections were first reported in the United States back in 1999.,
However, WNV infections can be very serious if the virus makes its entry into the brain.,
There are several ways to avoid mosquito bites.,
It is advisable to use repellents whenever you go outdoors as mosquito bites can be expected at any time.,
Skin Armour is the home of one of the most effective and safe and long-lasting mosquito protection products available at the moment - Skin Armour Deep Woods Outdoor Soap.",How to Prevent West Nile Virus,",

Get rid of their breeding spots:






Empty excess water from flower pots.
Clean pet food and water dishes frequently.
Once or twice a week, clean out birdbaths, swimming pool covers, buckets, barrels, and cans.
Check for clogged rain gutters and clean them out.
Remove discarded tires, trash, and other items that could collect water.


Protect yourself and your family:






Consider staying indoors at dawn, dusk, and early evening, which are peak mosquito biting times.
Install or repair door and window screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering indoors.
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants outdoors (weather permitting).
Place mosquito netting over infant carriers when you are outdoors with infants.
Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. Choose a repellent that provides protection for the amount of time that you will be outside.
Spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent. Do not apply repellents containing permethrin directly on your skin.



, WNV infections do not lead to any noticeable symptoms or any symptoms at all. Those infected may show a fever, headache, skin rash, body aches, or swollen lymph glands as symptoms.;
, It may give rise to encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, inflammation of the tissue that is seen around the brain and spinal cord. People aged above 50 are at an increased risk to WNV disease. The fact that no effective medication has been found so far to treat this disease makes prevention of WNV disease extremely important. The most advisable way to prevent WNV is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

, Using insect repellents is a very effective way among them. Realizing the increased threat posed by mosquitoes scientists from around the world have worked tirelessly to find some powerful mosquito repellent formulations. It is advisable to use repellents that are based on natural ingredients as they do not cause any adverse effects on your health. Repellents make you less attractive to mosquitoes and make you resistant to mosquito bites.

, Clearing up standing water is another very effective way to get rid of mosquito bites. Look around your home for standing water holders and empty them instantly. The period between dusk and is when mosquitoes can be most expected and so, stay indoors during this period or even if you go out, do so only after adequate application of repellents. Also, ensure your window and door screens are not giving any space for mosquitoes to enter your home.

, A combined effort from the researchers in Australia and China who have worked extensively over the last decade to find a competent mosquito protection product resulted in this product. Skin Armour Deep Woods Outdoor Soap is a completely natural product made from a group of powerful natural oils."

Know that there are several forms of leishmania infection.,
Be aware of who is at risk of contracting the infection:


Anyone who lives or travels where leishmaniasis is found.,
Know the signs and symptoms of the infections:



Cutaneous leishmaniasis.,
Be aware that the skin sores of cutaneous leishmaniasis typically develop within a few weeks or months of the sand fly bite.,
Know that (in the U.S. particularly) treatment of the infection will be decided by your doctor and CDC staff.",How to Recognize Leishmania Infection Symptoms," The most common types include:



Cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores.

Visceral leishmaniasis, which affects internal organs, such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.;
,
Anyone who is out from dusk to dawn in areas where the sand flies are located (the flies are more active at these times).
Missionaries.
Soldiers.
People who study birds (ornithologists).
Eco tourists.
Peace Corps volunteers.
People who do research outdoors at night/twilight.

, Look for:
One or more sores on the skin. Sores will change in size and appearance.
Sores with a raised edge and centralized ulcer or covered with a scab.
Swollen glands near the sores (i.e, if the sore is on the arm or hand, the armpit may be swollen).



Visceral leishmaniasis. Look for:
High fever.
Unexplained weight loss.

Start by paying off your debts.,
Investigate ways of saving money while traveling.,
Think of ways to earn a living on the road.,
Have as many income streams as possible.,
Get a plan ‘B’.",How to Fund a Nomadic Lifestyle," Before you set off on your camping odyssey of a lifetime you will need to start from a level playing field. This means paying off your debts. There are many tools out there to help you and many schemes available to help take control of your personal finances so you can start planning how you might be able to afford your dream.;
, Camping and traveling can get quite expensive (no surprises there!). There are lots to think about, but with extra planning there’s always money to be saved. The best approach is to take each type of expense and look at ways of reducing them from the very start.


Campsite fees stack up quickly but schemes like Britstops, Camp in My Garden and France Passion allow you to pitch up for free or for a minimal amount around the UK and Europe, with similar schemes around the rest of the world.
Diesel isn’t getting any cheaper but you can investigate ways of making bio-diesel for half the price.
Seasonal farm work allows you to trade a day of labour for enough vegetables, milk and bread to keep you going for a few days. Very handy if you want to keep to a limited shopping budget. A useful website for this is Gumtree.
If the farm schemes aren’t available go foraging. A lot of food can be found in the hedgerows or fields but make sure you have a good book with clear pictures to guide you about safe foods to harvest.
If you’re brave enough you can hunt and fish for your tea, so make sure you have the right gear before setting off.
Many people go dumpster diving behind supermarkets, which often throw out perfectly good food, but there are obvious risks to this activity.
Think about guerilla gardening when you visit towns and cities, and keep your eyes open for vegetables growing in public places.
Before setting off think about renewable energy. Not only is it good for the environment but if invested in early it will leave you with a continuous supply of electricity and an added benefit of being able to wild camp for free.
If you need to buy equipment for your journey or replace it while you’re on the road, think about visiting recycling areas, car boot sales, charity shops and pre-loved websites that sell goods at a fraction of mainstream shop prices.
If you need to access the Internet there are plenty of cafes, libraries and pubs you can visit with free wifi.

,


Before you leave take stock of your skills and experience. Any skill in demand can be useful but it’s important that you build an image of trust for whoever may want to use your expertise.
Have professional business cards and a resume with references to hand.
If you think a particular skill would be useful to you, then get the training before you set off.

, A nomadic life camping and traveling can be tough, and funding it can be even tougher. But the best way to stay strong is to have a number of fiddles to your bow, to diversify and to have a varied portfolio. In other words, it’s important to have as many income streams as possible, so when one dips another one will hopefully take its place.



Find a Job. A temporary job or local seasonal employment may be all you need to keep your bank balance healthy. There are even websites that target people living full time in an RV and looking for work.

Entertain. Can you play music, or do you have an entertaining act up your sleeve? There are many jobs available to those who can entertain and make people happy. As you will often be working with children it is always advisable to have a certificate from the Criminal Records Bureau to hand for any potential employers. Alternatively you can simply busk or play music or perform acts in town centres and at festivals. However, you may need to get permission from the land owner or local council to do this otherwise you may be moved on.

Write. There are a number of ways you can make a living if writing is your thing. You can:

Become a freelance writer and sell your work as you travel.
Set up a blog. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme, but if done properly it can produce a steady income. However, as there are so many elements to making money through a blog and ways it can be done the best thing to do is start from the beginning and invest in a training programme from an expert that can help you on your way quickly.
Produce and sell access to an online magazine about a subject you specialise in. Some VW Magazines that have got it right are AirMonkeys and Aircooled Classics.
Publish and sell an instructional book or fictional story as an eBook. A brilliant independent publishing house for this is Smashwords. It’s free as they only take a small percentage of your sales so there’s absolutely no up front fees. If you don’t like the idea of just offering electronic books then you can organise paperback books, with no upfront fees at Lulu.
Write reviews for places you visit or products you use. These don’t earn much but if you get in the habit they can help pay the bills, but make sure you note the point below.
Surprisingly enough you can be paid for filling out surveys too. Be warned though there are a few rogue sites doing this so be careful and make sure you do your research before handing any personal or payment details over.



Sell your photographs. Are you good at taking pictures? Have you ever thought of selling them? Rather than spreading them for free all over Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter (who may sell them on your behalf and not give you a percentage), you may want to sell them through a stock agency instead. The most popular are Shutterstock, Fotolia and iStock Photo.

Teach. If you have a knack at getting your point across think about teaching while you are on the road. There are many schemes such as TEFL that allow you to get paid very reasonable fees to teach while on the road.

Build an app. With the development of mobile devices apps have never been in such high demand. However, don’t be fooled into thinking you need to be a computer programmer to do this. All you actually need is a great idea. Then with investment in an app developer this could help you bring in a very nice regular income.

Sell your skills online. If you have a skill then you can guarantee that someone, somewhere will want to pay you money for you to help them out. It may be graphic design, article writing, web design, office skills, photography, business advice, crafts, gifts, etc. The key is making the connection with the person who wants your skills or needs your expertise. This is where websites such as 99Designs, Etsy and PeoplePerHour can help out.

Sell your products online. If you have a product that can be easily sold while you are on the road, then websites such as eBay and Amazon are perfect for bringing in a regular income. The key is to set it all up before you go on the road so you have less to think about when your Internet access isn’t as reliable as you would like.

Be creative. If your roadtrip is interesting enough with a lot of positive outcomes, it may be an interesting concept to start a Kickstarter Project. This is where projects can request donations for funding.







, Thinking of how to fund a nomadic lifestyle is only a small part of getting on the road. Being a nomad isn’t for everyone. Neither is camping full-time, even if it is in a VW campervan, RV, motorhome or luxury Airstream caravan. It’s important to be prepared about what life on the road will actually mean, and what you’re plan ‘B’ is if it doesn’t work out for you.

Have a few glasses of water.,
Eat a small piece of dark chocolate.,
Try a small snack, like almonds or an avocado.",How to Feel Less Hungry1," Water can pass through your digestive system very quickly, but it can still help decrease your appetite. Sip water and stay hydrated throughout the day to keep your stomach from feeling empty and your hunger levels down.You can also try drinking hot water with lemon and cayenne pepper. Cayenne pepper can help to suppress your appetite and help your stomach stay settled and feel full.As an alternative to water, have some hot ginger tea. Ginger is a proven digestive tool, and can help to settle your stomach if you are suffering from hunger pangs. Sip hot ginger tea or chew on crystalized ginger.;

Have a breakfast high in fiber and protein.,
Get eight hours of sleep a night.,
Cut down on your alcohol consumption.,
Schedule your meals.",How to Feel Less Hungry2," Consuming more fiber, especially in the morning, will add bulk to your diet and make you feel full for longer. Fiber stays in your stomach longer than other foods, so you will have a sense of being full and less hungry during the day. Protein can also help keep you feeling satisfied, and it suppresses the hormone ghrelin, which signals your brain it is time to eat.Try oatmeal with peanut butter or wheat toast and an egg.


You can also add flaxseed to your breakfast cereal, your yogurt, or your morning smoothie. Flaxseeds are high in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids and can be ground in a coffee grinder or a food processor to then add to foods.
Omega-3 fatty acids can also suppress your appetite by triggering the production of leptin, which can lead to feelings of satiety., Being sleep-deprived can lead to anxious snacking and overeating. A good night’s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night., Most alcohol can make you hungry and lead to overeating. If you are of age, enjoy a glass of wine or beer at the end of your meal, instead of before or during the meal. This way you will be drinking on a full stomach and be less likely to be hungry later or end up wanting to snack late at night., Look at your daily activities and try to schedule your meals for the same time each day, with about three to four hours between them. Eating at the same time each day can help prevent swings in the hormones that control appetite.Try to keep healthy, portioned snacks in your purse or backpack in case your meal is delayed and you need a snack.

Focus on a hobby.,
Socialize with friends.,
Do light exercise.,
Write in your journal.,
Solve a problem or complete a chore.",How to Feel Less Hungry3," One study found that a stationary activity, like knitting or crocheting, can help you stop obsessing about food. Focus on a simple hobby you enjoy doing, like gardening, sewing, or even painting. Using a hobby as a distraction can lead to improvement in your skills or abilities and a shift in focus., Don’t keep your hunger pangs to yourself. Instead, call up a friend and go for a walk together or go see a movie. Focus on spending time with friends or family, instead of on your hunger.Schedule a routine meet up with a friend during a diet so you have a guaranteed distraction for a certain day and time. This may help to motivate you to get through the day without succumbing to hunger and give you something to focus on instead of your grumbling stomach.

, Take a walk around your area or go for run or jog to help you unwind and re focus. According to researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, exercise strengthens your brain’s powers of executive function, including your ability to think ahead and control your inhibitions. This will then make it easier to stop thinking about your hunger pangs.Try taking up a yoga class. Yoga can help you deal with temptations and be a more mindful eater.

, Focus your thoughts on the events of the day or a list of ongoing goals you keep in your journal. You may also want to record your eating habits and the times of day when you feel hungry, as well as how you feel emotionally during these times. Writing down your eating habits will help you distinguish when you’re feeling physically hungry and when you’re feeling emotionally hungry.Physical hunger usually has symptoms like a growling stomach or lightheadedness. Emotional hunger is when you want to eat but you do not feel physically hungry. Writing down your emotions towards food will help you identify your triggers and prevent them from happening.
For example, you may find you get hungry in the afternoon, when you begin to get bored with your work and are looking for a snack. You may then want to change up your routine, like exercising or going for a walk in the afternoon, to prevent emotional eating.

, Be proactive with your time and complete one item on your to do list. Or look over any chores you can do at home and get them done. Rather than reach for food, reach for the broom, the duster, or the sponge and do your dishes or clean your bathroom."

Encourage healthy eating at home.,
Take an active role in what the government is doing to encourage healthy eating in schools.,
Volunteer to organize a health program that parents can be involved in.",How to Encourage Healthy Eating in Schools1," If parents and children eat a well-balanced, healthy diet at home, then children are more likely to follow that example at school.


Talk to children about food and nutrition. Explaining which foods are nutritional and why each meal of the day is important helps children understand, which helps them make better decisions when the parents are not around.
Go over the school food menu with children. If children don’t like something, they will usually state it. By going through the menu, the children have a chance to give feedback on what is being served. Parents can use this feedback and pass it on to the school food service director. Parents can also use this feedback to address common myths around school food and as a last option, they can work with their children to create healthy sack lunch alternatives that meet the child’s expectations.
Keep fruit available for snacks in a visible location. Children will eat what they have access to and so will parents. Having the fruit out is a reminder that it is there and ready. Fruit also has more fiber to help satiate between meals. This can also help decrease unhealthy snacking;
, School meals are regulated at many different levels of government. The county regulations may differ from the state, and the state regulations often differ from the federal when it comes to school meals. If a school participates in the national school lunch and breakfast programs, then it must meet the requirements to receive aid from the federal government. These requirements include serving the proper amounts of healthy foods for each meal. The school still needs to meet state and local requirements as well, which are often more strict than the federal guidelines. Unfortunately, the regulations can vary greatly from one school district to another and that is why it is important to know the regulations and get involved.


Get involved with Let’s Move. Let’s Move is the federal government’s program to encourage healthier children. The program has many resources to educate. They also have groups throughout the U.S. made up of concerned parents that get together to help in their local communities. The Let’s Move groups can be found on meetup.com and parents can join a local group for free.
Correspond with local congress representatives’ on why healthier eating in schools is important and find out how they are helping. Letting the local congress representatives know that healthier eating in schools is important will open their eyes to a topic that needs to be addressed. Many schools lack funding to purchase the best food choices and many of the money made from school lunches goes to other programs in schools, not back into school meals. Without people supporting the cause for healthier eating openly, schools will continue to face this cost issue and be less able to bring the best foods to children.

,


The health program can sample new menu items and put together student focus groups to get feedback on what schools should serve.
The health program can also run contests that make nutrition fun and reward students for their efforts.
Promote school lunch by working with the food service professionals. Many school food service directors welcome volunteers. Chefs are welcome in school kitchens because they help create new menu items. Food service directors are also always looking for ways to raise participation and become more profitable.
Organize fundraisers. Since many fundraisers target parents, it is easier to sell healthier foods and healthy lifestyle items, such as whole grain foods and small exercise accessories. When adults support these types of fundraisers, they can teach their children by example.

Choose a health coordinator for the school.,
Establish a nutrition curriculum.,
Create a newsletter that contains the school food menu and also related articles on nutrition that will go home to parents.,
Take field trips to the cafeteria.,
Allow the students to snack on healthy items during mid-morning and mid-afternoon.,
Institute reward-based health programs.",How to Encourage Healthy Eating in Schools2," If it is a large school, more than one may be needed.


The health coordinator can work with the students on personal habits. This can involve BMI monitoring and evaluating eating habits to help establish healthy goals.
The health coordinator can also have a hand in preparing short lessons in nutrition that will relate to school meals. The lessons can coincide with the lunch or breakfast menu and be taught by teachers or cafeteria staff.
Have the health coordinator evaluate school meals for nutritional content and suggest changes if needed.

, This can be incorporated into existing or new health and physical education programs.


Create nutrition handouts that feature different topics that can relate to a topic students may already be learning about.
For young students, teach colors with fruits and vegetables.

, This can help build parents confidence in the food at school and educate the whole family.

, Letting the students explore where the food is made and see the food being prepared can be rewarding for the food service workers and peak the students interest to try more food at school.

, Also, take a stretch break or physical activity break. The movement and food will boost energy and help the students focus better in class.

, The federal government sponsors the Healthier US School Challenge that establishes health standards for school meals, nutrition education and physical activity. This program offers incentives, resources and assistance to schools that participate. Schools can start their own programs as well.

Join the EmpowerMe movement through the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.,
Eat school lunch.,
Create a student-based food focus group that helps evaluate the school food menu, new items and snacks.",How to Encourage Healthy Eating in Schools3," This program is for middle and high school students. This program teaches students the skills to bring about positive changes by working with the administrators and cafeteria staff and teaching fellow classmates about nutrition and healthy eating habits.

, School lunch provides a nutritious meal for students. Supporting the school lunch program helps schools continue to be able to feed students properly throughout the day. Students can set an example by trying new things when offered.

, The feedback a student-based focus group provides is very valuable to school food service directors. The students help make decisions and the school provides better food the students like so everyone wins.

Compare measured servings to your hands.,
Think of your favorite sporting items.,

Eat a 1 or 2 cup serving of dairy.,

Split restaurant items.",How to Estimate Portion Size," One easy way to estimate portion sizes of foods is by using your hands. Since it's a part of your body, it's a very convenient measuring tool even if you're out at fancy restaurant.However, everyone’s hands are different, so practice measuring out portions first and compare them to your hands to get an idea of what they should look like. Use these guidelines when trying to estimate a portion size:


2 cups will fit into your hands if they were cupped together. This should generally be the size of your total meal.
1 cup or 8 oz is equivalent to your fist. If you have large hands, your fist might equal 10 oz or slightly more than a cup.
1/2 cup or about 4 oz is the size of one cupped palm.
3 oz is about the size of your palm.
1 tablespoon is the size of the tip of your thumb.
1 teaspoon is the size of the tip of your pointer finger.;
, If you have larger hands or want to use other objects to help give you a better visual of portion sizes, try using some of your favorite sporting items.Try:


2 cups will be about the size of a softball.
1 cup or about 8 oz is the size of a baseball.
1/2 cup or about 4 oz is the size of a tennis ball.
2 tablespoons is the size of a golf ball.
1 oz is the size of 4 dice.

, Another way to help you see not only what portion sizes you should eat, but how they should fit into your entire meal, is by using the plate method.Divide a 10 inch plate so that:


A quarter of the plate is reserved for protein-based foods.
Another quarter of the plate should be left for starch-based foods.
The remaining half of the plate should be divided between fruits and vegetables.
Note that fruit shouldn't make up a full half of the plate. At most it should be about a quarter of the plate. Vegetables, however, can be the entire half of the plate.

, To improve your ability to estimate a portion when you see it, practice portioning it out at home. Use measuring cups and a food scale to measure out various types of food portions for your meals for one week and pay attention to what the portions look like. Then, measure out portions for one day each week to help calibrate your ability to recognize portion sizes., Each food group comes with its own recommendations on portion size. Protein-based foods, even nutritious ones, still need to be measured and portion controlled.


In general, if you're measuring or eyeballing protein-based foods, aim for about a 3-4 oz or about a 1/2 cup portion per serving.If you're estimating this portion size, this will be one small palm full, the size of your checkbook or about the size of a deck of cards.
For example, 3-4 oz of chicken, pork or fish is a serving and one and a half to two eggs is a serving.
Nuts, although a protein-based food, are higher in fat and come with a smaller serving suggestion. If you're eating nuts, measure out 1 oz of nuts per serving.
In general, adults should aim for about two 3-4 oz servings of protein-based foods each day.

, Dairy is a food group that contains a high amount of protein. However, dairy products are still separated into a different food group and have different serving size recommendations.


When you're having a diary based food, serving sizes can vary. Measure 8 oz of liquid dairy and between 1-2 cups of other forms of dairy products.
For milk and yogurt, the serving size is 1 cup. If you're eating cottage cheese, the serving size is 2 cups. If you're going to have cheese (like cheddar cheese), the serving size is 2 oz.If you're estimating these portion sizes, 1 cup of yogurt will be about the size of your fist and if you're measuring cheese it'll be the size of a golf ball for a piece, or the size of a CD for a slice.
In general, adults should aim for about 3 cups of dairy each day. This does not include high fat dairy options, such as ice cream and butter.

, Vegetables are a nutrient dense food group that's low in calories and high in vitamins, fiber and antioxidants. Although these foods are very healthy, you still should estimate your portion sizes.


Vegetables are divided into two different groups - dense vegetables and leafy green vegetables. In general, estimate 1 cup for the denser vegetables and 2 cups for those leafy green vegetables.
Denser vegetables like broccoli, peppers or beans should be measured at 1 cup. However, if you're going for salad greens like kale or romaine, you should measure out 2 cups per serving.
In general, adults should aim for about 3 cups total of vegetables each day.

, Fruit, like vegetables, are another very nutritious group. And although they are also lower in calories and high in nutrients, they still need to be portion controlled.


There are a few ways to measure fruit depending on what form it's in. If you have a whole piece of fruit or cut fruit your portion will be a 1/2 cup. It should be about the size of a tennis ball or computer mouse.If you're having dried fruit, the portion is smaller. This is because the water has been evaporated out of the fruit leaving behind a higher sugar dried fruit.
The portion size for dried fruit is about a 1/4 cup. This is equivalent to two golf balls or about the size of an egg.
In general, adults should aim for about 2 cups of fruit each day.

, There are a few ways to measure grains depending on what form they're in. Make sure you account for what you're eating when you're estimating portion sizes.


In general, you only want to eat about 1 oz of grains per serving. If you're eating foods like rice or pasta, your portion size will be about a 1/2 cup.For example, if you're eating pasta, you want to eat a 1/2 cup serving which will be about the size of a tennis ball. However, if it's uncooked, you want to go by ounces instead.
Other 1 oz serving examples include: 1 slice of bread, 1/2 of an English muffin, 1/2 cup of cooked oatmeal or 1 cup of unsweetened cereal.
In general, adults should aim for about 5-7 one oz servings of grains each day.

, Although not a food group per say, fats also come with recommended portion sizes. These are essential since fats are high in calories.


In general, it's recommended to have no more than 6-7 teaspoons of fat each day.Note that when you're measuring or estimating the portion size of fats, the recommendations are given in tablespoons. There are 3 teaspoons per tablespoon.
If you were going to drizzle olive oil over a salad, the recommended serving size is 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml). Or if you were going to spread mayo on your sandwich, one serving of mayo would be 1 tablespoon. This is about the size of your thumb.

, If you're trying to focus more on portion sizes, you need to go beyond just estimating portions of your foods. When you're shopping or eating packaged goods, serving information is provided which can give you additional guidance on how much to eat.


Packaged foods, like cereal, crackers, soup or salad dressing, will have the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list on the side of the product. This is where you will find the serving size information.Look at your food product and find the nutrition label. The serving size is listed at the top left of the label.
The label will provide the serving size in two measurements. It might list a cup measurement, ounces or pieces. It'll also list the serving in a gram amount as well.
The label will also tell you how many servings the entire package or container contains. This is helpful if you need to eyeball a serving.
For example, if a tub of yogurt says it contains 3 servings, it might be easier to just guess what a third of the tub is, rather than trying to remember what 1 cup looks like.

, Estimating portion sizes can be difficult (especially if you're new at doing this). If you're using a large plate, this can make portion sizes seem smaller than they are and lead to more inaccuracies in your estimation.Studies have shown that if you eat off of a typical size dinner plate, which can be 12 inches (30.5 cm) or even bigger, you're more likely to overeat. It looks like there is less food on a bigger plate which makes it tempting to overeat.
Even if you're using your fist to estimate portion sizes, the extra space on the plate can trick your eyes.
Instead of those typical dinner plates, use a salad plate or appetizer plate instead. They're smaller and can make an appropriate serving of food look larger than it is.

, Another easy way to make sure you're sticking to an appropriate portion size is by eating pre-packaged items. Let the store do the work for you.


If you have difficulty estimating correct portion sizes, try purchasing more pre-packaged or individual items. They're already pre-portioned for your convenience.
For example, instead of buying a larger container of yogurt and estimating what 1 cup looks like, purchase the individual yogurt cups. No estimating required.
You could also buy pre-sliced cheese instead buying cheese in a block. They're already sliced into the correct portion size.
Note, not all pre-portioned items provide one serving. Always check the nutrition panel to see how many servings are per container. If it's more than one, you should account for eating more than 1 serving.

, Measuring your foods everyday, 3 meals a day can get difficult and frustrating. Make life easier by doing the work one time only.


If you have bowls, cups or silverware that you use on a regular basis, you can measure them ahead of time to know exactly how much these items hold.For example, if you love soups, measure out your ladle. Your ladle may hold a 1/2 cup. You know that if you give yourself two ladles of soup, your total serving will be about 1 cup.
If you bring lunch to work on a regular basis, measure out your to-go or tupperware containers. For example, you might have a big tupperware for your lunch-time salads. Measure out how many cups of salad actually fit in there.

, Many of the times you'll need to estimate a portion size is when you're eating out. Most people aren't going to bring their food scale or measuring cups, so estimating will be a must.


Most restaurants are serving portions of food that are much larger than recommended. In addition, many people are ordering an appetizer, larger entree and even dessert. This makes the overall portion size of the meal overly large as well.To help cut down on these sneaky big portions, start splitting items. If you split an entree, you're automatically cutting down the portion size and getting closer to an appropriate serving.
You can also try ordering an appetizer for your main meal as well. Appetizers are generally smaller and most likely closer to a normal portion size.
You may even want to choose to order items a la carte. For example, get a side salad and order a grilled chicken breast to go on top.

"
Recognize your individual “eating pattern.” While it still contains plenty of specific dietary recommendations, the newest version of the dietary guidelines does not want you to focus on simple ""good food"" / ""bad food,"" ""eat this"" / ""don’t eat that"" rules.,
Identify the five guidelines that should inform your eating pattern.,
Shift your existing eating pattern.,
Seek inspiration from sample eating patterns in the guide.,
Get colorful with your vegetable choices.,
Focus on eating a range of whole fruits.,
Choose a variety of lean proteins.,
Target low-fat dairy and whole grains with your choices.,
Understand the new guidance on added sugar.,
Keep cutting back on saturated fat and processed meats.,
Stay vigilant with your sodium consumption.",How to Follow the Newest Dietary Guidelines," Instead, it recommends that you first identify your individual “eating pattern”; this term is defined as “the combination of foods and drinks you consume over time.”Essentially, it is asking you to focus on the “big picture,” the overall eating habits and behaviors that you will carry throughout life. Day-to-day variations are not as important as adjusting your long-term patterns to better meet the general nutritional guidelines.;
, The five general principles that introduce the new dietary guide build off this concept of eating patterns, along with familiar points of emphasis. According to these overarching guidelines, you should:Establish healthy eating patterns throughout your lifetime.
Consume a variety and sufficient amount of nutrient-dense foods.
Limit caloric intake from added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.
Emphasize healthier beverage as well as food choices.
Support healthy eating patterns for all people.

, Instead of adding or deleting specific foods, the new dietary guidelines recommend that you shift your existing eating pattern to better reflect the recommended nutritional breakdown for your age, sex, and activity level. For the typical American diet, these shifts include:Eating more vegetables and fruits. Try to eat half of your meal plate from vegetables.
Making whole grains at least 50% of your grain intake.
Focusing on low-fat, nutrient-dense dairy products (for instance, lowfat yogurt, not cheese)
Adding more variety and nutrient density to your protein choices.
Consuming comparatively more oils and fewer solid fats.

, Much of the information is tucked away in the appendices of the official Dietary Guidelines, but it is worth seeking out the comparisons of three recommended eating patterns. These include the “Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern,” “Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern,” and “Healthy Vegetarian-Style Eating Pattern.” You can draw from any or all of these in order to develop your improved, personalized eating pattern.The U.S. pattern accounts for a typical American tendency for higher animal protein and dairy consumption, for instance.
The Mediterranean pattern, meanwhile, adjusts for the increased intake of seafood and fruits, and reduced dairy intake common to eating patterns in that part of the world.
Similarly, the vegetarian pattern adapts to the typical increase in soy, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains as a result of the elimination of animal proteins.

, While the specific guidelines vary by age, sex, and activity level, you should typically seek to eat at least 2.5 cups of vegetables daily. Really, though, you would be hard-pressed to eat too many vegetables. They are chock-full of essential nutrients and tend to fill you up faster, thus reducing your overall caloric intake.One of the specific guidelines regarding vegetable variety is to pick from a range of colors, because they provide different beneficial nutrients. Of particular importance are dark green (like broccoli or kale), red (like peppers and tomatoes), and orange (like carrots and peppers). Basically, eating lots of vegetables is always a good thing, but the more colorful your salad bowl or veggie stir-fry is, the better. Eat a rainbow of colorful food.

, As with vegetables, the recommended amount varies based on individual circumstances, but you should typically eat around two cups of fruit daily. “Eat” is important to note, as it is the recommended way to consume fruit. Eating whole fruits is preferred to drinking fruit juice, for example.By eating whole fruits, you get the maximum benefits out of the range of vitamins and nutrients available. A whole apple, for instance, will provide you with significantly more fiber than apple juice. The Dietary Guidelines also emphasize variety in fruit choices, in colors and types.

, When it comes to protein consumption, variety is once again a key element of the new guidelines. Both meat-eaters and vegetarians can choose from a wide range of foods that pack a protein punch. Seafood, poultry, lean meats, eggs, legumes, soy, seeds, and nuts all offer good sources of protein without significant saturated fat content.Typically, you should eat eight ounces or more of seafood per week, for instance. For more examples of recommended amounts and varieties of lean proteins, see the appendices at the end of the official Dietary Guidelines.Eggs are now more highly recommended in the newest guidelines, because previous limits on daily cholesterol intake (previously 300 mg per day) have been removed. Research has indicated a weak correlation between eating cholesterol-heavy foods and increased blood cholesterol levels. Eggs, therefore, high in protein (and cholesterol) but low in saturated fat, are back “in.”, The new guidelines are more specific on the importance of choosing whole grains, recommending that they make up at least fifty percent of your total daily grain intake. Whole grains possess a more complete nutritional profile than refined, processed grains, and offer more fiber content, to name a few benefits.The guidelines also specify that dairy selections should focus on nutrient-dense options that have no fat or reduced fat content. Fat-free, unsweetened yogurt, for instance, provides protein, calcium, and a host of nutrients without saturated fat or added sugars.

, For the first time, the official Dietary Guidelines make a specific recommendation on limiting your consumption of sugars that are added to foods, as opposed to those naturally occurring in fruits, for instance. While there is no nutritional difference between naturally-occurring and added sugars, the latter makes up a significant majority of the average American’s overconsumption of sugars.The guidelines state that less than ten percent of your total daily calorie intake should come from added sugars. For a 2,000 calorie diet (recommended daily calorie amounts vary by age, sex, and activity level), that equates to about 50 grams of added sugars per day.
For sake of comparison, eight ounces of soda contains about 27 g of added sugars, so it is quite easy to see how many of our “eating patterns” include significantly too much sugar. Excess sugar intake can cause a host of health problems, not limited to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay. Try to incorporate zero calorie drinks with low or no sugar in them like Coke Zero, Pepsi Max, Power Aid Zero, and Vitamin Water Zero.

, Previous versions of the Dietary Guidelines have sharpened the differentiation between “good” and “bad” fats, and the newest version continues that trend. While unhealthy trans fats have largely been removed from processed foods because of changes in federal regulations, excessive saturated fat intake is still a major health problem for many people.Similar to added sugars, the guidelines recommend that no more than ten percent of your daily calorie intake should come from saturated fats. Saturated fats are found in abundance in red meats, whole dairy products, and processed foods; always check packaged food labels.
Processed meats like deli cuts, bacon, and sausages tend to be high in saturated fat and sodium, and groups like the World Health Organization (in 2015) have deemed them to contain carcinogenic compounds that should not be consumed. The new U.S. Dietary Guidelines edition does not preach avoidance of processed meats or set a specific maximum intake, but it does recommend that their consumption be very limited., Excessive salt intake has become an increasing concern of nutritionists and health experts in recent years. There is ample evidence that too much sodium consumption can cause hypertension (high blood pressure) and, by extension, a host of significant health problems. If you are like the typical American, you consume far beyond the recommended amount of sodium. As with sugars and saturated fat, the main culprit is processed foods.An average adult should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, which equates to about one teaspoon. Again, the vast majority of most people’s sodium intake comes not from the salt shaker, but from prepared, packaged, and processed foods. Always look at labels, and adjust your eating patterns to include more fresh, minimally-processed foods.

Immature ticks (nymphs) are the size of poppy seeds while mature adult ticks are the size of sesame seeds.Ticks are small, almost impossible to see until they get on your skin. To avoid contact with them, avoid areas where they live. Ticks are found in the same kind of environments no matter what part of the world they are in. They love shady, damp wooded areas with a lot of brush and leafy plants. Rotting leaves, tall grasses, piles of wood, and rock walls provide safe, covered environments where ticks like to live.


Ticks will wait in these areas until they can make direct contact with an animal or person.
Ticks are not only found in the woods. There are plenty of places in your backyard, especially if there is any tall grass, brush, bushes, or other shaded places for them to hide.;
, It is very important to know peak tick seasons, the times of year when infected ticks proliferate. Infected ticks are most prevalent in the spring and summer (May through September in the northern hemisphere). Knowing this should help you to be prepared.For example, if you plan camping trips or garden parties during peak tick season, you can take extra precautions to prevent tick bites.

, When you and your children leave the house and you know that you might be in areas where ticks live, you and your children should wear long pants when walking in grassy and wooded areas. If possible, the bottom of the pants should be tucked inside the socks. Most ticks are picked up on the lower leg area.You and your children should also wear long-sleeved shirts, gloves and hats.This helps to ensure that all body surfaces are covered and that ticks cannot gain access to the skin. AGAIN, tucking pants into socks prevents ticks from being able to crawl up your children's legs.
Wear light-colored clothing. It is easier to see ticks on light-colored clothing.

, Children should wear insect repellent on the skin when they are in an area that is, or could be, infested with ticks. The repellent should have a minimum of 20% DEET, which is the active chemical ingredient that repels ticks and other insects.Apply insect repellent on your children's skin, taking care to avoid eyes, mouth, and hands. Reapply every 2-5 hours, depending on the product.You don't want to repellent to be ingested BECAUSE it has a toxic chemical. Make sure you follow the directions on the container of repellent carefully.
Products containing permethrin can be applied to clothing. It is also possible to buy clothes that have been pretreated with permethrin. Permethrin is a chemical repellent that is available in local drugstores. It kills ticks and insects that come into contact with it. This chemical is only registered to be used on clothing and not on skin. Follow directions for use on the packaging carefully. If unsure, contact your doctor for proper usage.If you prefer a natural repellent, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) is a natural tick repellent derived from eucalyptus trees. OLE has a distinctive odor and repel ticks as effectively as a low-concentration (10%) DEET product. This natural repellent can also repels mosquitoes and other insects. You can usually find OLE at your local drugstore.Other essential oils, such as citronella, cedar, soybean, or eucalyptus, are not shown to be very effective against ticks., To avoid Lyme disease, avoid tick bites all together. Encourage your children to stay on the trails and avoid walking in areas that are bushy or have long grass, BECAUSE, AGAIN, these are areas where ticks are most prominent., Clear your yard to keep it tick-free. Clean your backyard at least once a year to keep it free of ticks. This includes clearing leaves and bushes because, AGAIN, ticks love these environments. Keep grass trimmed and short, clear away loose, dead, and decaying leaves, and keep all wood piles elevated off the ground so ticks cannot hide in them.For an extra layer of protection if you live near the woods, build a three-foot-wide mulch, gravel, or wood chip barrier between your lawn and surrounding forest to help prevent tick invasion.
You can buy special chemicals that are used for tick control in the yard to keep ticks away.Bifen IT, Onslaught, and Permethrin Pro are professional grade chemicals that kill ticks and other insects in your yard.Be sure to use these only in the way specified on the container, especially since they are harsh chemicals that can be harmful to you, your family, and your pets if the directions are not followed.
Pesticides called “acaricides” can keep ticks out of your yard. You will need to hire a licensed applicator, who will usually apply pesticide to the area twice a year. This is not something you should attempt to do on your own., Deer are the main source of food for adult deer ticks. If you keep deer away, the chances of getting Lyme disease are reduced because the deer ticks will not hang around your yard. Do this by removing plants (clovers and peas) that attract deer.You can build a physical barrier against deer, such as a fence.

, When your children return home from an activity where they may have come into contact with ticks, you need to perform an inspection as soon as possible. A tick inspection is an examination of the entire body to search for any ticks that may be on your children's skin. Make sure to check extra carefully in the areas most frequented by ticks -- under the arms, in the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, between the legs, in and around all hair, and all around the waist.You can use a handheld mirror to inspect areas that would otherwise be difficult to check., When your children get home and after a tick inspection is done, you should instruct them to shower immediately. Ticks usually remain on the skin for some time before they attach themselves more firmly. This makes it possible to wash them away before they become attached and bite, which can prevent the transmission of Lyme disease.Ticks may also attach themselves to pets, so if you walk your dog through any long grass or bushes, you should give them a wash with warm water as soon as possible after getting home.
In general, deer ticks will not survive longer than 24 hours without feeding, although ticks on damp clothing can survive up to 2-3 days., After arriving home from a walk or camping trip, wash your family's clothes to remove any ticks that may have attached to them. Make sure to wash the clothes with plenty of hot water and laundry detergent.This will ensure that the tick detaches from the clothes and dies during the wash., Even if you have followed the necessary precautions, ticks are small and might be missed in the first inspection. The ticks can become attached to the skin if they are left on the skin long enough and if they do not wash off in the shower. Because they are easy to miss, it's a good idea to conduct another thorough visual exam to check your children for ticks., The possibility of Lyme disease from a tick bite increases the longer the tick remains attached to your child. Any ticks that have attached to your child's skin should be removed immediately. If you remove the tick within 24 hours of its original attachment, the chance of getting Lyme disease is decreased., Use rubbing alcohol to disinfect your child’s skin around the area where the tick is attached.You should also sterilize the tweezers by wiping them with rubbing alcohol.

, Using a clean pair of tweezers, gently grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. This will help ensure that you remove the tick’s head and mouth as well. Pull the tick upward and away from the skin steadily and carefully. Do not twist or yank it. Pulling it quickly could rip the body away and leave the mouth parts of the tick behind.Avoid crushing or squeezing the tick. This helps to prevent the possibly toxic fluid in the belly of the tick from entering your child's bloodstream.
Avoid using a lit match or petroleum jelly to remove a tick or to try to kill it.These methods will only cause the tick to burrow deeper into the skin and release its saliva, which increases the chance of Lyme disease. They are not effective tick-removal methods.
If you find that some of the tick still remains in the skin after removal, don't worry. It's not possible for the tick to survive with just part of its body embedded. The rest of the tick will eventually come out in much the same way as a splinter., Do not dispose of the tick. Instead, once the tick has been removed, kept in a sealed container. You need to give it to your doctor so she can test it to see if it is a Lyme disease carrier.Although helpful, this is not necessary, so don't worry if you can't keep the tick. This is not as high a priority as taking care of your children when they are bitten. If you have to destroy the tick to get it off of your child, do it. Removing it is the top priority.

, In order to remove any residual toxin released by the tick, you need to clean your child's skin. It is best if you use antiseptic or any other antibacterial cleaning agent. Wet a cloth or cotton ball with antiseptic and gently wipe the affected area.If the area becomes irritated where the tick bit your child, swab the area with antibacterial ointment such as Neosporin to ensure it doesn't get infected.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after you have cleansed your child’s skin.

, If your child gets bitten by a tick, you should take him to the doctor. If he is infected, confirming the presence of Lyme disease will allow him to receive the necessary treatment as quickly as possible.


Even if you couldn't keep the tick, your doctor will still be able to diagnose your child either way.

, There is a certain time frame during which Lyme disease symptoms will appear. When your child is bitten by an infected deer tick, signs of Lyme disease can appear anytime within a time range of three days to a month. The first signs of Lyme disease will usually manifest between 3-30 days after the bite at the site of the wound.After your child gets bitten, watch his skin around the initial tick bite closely for 3-30 days for any warning signs., The first symptom to appear will likely be the characteristic skin rash known as Erythema migrans (EM). EM appears like a reddish spot with a circular or oval shape at the site of the bite. This rash tends to expand over time, causing the spot to resemble a bull’s eye because it forms a reddish pink circle that surrounds a patch of clear skin area with another reddish center.This characteristic rash shows up at the bite site in the early stages of the disease, usually after about a week.However, with the gradual spread of the infection within the blood stream, it can show up at various locations over the body., In addition to the rash, the skin around the tick bite may start to have feelings of pain or itchiness. The EM rash shows up in about 70-80% of all Lyme disease cases. The rash may feel warm, but pain, burning or itchy sensations are also symptoms, although they are rarer.In more serious cases, the rash doesn't appear at all. This is dangerous because the infection continues to spread within the bloodstream without any visible signs. This serious type affects other vital organs without the victim being aware that anything is wrong.
Lyme disease can also affect the joints, the heart, or the nervous system.If you notice the EM rash, take your child to the doctor immediately., In addition to the EM at the early stages of Lyme disease, patients can develop some flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, general fatigue, enlargement of the lymph nodes, and chills.If you notice the EM accompanied by flu-like symptoms, take your child to the doctor immediately for treatment.

, If your child has been bitten by a tick, you need to watch his behavior carefully. He may not be able to describe what he is actually feeling, so watch him for the warning signs.Common behavioral signs include:lack of concentration
difficulties sleeping at night,
inability to focus on studies
dizzy or confused feelings
joint pain
recurrent fevers
increased sensitivity to light or noise

, There are some symptoms of Lyme disease that do not appear until the late stage of the disease. When Lyme disease is in its later stages, the bacteria is spread to other body locations, which can result in serious problems with many vital organs. These later stages can cause severe problems with the heart, joints, and nervous system.


Affected joints can develop arthritis, which manifests itself by inflammation accompanied by a degree of stiffness, pain, swelling, and narrowing of range of motion.
If the heart is affected, your child can develop myocarditis, which is the inflammation of the heart muscles.
If the nervous system is affected, the child can develop neuropathic pain, which manifests as fatigue, muscle weakness, tingling and burning sensations in the peripheral nerves.When left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure or meningitis., The treatment of Lyme disease requires killing the causative bacteria responsible for the infection. The treatment also has to control all the symptoms that appeared and try to prevent any complications or spread of the infection in order to protect the vital organs.Treatment starts first with administering the proper antibiotics. These are only obtainable by a physician and the proper course of the medication will be laid out by the doctor.


She will likely prescribe your child additional medications to control any symptoms.

, If you recognize the symptoms of Lyme disease, you must take your child to the doctor immediately. Your pediatrician will prescribe antibiotics to fight and kill the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.The doctor will determine the best antibiotic type depending on the patient’s age and the state of the Lyme disease.


Generally for children, oral antibiotics will be enough to stop the infection and suppress the characteristic rash. Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics for a week or two as an initial treatment period, which has been found to be enough for the majority of cases to cure the rashes. It is common for doctors to suggest your child continue using antibiotics for another two weeks to achieve complete destruction of Lyme disease.
Antibiotics chosen are usually broad spectrum like Augmentin, which is Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, that is available in many dosage forms to be suitable for different ages. You can also get oral suspensions that are suitable for younger children starting from the age four., If you child is showing signs of late stage Lyme disease, antibiotics through injection is preferred to give a faster response. This direct injection results in faster absorption, which helps the medicine start working and cure it faster. It also helps to prevent or to cure other serious complications such as arthritis.Available injections include brands such as Rocephin (Ceftriaxone) that can be given to children with the concentration of 0.5 mg. These can be injected directly into your child's muscle or vein as a single daily dose.The doctor will observe your child for a period to see if the antibiotics are curing the disease or if he has not responded to the medication. If this happens, the antibiotic type can be changed by the doctor.

, Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed by doctors for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. These medications also help suppress pain or fever as well as reduce any inflammation and rash that has developed. The medicine relieves the swelling and the warmth sensation at the affected skin spots.


These are commonly prescribed by your doctor when arthritis pain is one of the complications of the child’s Lyme disease.Read the instruction on all over-the-counter medications and note any special instructions for child doses. If you are unsure, ask your doctor.
You can buy NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Children’s Advil, Children’s Motrin), Catafast sachets, or Cataflam suppositories (Diclophenac Potassium), which are available as syrups, suppositories, or sachets. Your doctor will give the right prescribed medication according to the child’s age.
Do not give children under 18 aspirin, as it has been linked to the development of Reye’s syndrome, a rare but dangerous condition in which the liver and the brain swell., Although they will not cure Lyme disease, topical anti-itch applications such as creams or gels can be applied directly at the rash spots to prevent your child from scratching them. These ointments relieve the itching or burning sensation in the affected areas. The soothing effect can calm the whole skin area, helping to suppress the painful itchy sensation.Consult your doctor before applying any creams to your child’s skin.
You will still need to use antibiotics to cure the Lyme disease. Anti-itch ointments only relieve symptoms.

Become Superman.",How to Exercise for a Flat Stomach1," Your “core” includes your abdominal, lower back, and pelvic muscles. Your core is separated from your chest muscles by your diaphragm, which helps you breathe. In addition to protecting many vital organs inside your abdominal cavity, your core muscles are also responsible for helping your move the main portion, or trunk, of your body. They also affect your posture, balance and stability.Your core muscles are extremely important and should always be included as part of a well-rounded exercise routine.The core is one of the widest used sets of muscles in your body and yet, it is one of the muscle groups that many tend to forget to train regularly.;
, Most core exercises can easily be done without any equipment or weights, and in the comfort of your own home. During each exercise you should try to focus your attention on the deepest abdominal muscle you have, which is called the transversus abdominis. This is the same muscle that tenses when you cough, so you can do some fake coughs to help you locate and focus on it.Perform the exercises on the floor, either on a mat or a carpet.
Remember to breathe deeply throughout each exercise — don’t hold your breath.
When first starting out, repeat each exercise five times. Once you’ve had some practice, and are ready, increase the repetitions to 10–15.
Stop exercising any time you feel in pain or have severe discomfort.

, Lie on your back, with your knees bent. Keep your arms flat on the floor beside you. Keep yourself in as neutral a position as possible, tighten your abdominal muscles, and lift your hips and bum off the ground. You want to lift your hips until they are completely aligned with your knees and shoulder, then hold yourself in this position as long as you can., Lie on your back and place your feet against a wall such that your knees and hips are at 90 degree angles. Focus on your transversus abdominis and tighten all your abdominal muscles. Raise your head and shoulders off the ground while your arms are crossed over your chest. Hold for three deep breaths and relax., Lie on your back with your knees bent. Keep your back in a neutral position and tighten your abdominal muscles. Raise your right foot off the ground until your knee is at a 90 degree angle from the floor. Push your hand against your right knee while using your abdominal muscles to push your knee towards your hand. Don’t bend your arm. Hold this for three deep breaths then relax. Do this exercise on both your left and right sides during each set of repetitions.Instead of putting your right hand on the front your of your right knee, put it on the outside of your right knee. Push your right hand against your right knee while pushing your right knee — outwards — towards your right hand.Change this exercise up a bit by using your right hand on your left knee instead. Push your right hand against your left knee, from the inside, while pushing your left knee against your right hand. Hold for three deep breaths and then relax.

, Try the double-leg abdominal press once you’re comfortable with the single-leg abdominal press. Lie on your back with your knees bent. Keep your back in a neutral position and tighten your abdominal muscles. Raise both legs off the floor until your knees are at a 90 degree angle. Push both hands against each knee while pushing each knee against your hands. Hold for three deep breaths and relax.An alternative is to place your right hand on the inside of your left knee, and your left hand on the inside of your right knee. Your arms will be crossed in front of you. Push outwards with your hands while pushing inwards with your knees.Yet another alternative is to place your left hand on the outside of your left knee, and your right hand on the outside of your right knee. Push inwards with your hands while pushing outwards with your knees.

, This is actually referred to as a “segmental rotation” and you start by lying on the floor with your knees bent. Keep your back in a neutral position and tighten your abdominal muscles. While keeping your shoulders flat on the ground, let your knees fall slowly to your right. You should be able to lower your knees far enough to feel a stretch, but not to the point of discomfort. Hold for three deep breaths then return to the starting position and rotate to the left side., Put your hands and knees on the ground — with your hands directly below your shoulders. Keep your back straight and align your head and neck to your back. Raise your right arm off the floor and reach it forward. Hold you arm for three deep breaths then relax. Do the same thing with your left arm. Then raise your right leg off the ground and try to bring it up to align with your back. Hold your leg for three deep breaths then relax. Do the same thing with your left leg.To add an extra layer of fun, do the same exercise but raise your right hand and left leg at the same time. Hold them both for three deep breaths then relax. Repeat with your left hand and right leg.

, Lie on your stomach, then raise yourself slightly until you’re resting on your forearms and knees. Your elbows should be directly below your shoulders. Your head, neck, and back should be aligned. While in this weird position, tighten your abdominal muscles and “push” your knees and elbows towards each other (without actually moving your elbows or knees). Hold for three deep breaths and relax.An alternative to this exercise that adds an extra challenge is to raise your right arm instead of “pushing” your knees and elbows together. Hold your right arm up for three deep breaths, then relax. Repeat the same exercise with your left arm. You can also try the same thing with your legs instead of your arms.If you’re really looking for a challenge, try this exercise while raising your right arm and your left leg. Hold them both for three deep breaths, then relax. Repeat the same movement with your left arm and right leg.

, Don’t be disappointed if you have trouble doing this exercise at the start; it’s not easy. Start by lying on your left side, then slowly raise yourself until you're resting on your left forearm. When you’re in this position your elbow should be directly below your shoulder. Your shoulders, knees, and hips should be in alignment. Your knees should not be bent. Hold this position for three deep breaths, then relax. Repeat the same exercise on your right side.To increase the challenge, lift yourself up until your resting on your left hand, instead of your left forearm. This will raise almost your whole body off the ground, except your feet. Reach your right hand towards the ceiling, with the palm facing forwards. Hold for three deep breaths, then relax. Repeat the same exercise on your right side.

, Yes, there is an exercise called the “Superman!” You’ll want to lie on your stomach with a towel or small cushion under your hips. Both arms should be stretched before you, and both legs should be stretched out behind you — like you're Superman! Raise your right arm off the floor and hold for three deep breaths, then relax. Repeat the same thing with your left arm. Then raise your right leg off the ground and hold for three deep breaths. Repeat with your left leg.Feel free to play the Superman theme song in your head while doing this!

Hire a personal trainer.",How to Exercise for a Flat Stomach3," Pilates is a type of exercise routine that includes increasing your flexibility, strength, and endurance. Pilates focuses almost completely on your core muscles. While there is pilates-related equipment available, it is not required for most of the poses. All you really need is a floor and a mat.Pilates classes are offered in a variety of settings, including through many local gyms, YMCAs, and city-run exercise programs.YouTube is also a good source for Pilates if choosing to work out at home, as many certified fitness instructors teach Pilates in their videos.

, Yoga is an interesting set of exercises in that it’s designed to help both your body and your mind. While many of the poses help with flexibility, balance and strength, they can also help with your stress levels and blood pressure.You can easily find yoga instructions on the internet through various websites and videos, or even apps that you can download to your tablet and smartphone. However, if you’ve never done yoga before, or it’s been a while, you may want to consider joining a class.
Yoga classes can be found at dedicated yoga studios, local gyms, the YMCA, and elsewhere., Tai Chi is a set of exercises based on self-defense that blend together into one fluid motion that was developed in ancient China. It is very much like mediation, except that you’re moving. Tai Chi requires you to focus your breathing and motions together to perform the various poses.It can help with decreasing your stress and anxiety, build up your aerobic abilities, improve your energy, stamina, balance, flexibility, and agility, and can build muscle strength.


Tai Chi should be offered at a number of places in your community, including some local gyms, city recreation programs, and even senior centers., If you’re really serious about the flat stomach, and you have sufficient funds, you may want to consider hiring a personal trainer.


Most personal trainers will have been certified by one of many certifying bodies (such as the American Council on Exercise (ACE), the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA), and others).Most personal trainers work through health centers and local gyms, which means you will also require a membership to whatever place your personal trainer works from.Many cities offer personal training options through their city-wide recreational programs and centers."

Eat the recommended daily servings of each food group every day.,
Determine what your caloric intake should be per day.,
Plan your meals in advance.,
Aim to eat the right kinds of fruits and vegetables.,
Ensure at least half of your grains are whole grains.,
Consume lower fat versions of milk products.,
Buy lean meats and more meat alternatives.",How to Exercise for a Flat Stomach4," For the purposes of planning a diet, food is divided into four groups — vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives. Your gender and age will determine exactly how many servings of each group you will need each day. You can see the recommended number of food guide servings per day, per gender and per age group here.


Abdominal muscles are mostly impacted by your diet. Remember that a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains and healthy fats is essential to creating a killer stomach.
A “serving” differs depending on the food group and the type of food.Examples of one serving of fruits or vegetables are: 1/2 cup of juice, 1 cup of raw vegetables, or 1 piece of fruit.
Examples of one serving of grains are: 1 slice of bread, 1/2 a bagel/pita/tortilla, 1/2 cup of cooked rice or pasta, or 30 grams of cold cereal.
Examples of one serving of milk products are: 1 cup of milk, 3/4 cups of yogurt, 50 grams of cheese.
Examples of one serving of meat products are: 3/4 cups of cooked beans, two eggs, two tablespoons of peanut butter, or 1/2 cup of cooked fish, chicken or other lean meat.

, Healthy eating includes the recommended daily servings, regardless of the number of calories you’re aiming to eat. Which items you select from each food group to meet your daily requirements will differ depending on whether you're trying to maintain your weight, gain weight, or lose weight.Remember that if your abs are covered by a layer of fat, you will not see them no matter how many exercises you do. You need to lose that body fat.


If you want to maintain your weight, you need to eat as many calories as you burn every day.
If you want to gain weight, you need to eat more calories than your body burns every day.
If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less calories than your body burns every day.
To lose 1 pound of body fat, you need to consume 3,500 less calories than you burn. The healthy way to do this is over the course of a week, at minimum. This means you want to eat 500 less calories than you burn every day.
Use a journal to keep track of everything you eat, so you can determine the number of calories you’re currently eating every day.

, In an ideal situation, you should plan all your meals in advance so you can ensure you’re meeting all your recommended daily servings of all the food groups. Planning ahead also allows you to know exactly what you need to buy at the grocery store, helping you to avoid browsing and buying unhealthy items.If you’re trying to lose weight, your planning process could also include calorie calculations for each meal, and each day.


If you’re able to plan in advance, you might also be able to do some prep or cooking in advance too. You could save yourself a lot of time later in the week by doing this.

, To help you decide what fruits and vegetables to eat everyday, plan to have at least one dark green vegetable (i.e. broccoli, spinach, romaine lettuce, etc.) and one orange vegetable (i.e. carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, etc.) per day. When shopping for processed fruits and vegetables, buy the ones made with little or no added salt, sugar, or fat. Steam, bake or stir-fry vegetables, rather than fry them. Stay away from fruit juices as much as you can., When buying grain products, whether at a grocery store or a restaurant, try to select the whole grain or brown version when possible. Many products such as rice, pasta, cereal, and breads come in a whole grain variety. When selecting grain products, also aim to eat those low in fat, sugar and salt, when possible.The same concepts work if you’re baking grain products yourself. Choose whole wheat or other types of whole grain flour. Use recipes that call for lower amounts of salt, sugar, and fat.

, Most milk and dairy products come in “regular” and “low-fat” versions. Drink skim or 1% milk — and try to drink at least 2 cups of milk every day. Also consider buying milk that has added vitamin D. Use lower fat cream cheese, sour cream, and cottage cheese. Look for low-fat yogurt, and those made without added sugar., The meat food group doesn’t include just meat. But when you do eat meat, try to buy the lean versions, or trim the extra fat from your meat before you cook it. Roast, bake, or poach your meat instead of frying it. Select the low-salt versions of processed meats, like those you’d buy for sandwiches. Eat at least two servings of fish every week. Consider adding more meat alternatives to your diet, such as beans and tofu."

Stay away from places where ticks are likely to be.,
Wear protective clothing when going outdoors.,
Protect your skin from ticks with repellent.,
Get ticks off clothing before going indoors.,
Check your skin for ticks after being outside, especially in areas with large tick populations.,
Remove any ticks you find.,
Learn the symptoms of Lyme disease.,
Also.",How to Prevent Lyme Disease,"
There are numerous places where ticks thrive in different parts of the world.


Contact your the department of health to find out which outdoor spaces near you have tick problems.
Avoid places with lots of woods, forest, bushes and grass, especially from late spring-mid summer when ticks are most active.
Stay away from overgrown walking trails if possible.;
,


Bright/light colored clothes will make it easier to spot ticks.
Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Tuck in your shirt, and if possible, tuck your pant legs into your socks. If you are going to spend a great deal of time in a place where ticks are likely to be present in large numbers, use tape to seal the line where your pants meet the socks. This will help prevent the ticks from getting in.
You may want to treat your clothes with permethrin. Permethrin will kill any ticks that land on treated clothes. Impregnated permethrin usually lasts a few washings. Do not apply permethrin directly to skin., The CDC recommends using an insect repellent with at least 20-30% DEET on skin and clothing. Make sure that all exposed areas are treated, and repeat treatment as needed.However, a lot of people are against the use of DEET as it is a very strong chemical and it should never be used on children. Other methods for tick protection include:

, Wash and dry clothing using high heat levels to kill any ticks that you may not have found., In addition to exposed skin, check protected areas such as the groin, armpits and scalp.

, Use tweezers to carefully remove the tick. Do not use any irritants such as a match, nail polish, petroleum jelly, or other products to remove the tick. Contact your physician after being bitten by a tick to see whether you should take an antibiotic after being bitten by a tick. This is usually not necessary, but may be recommended by your doctor in high-risk cases., Since you may not always be aware of tick bites, it is a good idea to be able to recognize the Lyme disease symptoms. The symptoms of Lyme disease vary from one person to another.

, it can help to wash your hair, face, and hands as often as you can. When you get shampoo and soap into your skin, the ticks will fall off quicker than they normally would.

Determine whether you're at risk.,
Schedule a doctor's appointment.,
Get a prescription for malaria pills.,
Take the medication as prescribed.",How to Prevent Malaria1," If you're traveling to a country with high rates of malaria, it's important to take precautions. Malaria is preventable if you take the right medication before, during, and after exposure to dangerous mosquitoes. The following regions are high-risk:Africa
Central and South America
Parts of Caribbean Asia, Eastern Europe, and the South Pacific;
, If you are visiting one of these places, schedule an appointment with your doctor six weeks in advance of your trip.Start your trip planning early so you can start taking preventative medication before you set out on your journey.
As an alternative to your regular doctor, you may schedule an appointment at a travel clinic in your area., Talk to your doctor about where you are traveling. He or she can then provide a prescription for medication most effective against malaria in that area.


These medications may include Chloroquine phosphate, quinine sulfate, or tetracycline. The type of medicine differs according to where you're going, so it's important to mention every place you'll be.There is no vaccine for malaria. Instead, your doctor will prescribe the same type of medicine used to treat malaria. You'll take it the entire time you're at risk of exposure.
Make sure to discuss your other medications and health conditions. These could affect which prescription you're given. For example, you shouldn't take some malaria medicines while pregnant. Others shouldn't be used by people with certain psychiatric conditions.
Your doctor or travel clinic attendant should also check whether there are any other diseases that are a risk.

, The important thing to remember is to follow your prescription exactly. Malaria drugs are only effective when taken as indicated.


You need to start some pills at least two weeks in advance of your trip. Others can be started just one or two days beforehand. Some you'll need to take once a day, others several times per day.
If you must take a malaria pill once a day, take it at the same time every day.
Keep taking the pills for the entire time recommended by your doctor. In many cases you'll need to take the pills for a week or more after leaving the high-risk area. If you do not do this, you may still be at risk of contracting malaria.
Follow instructions to prevent harm from side effects. For example, some malaria pills (doxycycline) make you more prone to getting a sunburn. In this case, be sure to use sunscreen to protect your skin.Resistance to antimalarial medications is an increasing problem. Strains of the disease can become resistant if people overuse malaria pills, or if they do not finish the full course of medication.Take the full course as prescribed."
"
Choose your accommodations carefully.,
Use a mosquito net.,
Keep doors and windows closed.,
Wear long pants and sleeves.,
Use mosquito spray.,
Stay inside between dusk and dawn if possible.",How to Prevent Malaria2," When planning your trip, try to choose places to stay that have fewer mosquitoes. If possible, stay in screened quarters or quarters with air conditioning.


In general, the best areas to stay in are cooler areas away from any stagnant water. Stagnant water serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
Stagnant water sources such as lakes or non-running streams are especially prone to mosquitoes.

, Mosquito nets are lightweight, tightly-woven nets that keep mosquitoes out of your tent or bed at night.Set the net up over your sleeping area each night before you go to sleep. You can also use them to cover any open windows or doors.


Since you may not be able to find a mosquito net where you're going, buy one to take with you when you travel.
Get dressed inside your mosquito net in the morning.
Make sure to check it regularly for tears. You might want to bring an extra net as a backup.
Buy mosquito nets treated with permethrin for the best protection., If possible, you should keep doors and windows tightly sealed while you're indoors.


People who sleep outside or are exposed to the outdoors at night are at much higher risk of contracting malaria.
You may not be able to close the doors and windows if you're in a very hot, muggy place. Whether you can or not, use a mosquito net over your bed for added protection., You'll reduce the number of mosquito bites you get if you wear long pants and sleeves while you're out and about during the day.


Bring high-quality lightweight clothing that will allow your body to breathe while protecting you from bites., Choose the mosquito spray that's most effective in the area where you're traveling. Talk to your doctor about your options and to get recommendations. If you have children, consult their pediatrician about what types and strengths are safe for use on children.


In almost all areas where malaria is present, DEET is the most commonly used compound. DEET is a chemical compound known as N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, or just diethyltoluamide. This repellent comes in many different concentrations, from 4% to 100%. However, concentrations over 50% do not provide meaningful added protection.Apply the spray to your clothing and the room where you're staying for best results.Combining insect sprays with permethrin-treated clothing and gear offers the best protection.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of DEET. Read them carefully before using this product. Improper usage can lead to health problems., Try to plan activities that permit you to be in protected areas between dusk and dawn. The mosquito that transmits malaria is most active at night."
"
See a doctor if you experience symptoms.,
Get treatment.,
Continue monitoring your health after travel.",How to Prevent Malaria3," If you feel sick during or after travel and are worried you were exposed to malaria, see a doctor right away. It's important to get treatment as soon as possible. Early malaria symptoms are generally non-specific,but may include the following:High fever
Shaking chills
Profuse sweating
Headache
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, The medication your doctor prescribes will depend on where you contracted the disease. Other factors, like pregnancy, are also important. Treatment usually means a strict course of medication for an extended period of time.Drugs used to treat malaria include the following:Chloroquine phosphate is the first-line medication for malaria unless there is resistance to the drug. This issue has become common, so your doctor may prescribe something else.
Doctors prescribe quinine sulfate and tetracycline in areas with high chloroquine phosphate resistance. Alternatively, your doctor may prescribe atovaquone-proguanil and mefloquine.
Sometimes, the infection may require an infusion of medication intravenously. If infected with the parasite P. falciparum, you may take IV quinidine and doxycycline.
If the malaria is caused by either the parasite P. vivax or P. ovale, your doctor may prescribe a two-week regimen of primaquine phosphate.
Again, early prevention is the best way to protect yourself before arriving in high-risk areas. If your doctor knows you are traveling to a chloroquine-resistant region, he or she may prescribe mefloquine.

, See a doctor right away if you experience flu-like symptoms that could be symptoms of malaria. Even if it’s been awhile since you’ve returned, you could still be at risk.


Most cases of malaria become obvious within about two weeks of contracting the disease. But, in some cases symptoms show up much later. The parasite that causes malaria can lie dormant in the body for weeks, months, even up to a year."

Understand how dengue fever is transmitted.,
Consider your risk factors.,
Stay indoors or under a mosquito net during peak mosquito times.,

Stay hydrated.,
Reduce pain.",How to Prevent Getting Dengue Fever," Dengue fever may not cause any noticeable symptoms if it is a mild case. In more severe cases, symptoms will start about four to 10 days after you have been bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms of dengue fever include:High fever (up to 106°F or 41.1°C)
Headache
Muscle, bone, and joint pain
Pain behind your eyes
Rash
Nausea and vomiting
Bleeding from your nose and gums (rare);
, The Aedes mosquito is the main type of mosquito that spreads dengue fever. Mosquitoes become infected with dengue fever by biting an infected person. The dengue fever is then transmitted to someone else when an infected mosquito bites that person.The virus is active in the blood of the infected person from day one to seven of the fever phase; therefore, anyone who might be in contact with infected patient's blood (such as a doctor or other heath care worker) can be exposed.
Dengue fever may spread from an infected pregnant mother to her fetus, so extra care should be taken by pregnant women in areas where the virus may be present., If you live in or travel to a tropical or subtropical region often, you are at a higher risk of contracting dengue fever. You are also at greater risk of contracting dengue fever if you have been infected before. A previous bout of dengue fever also puts you at risk of developing severe symptoms if you are infected a second time.Many tropical countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, the South Pacific, the Caribbean, South and Central America, northeastern Australia, and Africa. After 56 years of absence, dengue has also resurfaced in Hawaii., The dengue mosquito has two peak periods of biting activity: in the morning for several hours after daybreak and in the late afternoon for several hours before dark. Nevertheless, the mosquito may feed at any time during the day, especially indoors, in shady areas, or when it is overcast.Make sure that you sleep indoors in a screened or air conditioned building or that you sleep under a mosquito net (or both).Make sure screens do not have holes or any openings.

, It is important to protect yourself from mosquito bites when you will be spending time outdoors in mosquito infested areas. Apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of your skin before heading outside.For adults and children over two months of age, use a repellant that contains 10% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide).Protect infants less than two months of age by using a carrier draped with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit.

, You can reduce your chances of being bitten if you cover up as much of your skin as possible. Wear loose, long-sleeved shirts, socks, and long pants when you will be traveling to mosquito infested areas.You can also spray your clothing with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent for greater protection. (Remember: don't use permethrin on skin.), Mosquitos breed in standing water. Mosquito breeding sites include artificial water containers such as discarded tires, uncovered water storage barrels, buckets, flower vases or pots, cans, and cisterns. Help to reduce the mosquito population in your area by getting rid of any standing water that has collected around your house or campsite., If you develop a fever after visiting a region where dengue fever is common, seek medical attention right away to increase your chances of survival. If your symptoms become severe, you may require blood pressure monitoring, blood transfusions, and other interventions that must be administered by medical professionals., Although multiple vaccines are being researched, there is no cure for dengue fever. If you survive the illness, you will be immune to the strain with which you were infected; however, you will still be able to contract one of the other three strains., Dengue fever can cause diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause dehydration; therefore, it is important to drink plenty of water if you contract dengue fever. Your doctor may administer IV fluids to keep you hydrated as well., Acetaminophen is recommended for pain associated with dengue fever because it can help reduce your fever as well. Acetaminophen is also less likely to increase bleeding than NSAID pain relievers. Bleeding can occur if you develop severe symptoms of dengue fever."

Notice the symptoms of malaria.,
Know where malaria occurs.,
Wait for symptoms to manifest.,
Diagnose malaria.,
Watch out for cerebral malaria.",How to Know if You Have Malaria1," There are some common symptoms that occur when you contract malaria. You may have some or all of these symptoms at some point while you are sick. The symptoms include:


High fever that ranges from 101 to 104°F (38.3 to 40°C)
Chills and involuntary chills, called rigors
Headache
Sweating
Disorientation about your identity and location
General confusion
Body aches
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, which occurs due to busted blood cells;
, There are parts of the world where malaria is common, known as malaria-endemic countries. These countries include most of Africa except the most northern and southern areas, northern and central areas of South America, India and the surrounding areas, and many of the Pacific Island nations. Malaria is also present but not endemic in most of Asia, parts of central South America, western Mexico, and most of Central America.


Although malaria is endemic in these countries, it is less common in areas that are high in altitude and in desserts, except in oases. It is also less common during colder temperatures.
In areas near the equator, it is hot year round, which means malaria is more concentrated and you can contract it all year long., The incubation period, or time before the symptoms appear, is typically seven to 30 days from the time you get bitten by the infected mosquito. Certain types of the malaria parasite can lay dormant and not cause symptoms for up to four years after you get bitten. The parasite remains in the liver but eventually invades the red blood cells., You can be diagnosed with malaria no matter where you are. There are doctors that know and can recognize the symptoms all over the world. To get diagnosed, a single drop of blood will be taken and evaluated under a microscope. The doctor will check for the presence of the parasite inside your red blood cells. This is the most definitive test, since you can actually see the live parasite in your blood cell.


This is complicated by individuals falling victim to other tropical diseases while being immune to malaria.In the United States, physicians are not trained in tropical medicine, which causes the diagnosis of malaria to be missed 60% of the time., Cerebral malaria is a late stage manifestation of malaria. Malaria parasites have the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is one of the worst problems associated with malaria. If you have cerebral malaria, you may experience coma, seizure, altered consciousness, abnormal behavior, and other changes in sensory perception. Go to the hospital immediately if you think you have cerebral malaria.

Search for government information. Government agencies responsible for keeping an eye on health trends are likely to be the most up-to-date and reliable sources of information, so they should be your first port of call. The sites likely to be most relevant in terms of government include health departments or agencies, health centers sponsored and validated by a government agency, and foreign affairs travel warning sites. In the United States, a good place to begin is with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP).
Ask your medical practitioner for more information to help determine if your destination is home to malaria.
If you know people who live in the area, send them an email or telephone them to ask them what they know about the current situation and particular requirements that they've been told.
Ask the travel agent and airline. These are not going to necessarily be helpful or reliable but they might be your final source for checking independently if needed.;
, The first line of defense will be the prescription of anti-malarial drugs (also known as malaria prophylaxis medicines).It is helpful to do some research of your own into these drugs so that you can have an informed discussion with your doctor about which drugs are best in your case. Some medication can have severe side-effects, such as violent mood swingsin those who suffer from pre-conditions such as depression in the case of mefloquine,so ask your doctor pertinent questions and ensure that there is plenty of time to notice any negative changes before you leave your own country so that changes to the drug prescribed can be made if needed (at least three weeks of weekly tablets of mefloquine at home before leaving is beneficial). In addition, resistance to some anti-malarial medication is becoming increasingly evident, as in the case of chloroquine, so you may have less choice in the type of medication you take in areas with high resistance levels.Talk to your health practitioner about the options and be sure to specify the exact destination, as even where you're going can impact the type of anti-malarial drugs you'll be given. You will usually have to commence medication for a week or more prior to departure, so be sure to see your doctor early on in your travel plans.


Follow the recommended dosage and schedule to ensure effectiveness of the drug. Typically, you may expect to take the proper dosage 1-2 weeks before departure, throughout the duration of the trip, and for 4 weeks after leaving the infected locale.
Children can take anti-mararial drugs but the dosages will be a lot less than those for the adult. Chloroquine and proguanil tend to be prescribed for children, while doxycycline is unsuitable for children under 12.Follow the doctor's advice and be sure to raise any concerns you have at the time of your visit.
Understand that anti-malarial drugs are not 100 percent effective, and travelers still run the risk of possible malaria transmission if additional preventive measures are not taken.

, There are some people who should really think twice about going into an area infested with malaria. These are pregnant women, infants, young children (ask your doctor about what age he or she considers ""safe""), and anyone who is immuno-compromised, including those who have had their spleen removed.For pregnant women, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (see below) can cause abortion, premature birth, still-birth, and maternal death,so pregnant women should not travel to areas where this genus of mosquito is prevalent. WHO advises against taking infants and young children into malarious areas, especially where there is P. falciparum.In some cases, it may be possible to travel to an urban part of a malarial country where the mosquito population is under control and to require vulnerable people to remain there while the rest of the party travels into malarious areas. This at least gives the option of traveling part of the way and seeing the sights of at least part of the country.

, Many malaria deaths are considered to have been preventable if only travelers were more aware.Be absolutely certain that taking anti-malarial medicine is not enough on its own to protect you. You also need to take the precautions suggested in the following steps for more thorough protection. Some helpful things to understand about mosquito behavior include:It is certain species of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles that bite. She usually does so between dusk and dawn.
The most common malarial parasites that infect humans are: Plasmodium falciparum (life-threatening); and three ""benign"" malaria strains: P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. P. falciparum kills an estimated 1 to 2 million people a year and those most vulnerable to it are those who have not grown up in a malarial environment.

, There are a number of sensible precautions that you can take to keep mosquitoes (and other unhelpful bugs) at bay when you're traveling.The following sections provide several methods aimed at reducing your risk provided you are consistent, assiduous, and careful at all times. Note that a number of these measures will also decrease the risks of being bitten, burrowed into, chewed on, etc. by other bugs but you should still take appropriate precautions targeted at any particular danger you're aware of. In a nutshell, specialist in travel medicine, Dr Charlie Easmon, recommends that a traveler use the A, B, C, and D prevention method:A – for awareness. As already stated, being aware of the risk is your first line of defense.
B – for bite avoidance. Not getting bitten should be your number one aim.
C – for chemoprophylaxis. This means taking preventive methods when traveling into a malarious region.
D – for diagnosis. If you are unfortunate enough to contract malaria, prompt attention and treatment of it is essential.
E – for remote travel. Dr Easmon adds this because if you're traveling somewhere remote, you'll need to know how to use emergency treatment with safe drugs. Talk to your doctor; at this level you should at least be proficient with first aid and have a basic understanding of responding to symptoms etc.

, There are different types of repellent available on the market and some ingredients are stronger than others and may not be available in all countries. Generally, products containing pyrethrum or synthetic pyrethroids are considered safe for personal use.Use of products containing DEET (chemical name, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a personal choice, but DEET is highly effective against mosquitoes and other insects and is considered to have an excellent safety profile for adults, pregnant women, and children.Products containing DEET currently are available to the public in a variety of liquids, lotions, sprays, and impregnated materials (for example, wrist bands).DEET products should not applied to babies under two months of age and for children the percentage of DEET should be within the range of 10 to 30 percent.When using DEET, follow the manufacturer's instructions accurately, do not apply to open wounds or cuts, do not apply under clothing, and wash the DEET off when you are back indoors.Apply insect repellent only to exposed skin, not under clothing which is already serving as a barrier. Confirm the effectiveness of your repellent by checking the CDCP web site and follow all label instructions for proper application.
Non-DEET alternatives for those who dislike DEET include: Jungle Formula, Bayrepel, Mosi-guard, etc.Watch for signs of an adverse reaction to any personal insect repellent that has not been used before. Symptoms can include rashes, swelling, redness, etc. Stop using it immediately, wash it off, and contact your local poison center for assistance., Bear in mind that mosquitoes aren't fussed about whether you're indoors or out, so you'll need to take precautions inside places that have not been protected adequately by screens and other barriers against entry. Sleeping measures include:Sleep indoors. Insect-proof all sleeping quarters or sleep under a mosquito net. Sleep off the ground. Sleeping outdoors in a malarious region is very dangerous as you are exposed to the mosquitoes. If you need to sleep outdoors, sleep under a properly installed, repellent-treated bed net.
Windows and any other entry points from outside should have gauze over them.The sleeping rooms should be sprayed with an insecticide in the evening to get rid of any mosquitoes that have dropped by during the day. Vaporizing synthetic pyrethroids (Bioallethrin 4.2% w/w) over an electrical heating device or over a spirit burner can help to clear the room of bugs, as can burning mosquito coils.
The sleeping net , screens, and curtains can be made more protective by soaking it in permethrin (0.2g per m2 of material every six months).These substances are harmless to humans.During the daytime, the sleeping net should be rolled up to prevent entry of mosquitoes or other insects., Both at day and during the night, wear clothing that makes it difficult for mosquitoes to penetrate your skin. The following methods can help:


Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and covered shoes.
Wear thick socks and tuck pants into them to prevent an entry point for mosquitoes.
Light colored clothing is less appealing to mosquitoes.Consider pre-treating clothing, socks, hats, bandannas, and shoes with pyrethrum or permethrin according the the instructions accompanying the product. Ask about other suitable products as well. Follow the label instructions when applying insecticide and allow adequate time for the items to dry before being used.
Also treat camping gear, bed nets, and blankets used for camping, expeditions, etc.

, Female mosquitoes are out and about between dusk and dawn, feeding at night. Reduce the chances of meeting them by remaining indoors during these peak biting hours.

, If you're planning on heading for a remote malarious area, an additional precaution is to include the use of quinine in case you get a fever.Some anti-malarial drugs can also be taken as stand-by treatments; talk to the expedition doctor for precise details.

, The dosage will have already been determined for you but if you experienced delays in your travel plans, etc., see your doctor as soon as you return for updated advice. Except for Malarone, all anti-malarial drugs need to be continued for four weeks after returning home.Failure of travelers to take anti-malarial drugs for the full prescribed cycle, including upon returning home, lessens their effectiveness.Be mindful that vomiting and diarrhea during the trip can also lessen the effectiveness of these drugs.

, Prompt treatment can save your life or reduce the severity of the disease. Symptoms include cycles of chills, fever and sweating every 1-3 days. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may also be present during feverish periods.


If a child contracts a fever after being in a malarious area, do not hesitate; go straight to the doctor as children succumb to malaria extremely quickly.
Malaria is a tricky disease. The P. vivax and P. ovale can become established in the liver in spite of taking anti-malarial precautions, causing relapse infections months or even years later. Talk to your doctor about taking additional precautions upon coming home from areas where these species are prevalent because you may need to take primaquine to eliminate the liver cycle."

Use extra precautions.,
Take preventative medication.,
Treat malaria.,
Seek immediate medical care.",How to Know if You Have Malaria2," There are some precautions you can take to prevent malaria, especially in countries where malaria is common. When spending time or sleeping outside, always use mosquito netting. This will prevent possibly infected mosquitoes from biting you. Also try to eliminate or avoid pools of standing water. These serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Make sure you also use plenty of insect repellent if you plan to be outside without netting.

, If you plan on traveling to areas where malaria is common, it is important you see your physician at least four to six weeks prior to your trip. At this time, they will likely prescribe medications for the prevention of malaria, which will help lessen the likelihood of you contracting malaria.


These should be taken before, during, and after your trip., The key point in the treatment of malaria is to catch it early. See a doctor for diagnosis within 24 to 72 hours of your possible infection or when your symptoms appear. There are many medications that you can take, which will be taken for a minimum of seven days. However, the length of time you need to take the medications will vary depending on the severity of your case and how much the rest of your body has been affected. All malaria medications are safe for children. Possible medications you may be prescribed include:


Mefloquine
Atovaquone-proquinal
Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
Quinine
Clindamycin
Doxycycline
Chloroquine
Primaquine
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, though its effectiveness has yet to be cleared, Since doctors in the US are not as aware of malaria issues, you have to be extra vigilant if you live there. If you arrive back in the US and have a fever for any reason, head directly to the emergency room or doctor’s office. Tell your doctor exactly where you have traveled and that you suspect malaria so they can treat you promptly.


A delay in diagnosis can result in death. 60% of diagnoses are delayed because of misdiagnosis of malaria as other diseases. To prevent this, always give an adequate history of where you have traveled in the last year or two.
If you contract malaria, you will hospitalized so the doctors can properly administer the antibiotics.

Get a diagnosis.,
Get treated for any underlying conditions.,
Ask your doctor about surgery to correct droopy eye.,
Seek emergency medical attention if necessary.",How to Treat Droopy Eyelids1," Before you can treat droopy eye, you need to get a diagnosis from a medical professional. Because droopy eyelids can be a sign of serious medical conditions, you should seek medical attention promptly. Your doctor should get a complete medical history and perform a physical exam to rule out serious neurological problems, infections, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases. Some other things that your doctor may do to find a diagnosis for your droopy eyelids include:


an eye exam to test visual acuity
a slit lamp test to check for corneal abrasions or scratches
a tension test to check for myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness;
, If your droopy eyelids have been caused by an underlying condition, then you will need to get treated for that condition before doing anything about your droopy eyelids. Treating an underlying condition may also help to improve your droopy eyelids.


For example, if you have been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, your doctor may prescribe various medications to treat the condition, including physostigmine, neostigmine, prednisone, and immunomodulators.Other conditions that may cause droopy eyelids include third nerve palsy and Horner's Syndrome. There are no treatments for these disorders, although surgery may help relieve symptoms of third nerve palsy., At present, there are no home remedies that are proven to treat droopy eye. Surgery is the only sure fix.The surgical procedure used to correct droopy eye is called a Blepharoplasty. During this procedure, the surgeon will remove any excess skin, remove excess fat pads, and tighten the skin on your eyelids.The procedure includes:


Before the surgery begins, your surgeon will administer a general anesthetic to numb the upper and lower eyelid area. Once the area is numb, your surgeon will make an incision in your eyelid crease. Next, your surgeon will use some gentle suction to remove any excess fat. The your surgeon will remove any excess skin and then reconnect your eyelid skin with dissolvable sutures.The whole surgery takes about 2 hours and patients may often go home the same day.
Following the surgery, your surgeon will bandage your eyelids to ensure proper healing and protection. You will need to follow your doctor’s instructions to clean and care for your wounds following the surgery. It will be about a week before you can remove the bandages.
Your doctor may also prescribe some eye drops and pain medication so that you are more comfortable as you recover., In some situations, eyelid drooping may indicate a much more serious problem that may require immediate treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the following symptoms:Eye Pain
Headache
Vision changes
Paralysis of face
Nausea or vomiting

Learn about eyelid function.,
Understand the anatomy of your eyelids.,
Recognize the symptoms of ptosis.,
Consider the potential causes of ptosis.",How to Treat Droopy Eyelids2," Eyelids provide external protection for your eyes, but they also serve other important purposes. When you suffer from ptosis, you may find that your eyelids do not perform these functions as well as they used to. The functions of your eyelids include:protecting your eyes from harmful elements, such as dust, debris, harsh light, and others
lubricating and hydrating your eyes by spreading tears over the surface of your eyes when you blink
eliminating irritants by producing excess tears as needed

, Your eyelids have muscles allow you to open and close your eyelids. You also have fat pads in your eyelids that get larger as you age. The aspects of your eyelid anatomy that are affected by ptosis include:Orbicularis oculi. This muscle surrounds your eyes and you use it to make facial expressions. It also connects to several other muscles.
Levator palpebrae superioris. This muscle allows you to lift your upper eyelids.
Fat pads. These pads are located in the crease of your upper eyelids.

, Ptosis is the medical name for a drooping eyelid or drooping eyelids. The severity of ptosis can vary from person to person, but sufferers may experience other symptoms in addition to excess skin around the eyelids. Symptoms may include:Visible eyelid drooping
Increased eye tearing
Visual disturbances

, Ptosis is due to the general loss of elasticity of the muscles of the eyes and can be due to a wide variety of factors and conditions. Knowing what has caused your eyelids to droop will help your doctor determine the right course of treatment, which is why it is so important to get a diagnosis from your doctor. Some possible causes of ptosis include:age
genetics or congenital malformationslazy eyedehydration caused by drug, alcohol, and/or tobacco use
an allergic reaction
Infections of the eyelid, such as a stye, or infections of the eye, such as bacterial conjunctivitis
Bell's palsy
a stroke

Understand what ""lazy eye"" is.,
See the doctor.,
Wear an eye patch.,
Use a prescribed eye medication.,
Treat the condition with corrective eyewear.",How to Treat a Lazy Eye1," Lazy eye is a term used to describe the medical condition called ""amblyopia."" Amblyopia is a condition that develops most often in children sometime before the age of seven. It starts with one eye being stronger than the other, and an automatic response in the child to use the stronger eye more than the weaker one (as the child gradually begins to favor the strong eye more and more). This leads to reduced vision in the weaker eye due to incomplete development of the visual pathway, which worsens over time (the longer the condition goes untreated).It is for this reason that diagnosing and treating amblyopia as soon as possible is key. The sooner it is recognized and dealt with, the better the outcome and the quicker the fix.There are usually no long-term consequences from amblyopia, especially when it is caught early and is a minor case (which the vast majority are).Note that, over time, as the ""good eye"" continues to get stronger in relationship to the ""bad eye,"" the ""bad eye"" will begin to be misaligned. What this means is that when you look at your child, or when the doctor examines her, one eye (the ""bad"" one) may appear to be wandering off to one side, not focused on the object at hand, or somehow ""not perfectly straight.""
This misalignment is quite common with amblyopia and usually resolves with prompt recognition and treatment.;
, Since amblyopia is a condition diagnosed most commonly in children, if you suspect your child may have the condition it is best to see a physician as soon as possible. For the best chance of catching a case of lazy eye early, ensure that your child receives regular eye exams while she is young — some doctors recommend exams at six months, three years, and then every two years after that.Although the prognosis is typically best for young lazy eye sufferers, recent experimental procedures have shown promise for adult sufferers.Talk to your doctor or ophthalmologist to learn the latest treatment options available to you.

, For certain cases of lazy eye involving impaired vision in one eye and normal vision in the other eye, patching or covering the ""good"" eye may be required. Forcing the lazy eye sufferer to use his ""bad"" eye to see gradually strengthens the vision in that eye. Patches are most effective in patients younger than the age of seven or eight.The patch is typically worn between three to six hours per day for a period of time ranging from a few weeks to as long as a year.


A doctor may recommend that, while wearing a patch, the lazy eye sufferer concentrate on performing activities like reading, schoolwork, and other activities that force her to focus on up-close objects.
Patches may be used in conjunction with corrective eyewear.

, Medication— usually in the form of atropine eye drops —may be used to blur the vision of the good eye in order to force the weaker one to work. This treatment works according to the same principle as a patch treatment works by — forcing the ""bad"" eye to see gradually strengthens its vision.


Eye medication can be a good choice for children who are reluctant to wear an eye patch (and vice versa). However, eye drops may not be effective when the ""good"" eye is nearsighted.Atropine eye drops are sometimes associated with minor side effects, including:Eye irritation
Reddening of surrounding skin
Headaches



, Special glasses are commonly prescribed to improve the focus of of the eyes and correct misalignment. For certain cases of lazy eye, especially when nearsightedness, farsightedness, and/or astigmatism contribute to the condition, glasses can fix the problem entirely.In other cases, glasses may be used in conjunction with other treatments to fix lazy eye. Talk to your doctor or optometrist if you are interested in obtaining glasses for your lazy eye.


In children of a sufficient age, contact lenses may sometimes be used instead of glasses.
Note that, initially, people with lazy eye may find it more difficult to see when wearing their glasses. This is because they have become accustomed to their impaired vision and need time to gradually adjust to ""normal"" vision.

"
"
Undergo a surgical procedure.,
Do eye exercises as recommended by your doctor.,
Follow-up with your doctor for regular eye exams.Even after amblyopia has been surgically corrected (or otherwise corrected), it is possible that it may return in the future.",How to Treat a Lazy Eye2," Surgery may be performed on the eye muscles to straighten the eyes if non-surgical means are unsuccessful. Surgery can also help in the treatment of amblyopia if the condition is caused by a cataract.Surgery may be accompanied with the use of an eye patch, eye medication, or glasses, or, if it produces good results, may be sufficient on its own.

, Eye exercises may be recommended either before or after surgery to correct faulty visual habits and to teach normal, comfortable use of the eyes.


Because amblyopia often comes hand-in-hand with weakened eye muscles on the ""bad side,"" it can take strengthening exercises to get your eye muscles even on both sides again.

, Ensuring that you follow-up with your doctor according to the schedule of eye exams that they recommend will help you to avoid this problem.

Determine if you have been bitten by a tick.,
Identify the symptoms.,
Go to the doctor.,
Have your blood and spinal fluid tested.,
Treat the virus with supportive care.",How to Diagnose Powassan Disease1," Powassan virus is transmitted via a bite from an infected tick. It may take one week to one month for the virus to fully incubate and become an illness. Figure out if you have had a tick bite within the last couple of months. This means you may be at risk.If you find a tick connected to you, you know you have been bitten. If you don't find a tick, you may determine you have a tick bite if you have been in a high risk area and find a red welt-like bite. The bite may be oval in shape with a scab. The bite may itch.;
, Some people who get the Powassan virus do not develop any symptoms. If you do develop symptoms, they generally are neurological since the Powassan virus affects the central nervous system. You may experience confusion, coordination problems, weakness, speech problems, loss of memory, or seizures. In some severe cases, people can develop inflammation in the brain.You may also develop a fever and headaches. Some people may vomit.
You may experience muscle or joint aches, including a stiff neck.

, If you believe you may be infected with Powassan virus, you should go to the doctor for evaluation and diagnosis. The doctor will perform an exam, during which they will look for symptoms consistent with Powassan virus. They will also ask you about your outdoor activities and whether you have been bitten by a tick.If you are from an area where Powassan virus is not a problem, you need to tell them you were in an area where you may have been exposed. You should also include the dates of travel.

, If the doctor believes you have Powassan virus, they will do a lab test to confirm. First, they will take a blood sample. Then, they will take a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid. Using both of these sample, they will look for specific antibodies that occur if Powassan virus is present.You may have to wait up to two weeks for your test results., There is no cure for Powassan virus. The treatment given is supportive care that aims to help with symptoms. Supportive care includes respiratory support, IV fluids, and medication to target brain swelling. If you have severe symptoms, you will be hospitalized.Around 10 to 15 percent of cases of Powassan virus with encephalitis are fatal. Around half of the survivors will suffer from neurological problems and complications."
"
Be alert if you spend time outdoors in northern areas of the US.,
Cover yourself when outside in brushy areas.,
Use insect repellent.,
Bathe after being outdoors.",How to Diagnose Powassan Disease2," You are at the greatest risk for Powassan virus if you are bitten by a tick while in the northeastern or Great Lakes areas of the United States. This is where most cases have occurred. You are at a higher risk if you spend time in wooded or brushy areas.Ticks are most active in these areas in spring, summer, and fall.

, Try to wear clothing that covers as much of your skin as possible when you are outside. You can wear long sleeves, long pants, socks, and boots.Some types of clothing may not be feasible depending on the climate or activity. Attempt to cover up as much of your skin as possible.

, Use a safe tick repellent when you know you are going to be outdoors in brushy or wooded areas. Tick repellents that contain 20 percent or more DEET are recommended. Put the repellent on your skin and your clothing., When you come in from being in areas that may contain ticks, take a bath or shower within two hours. This helps get rid of ticks crawling on you.Before you get in the shower, check your entire body for ticks. Use a hand mirror for hard to see places.

Consider surgery when cataracts begin to interfere with your everyday life.,
Learn about phacoemulsification.,
Learn about extracapsular cataract extraction.,
Discuss various lens implant options.",How to Treat Cataracts with Surgery1," Cataracts generally appear in individuals over the age of 55 and progress slowly. At first, cataracts may not interfere much with your vision. If your cataracts are mild, you can take some steps to ease the discomfort and/or inconvenience. When they begin to challenge you daily, it is time to consider having them removed.In the mean time, you deal with symptoms by:


Making sure glasses and contact lenses are the most accurate prescription.
Using a magnifying glass to read small text.
Improving the lighting in your home.
Wearing sunglasses when you go out during the day.
Limiting driving at night.;
, This surgical process to remove cataracts involves using an ultrasound probe to break up the lens for removal. This is the most common method for cataract removal. This is a simple outpatient procedure that take an hour or less to perform.Your surgeon makes a small incision in the front of your eye and inserts a tiny probe into the lens (where the cataract has formed).
Your surgeon then uses this probe to break up the cataract (using ultrasound waves) and draw out the fragments.
The back of your lens is left intact. This serves as a place for your lens implant to rest.
Stitches may or may not be needed.

, This is another method for removing cataracts. It involves making an incision in the eye and removing the lens in one piece. This procedure is less common and a bit more invasive. This method may be used if you have certain eye complications. Nonetheless, this is still an outpatient procedure that can be done in as little as one hour.Your surgeon will make a larger incision in your eye.
Through this incision, your surgeon will remove the front capsule of the lens.
The back of your lens is left intact. This serves as a place for your lens implant to rest.
This procedure will require some stiches.

, Almost everyone who has cataract surgery will be given an artificial lens (to replace the one that is removed). This is called an intraocular lens (IOL). Before your surgery, discuss the various types of IOLs with your doctor to determine which one is best for you and your lifestyle.IOLs can be made of plastic, silicone, or acrylic.
Some IOLs can block UV light.
Just like glasses or contact lenses, IOLs can be fixed-focus monofocal, multifocal, or toric (for astigmatism correction).
Think about your lifestyle. Are you often in bright sun or dimly lit spaces? Are you often outdoors? Do you play sports? Inform your doctor about these needs.
Both your eye care requirements (such as any corrective adjustments and/or the shape of your eye) and your lifestyle will help determine the IOL that is best for you.

"
"
Undergo tests.,
Use antibiotic eye drops.,
Stop taking certain medications.,
Consider local anesthetic.,
Fast prior to surgery.",How to Treat Cataracts with Surgery2," Approximately one week prior to your surgery, you doctor will need to perform a painless ultrasound test. This will measure the size and shape of your eye, helping to determine the best type of lens implant for you., Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops to be used for 1-2 days prior to the surgery. This is a preventative measure that lowers your risk of infection., Your doctor may recommend that you temporarily stop taking certain medications. Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor at least two weeks before your scheduled procedure, and follow your doctor’s instructions.This will apply to any medications that could increase your risk of bleeding.
Additionally, some of the drugs prescribed to treat prostate problems have been shown to interfere with cataract surgery.

, It can be scary to let a surgeon cut open your eye (even if it’s only a tiny incision). As such, some people opt to be “put to sleep” with a general anesthetic. However, you should consider “staying awake” with a local anesthetic. This offers far few risks of complication, and a quicker recovery.Local anesthetic is administered ""locally,"" to block any painful sensations where your surgeon will be working. You will be awake and aware, but you should not feel any pain. Local anesthetic is safe and carries very few risks.
General anesthetic affects your entire body and renders you temporarily unconscious. It must only be done under the supervision of a trained anesthesiologist. General anesthetic can lead to changes in blood pressure, which (although rare) can be dangerous. Furthermore, recovering from general anesthetic is more difficult and takes more time.

, As with most surgeries, you will likely be advised not to eat or drink anything for 12 hours prior to the procedure. Eat a nice meal and drink a big glass of water, then refrain from eating or drinking for 12 hours."
"
Complete the surgery in around one hour.,
Get a ride home.,
Return for the other eye.,
Follow recovery procedures.",How to Treat Cataracts with Surgery3," You will arrive at the hospital and check-in with a nurse. Soon (unless you have requested a general anesthetic), you will be given a local anesthetic and begin to go numb. Depending on the type of cataract surgery you are having, the surgeon will then work for up to one hour. You will be aware that something is happening, but you should not experience any pain. After the surgeon is finished, you will be given some time to rest, before being released., This procedure usually takes only about an hour, so you will be able to go home the same day. However, you will not be able to drive. Be sure to arrange a ride home from the hospital., If you have cataracts in both eyes, you will need to return at a later date (usually a few months later) to have the procedure done on the other eye. This is done so that you can maintain proper vision in one of your eyes as you recover.

, After your procedure, expect your vision to start improving after just a few days. You should plan to see your doctor a day or two after the surgery, then again the following week, and once again after a month or so. Most discomfort should be gone after a few days, but it will take around eight weeks for your eye to heal.Contact your doctor right away if you experience:


Vision loss
Persistent pain
Severe eye redness
Light flashes or new floaters in front of your eye

Eat nutrient-rich meals.",How to Treat Cataracts," Before you start any treatment plan for cataracts, consult with your doctor or ophthalmologist, which is an eye doctor. She can confirm that you have cataracts and help you figure out what the best types of treatment are for the current stage of the condition.


Your regular doctor may send you to see an ophthalmologist to get a specialist’s opinion on the best course of treatment for you.
Be aware that you may need surgery for cataracts at some point because they can significantly impair your vision.Some cataracts will develop to a certain stage and then stop progressing.In these cases, you may not need surgery.;
, Make sure to get regular eye checkups that measure your eyesight. Wearing the right prescription glasses or contacts can help counter the effects of cataracts in their early stages.You can get proper prescription glasses or contacts either from your ophthalmologist or an optometrist.Make sure to wear your prescription lenses according to your doctor’s instructions so that you can most effectively counter the cataracts.
iI is possible that as the cataract worsens, that your prescription may change rapidly. In fact, your unaided (no glasses) vision may initially improve as the cataract worsens, before it gets worse again. This is all due to the shifting refractive index/error of the lens as the cataract progresses.

, If you read a lot or are having a difficult time reading, use a magnifying glass to aid you. This can help relieve strain on your eyes and also neutralize the effects of your cataracts.There are many different types of magnifying glasses from which you can choose. Some models have lights to further assist your reading and others are specifically designed to the contour of your hand.
Ask your doctor which type of magnifying glass is best suited for your needs.
You can purchase magnifying glasses at many pharmacies and large retailers and some medical supply stores.

, In your home, replace current light bulbs for brighter options or add more lighting and lamps to your home. This can help you offset any difficulties in vision you may be experiencing from your cataracts.Purchase the strongest lighting available to you or the strongest wattage light bulbs your lamps will accommodate.Consider buying only clear light bulbs, which emit a stronger and brighter light than opalescent options.

, If you go outside during the day, decrease the amount of glare from the sun to which you’re exposed. Wearing a broad-brimmed hat or sunglasses are the best ways to do this.


You may want to inquire with your ophthalmologist or optometrist about prescription sunglasses to further boost the anti-glare and sight effects of sunglasses.
Any type of broad-brimmed hat can help reduce glare.
Wearing a hat and sunglasses has the added effect of UV-protection for your eyes. Ultraviolet light may contribute to the development of cataracts, so this can help minimize your risk of exacerbating current cataracts., People with capsular cataracts may benefit from drops that dilate their pupil(s). Speak with your doctor to see if this can help with your cataracts.Be aware that one side effect of these types of eye drops is that they can produce glare, which can make seeing with cataracts worse. Dilating drops can also affect your ability to read or focus up close.

, Glare from headlights can make seeing with cataracts difficult and cause double vision.Limit driving during the evening as much as you can to minimize your risk of getting into an accident.Ask friends or family members to drive you if you need or want to go out at night. You may also want to consider taking public transportation.
If you don’t have other options, make sure that your headlights are clean so that they can emit the most amount of light to help you see.Make sure that your windshield is clean both inside and outside so that your vision is optimal.You may also want to limit driving in the rain, which can increase glare., Your cataracts will likely get to a point where your vision is affected significantly enough to require surgery. Speak to your doctor and schedule an appointment to have your cataracts removed surgically.Consider surgery once cataracts begin to interfere with your everyday activities.Cataract surgery removes your clouded lens and replaces it with a new, clear lens.In some cases, your doctor cannot replace the lens because of other eye problems or medical issues. Your doctor can still remove the cataract and prescribe corrective lenses to help you see without a new lens implant.Cataract surgery is safe in most cases.It can cause infection or bleeding.Cataract surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis and won’t require a hospital stay.It is the most frequently performed surgery in the U.S. each year.
If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor will schedule two separate surgeries to help ensure that you have vision in at least one eye., Doctors have not been able to prove through studies how to prevent or slow the progression of cataracts. However, they think that several strategies can help reduce the likelihood of developing cataracts or even slow their progression., Make sure to schedule at least annual visits with your ophthalmologist. She can detect cataracts in the early stages and help formulate a treatment plan for them.You doctor can tell you how often you should schedule appointments to help treat cataracts., Recent studies have shown that smoking can increase your risk for cataracts.Either quitting or reducing how much you smoke may help you avoid cataracts or slow their progression.If you are not able to quit smoking and want to, speak with your doctor about different treatment options such as medication or counseling to help you stop., There is some evidence that alcohol consumption may increase your risk of developing cataracts.Limit the amount of alcohol you consume to help minimize your risk for getting cataracts or having them progress.The guidelines for sensible drinking recommend no more that two to three units of alcohol a day for women and three to four units per day for a man.Units are based on the total percentage of alcohol in a beverage and the amount of alcohol consumed.For example, a bottle of wine has nine to 10 units.If you are trying to limit your alcohol intake and having difficulty, either avoid situations in which alcohol is present or you may want to speak to your doctor.

, Ultraviolet light from the sun can promote the development and progression of cataracts.Wearing some form of protection from the sun can help to minimize your risk of getting cataracts.Wear sunglasses that specifically block out UVB rays.Consider getting a pair of prescription sunglasses to most effectively protect your eyes.
If you do not like wearing sunglasses, put on a hat with a large brim, which can help protect your eyes from UV rays.

, There are certain conditions such as diabetes that can increase your risk of developing cataracts.By maintaining your health and managing any health problems, you may be able to prevent cataracts.Eye conditions or trauma and past eye surgery may increase your risk of developing cataracts.Diabetes can make it more likely that you get cataracts.Long term use of steroids, antipsychotic medications, and statin drugs may increase your risk for cataracts., Scientists have shown some evidence that obesity is linked with a higher risk for cataracts.Keeping your weight at a healthy level can minimize your risk for cataracts.Staying active and keeping a healthy diet can help you maintain your weight.Stick to a diet of about 1,800-2,200 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are.Aim to get some form of exercise or activity most days of the week.You can go for a walk or try other activities such as swimming or running.

, Eating healthy meals can help you maintain your weight. However, making sure that you choose foods high in vitamins and nutrients can also protect the health of your eyes, including minimizing the risk of cataracts.You will get proper nutrition if you incorporate foods from the five food groups every day. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.Adding a wide variety of colorful fruits and vegetables can promote the health of your eyes.You need 1-1.5 cups of fruit per day. You can get this from eating whole fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries, or from drinking 100% fruit juice.Make sure to vary the fruits you choose so that you get a range of nutrients and don’t process them in any way. For example, eating a cup of pure berries is much cleaner than eating berries on top of a cake.
You need 2.5-3 cups of vegetables per day. You can get this from eating whole vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, or peppers, or from drinking 100% vegetable juice.Make sure to vary the vegetables you choose so that you get a range of nutrients.
Fruits and vegetables are an excellent source of fiber. Fiber will also help you to maintain your weight."

Notice squinting.,
Be aware of headaches.,
Pay attention to double vision.,
Look for light halos.,
Notice if you are experiencing a glare.,
Notice blurry vision.,
Pay attention to night blindness.",How to Tell if Your Eyes Are Going Bad1," This is the act of tightly squeezing the eyes together in an effort to see objects better. People with vision problems often have different shaped eyeballs, cornea, or lens. This physical malformation prevents light from entering into the eye correctly and causes blurry vision. Squinting narrows the curvature of the light and increases the clarity of vision. , Headaches can be caused by eye stains. Eye strains are caused by placing too much stress on the eye. Activities that cause eye strains include: driving, staring at computers/tv for long periods of time, reading etc. , Double vision is seeing two images of one object. It can occur in one eye or both. Double vision can be caused by having an irregular shaped cornea, cataracts, or astigmatism. , A halo is a bright circle surrounded by a source of light, usually headlights. Halos typically occur in dark environments, for example at night or in dark rooms. A halo can be caused by nearsightedness, farsightedness, cataracts, astigmatism, or presbyopia.

, A glare is a source of light that enters your eye that does not improve vision. A glare typically occurs in the daytime. A glare can be caused by nearsightedness, farsightedness, cataracts, astigmatism, or presbyopia. , Blurry vision is the loss of sharpness in the eye which affects the clarity of vision. Blurry vision can occur in one eye or both. It is a symptom of nearsightedness. , Night blindness is trouble seeing at night or in dark rooms.This condition is typically made worse when someone has just been in a bright environment. Night blindness can be caused by cataracts, nearsightedness, certain medication, vitamin A deficiency, retina issues and birth defects.

Identify nearsightedness.,
Identify farsightedness.,
Identify astigmatism.,
Identify presbyopia.",How to Tell if Your Eyes Are Going Bad2," Nearsightedness makes it difficult to see objects far away. This is caused by having an eyeball that is too long, or a cornea that is too curved. This affects the way light is reflected on the retina, which causes blurred vision. , Farsightedness makes it difficult to see objects that are up close. This is caused by having an eyeball that is too short, or a cornea that is not curved enough. , An Astigmatism is when the eye doesn’t focus light properly into the retina. Astigmatism causes objects to appear blurry and stretched out. It is caused by an irregular shaped cornea. , This condition typically comes with age (over 35). This condition makes it difficult for the eye to focus on objects clearly. Presbyopia is caused by a loss of flexibility and thickening of the lens inside the eye. "

Get tested.,
Test for glaucoma.,
Get your eyes dilated.,
Wait for the test.,
Determine your eyeglass prescription.",How to Tell if Your Eyes Are Going Bad3," Diagnosing vision loss is done by performing a series of tests called a comprehensive eye exam. There are several components to this test. A visual acuity test is a done to determine the sharpness of your vision. It is done by standing in front an eye chart with several lines of the alphabet. Each line has different sized letters. The largest letters on top and the smallest on the bottom. This examination will test your near vision by determining the smallest line you can read comfortably without strain.
Screening for hereditary color blindness is part of the exam as well.
Perform a cover test. This test will determine how well your eyes work together. The doctor will have you focus on a small object with one eye, and cover the other one. The purpose of doing this allows the doctor to determine if the uncovered eye has to re-focus to see the object. If the eye does have to re-focus to see the object, this could indicate extreme eye strain which would cause a “lazy eye”.
Examine the health of your eyes. To determine the health of your eye, your doctor will perform a slit light test. Your chin will be placed in a chin rest that is connected to a slit light. This test is used to examine the front part of the eye, (cornea, lids, and iris) as well as the inside of the eye (retina, optic nerves).

, Glaucoma is an increase in pressure in the eye that can lead to blindness. Testing for glaucoma is done by blowing a small burst of air into the eyes and measuring the pressure.

, It is very common to have your eyes dilated during an eye exam. Dilating the eyes involves placing medicated eye drops in the eye with the purpose of dilating (widening) the pupils. This is done to look for diabetes, high blood pressure, macular degeneration, and glaucoma.


Dilating the eyes usually last a few hours. Bring a pair of shades after the exam, as bright sunlight could be harmful to dilated pupils. The actual dilating of the eyes does not hurt, but it may be uncomfortable. , Comprehensive eye exams can take about 1-2 hours. Although the majority of the test results are immediate, the doctor may want to do further testing. If so consult your healthcare provider for a timetable.

, This is done by doing a refraction test. The doctor will show you a series of lens choices and ask which choice is clearer. This test determines the severity of nearsightedness, farsightedness, presbyopia and astigmatism.

Wear eyeglasses.,
Wear contacts.,
Correct vision with surgery.,
Determine if medication is an option.",How to Tell if Your Eyes Are Going Bad4," Vision problems are primarily caused by light not focusing properly in the eye. Eyeglasses help redirect the light to focus properly onto the retina. , Contacts are smaller lenses that are meant to wear directly on the eye. They float on the surface of the cornea.


There are many options you can choose from, for example some contacts are daily wear (one time use), others are designed to last longer.
Some contacts come in different colors and are designed for specific types of eyes. Consult your healthcare provider for the appropriate selection to meet your needs.

, While glasses and contacts are the more traditional method for correcting vision, the surgical method is gaining in popularity as well. There are SEVERAL different type of surgeries for the eye. However the two most common are Lasik and PRK.


In some cases surgery is suggested because contacts and eyeglasses are not effective enough to improve vision. In other cases corrective surgery is suggested as an option to wearing long term glasses or contacts.
Lasik is formally known as laser in-situ keratomileusis. This surgery is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. This surgery replaces the need to have contacts or eyeglasses. The FDA has approved Lasik eye surgery to be done on patients 18 years or older with an eye prescription of at least one year. Despite this, most physicians will recommend waiting until the mid-20’s because they eye are still changing.PRK is formally referred to as photorefractive keratectomy. It is similar to Lasik in that it also treats nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The age requirement for PRK is the same as Lasik. , For most common eye conditions, nearsightedness, farsightedness, presbyopia and astigmatism, medication is not used. For more serious problems your healthcare provider may prescribe a medication usually in the form of eye drops or pills. If you need further treatment seek your healthcare provider for more information.

Check for sore, tired, burning or itching eyes.,
Notice if your eyes are watery.,
Look out for blurred vision.,
Observe double vision.,
Notice frequent headaches.,
Notice increased sensitivity to light.,
Observe difficulty focusing.,
Take note of feeling you can't keep your eyes open.",How to Tell when You Are Straining Your Eyes1," If your eyes start to itch, burn or get tired, this might be a symptom of eye strain. Keeping your eyes focused for long periods of time at the same distance can sometimes cause eye fatigue. If this happens, take a break from what you're doing. A damp washcloth laid over the eyes may help relieve the discomfort.Extended use of computer devices is a major cause of eye strain.
Medical professionals suggest that anyone who uses a computer for more than 2 hours without a break is at greater risk for developing eye strain.
Incorporate short breaks when you can, to give your eyes a rest.;
, Watery eyes, or overproduction of tears from the eye's tear glands, is a common sign of eye strain. Tears, made of water, oil, and mucus, are the eyes natural lubrication. Eyes produce excess tears as a response to irritation or inflammation.Oddly enough, watery eyes are often the result of dryness in the eyes.
Prescription and over-the-counter eye drops may help with watery eyes.

, Blurred vision is when objects appear out of focus and hazy. It's a common symptom of nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism, which require corrective lenses. Blurred vision as a temporary condition is more likely to be the result of eye strain.Blurred vision is one of the more common signs of eye strain.
Blurred vision can also be the symptom of more serious health problems. If resting your eyes doesn't address your problem with blurred vision, see your medical provider.

, Double vision means that the eyes aren't properly processing information received in the brain. Typically, your eyes receive two different images which are combined by the brain into a single image. When the brain cannot combine the images into a single image, the person experiences double vision, seeing two different images of one object. Double vision can be a symptom of eye strain.Monocular double vision occurs when only one eye is affected, but processing in the brain results in seeing two images. It is less common than binocular diplopia, or double vision.
The most common cause of monocular double vision is uncorrected refractive error.
If you experience double vision, rest your eyes well. Make an appointment with your eye doctor if this symptom continues.

, Headaches associated with eyestrain start after using the eyes, especially for long periods of time. If you're noticing headaches associated with continuous use of your eyes to do detailed work, such as reading, sewing or any other task that requires you to maintain your visual attention for long periods of time, you may be experiencing eye strain.Take regular breaks in your visual attention to give your eyes a rest.
If your headaches don't improve, you may be experiencing visual focusing problems. Make an appointment with your eye care professional to get your vision checked.

, If you find yourself squinting painfully in ordinary light conditions, this may be a sign of eye strain. Light sensitivity, or photophobia, as a symptom of eye strain is caused by the pupil opening or closing too slowly, or not far enough, in response to changes in the quantity of light. It may also be caused by temporary inability of the cornea and the tears to work together. A smooth and lubricated eye surface is needed to begin the process of focusing light properly.Working your eyes hard to see in poorly-lit situations is a common cause of this symptom of eye strain.
If your computer screen is poorly lit, has a glare on it, or if there is poor contrast between the text and background of your screen, you may experience increased sensitivity to light and eye strain.
Lower the lights in your environment. Overhead light and other lights compete with the computer screen. If your computer screen reflects the window light, alter the angle or move it to lessen the glare.
Consider investing in sunglasses with polarized lenses and UV protection when you're outside. Certain tinted lenses with special lenses may be helpful when doing computer work. Talk to your eye doctor about options.

, When you turn your visual attention away from the computer, you may experience difficulty focusing on printed material. Or, you may notice afterimages from the computer screen even after you've turned your gaze away. These can be signs of eye strain.These symptoms of eye strain can be observed after sessions at the computer, driving a long distance without resting your eyes, or doing other activities that require prolonged visual attention.
Sometimes difficulty focusing can be caused by underlying eye conditions.

, Intense feelings of exhaustion in the eyes can be a symptom of eye strain rather than fatigue. Using digital screens is hard for your eyes because of the way the pixelated way in which images are produced. Your eyes must focus, and continually refocus, on tiny dots, rather than on the solid images found on a printed page. The stress results in eye strain.


In addition, you're likely to blink less often than you should when looking at a screen. The eye surface then dries out and becomes irritated.
Children may be more susceptible to symptoms of eye strain than adults, but less likely to report it.

Make a change in your environment.,
Adjust the lighting.,
Take breaks.,
Do relaxation exercises for the eyes.,
Adjust your screen.,
Limit screen time.,
Get an upgrade.,
Get an eye exam.",How to Tell when You Are Straining Your Eyes2," If your environment is dry, your eyes will have a harder time staying lubricated. Bring in a humidifier to maintain adequate moisture. If you sit in an area where you're blown by a fan, adjust your seating or adjust the fan to protect your eyes.If you must continually shift your visual focus between the printed page and the computer screen, use a paper stand to position the paper at the level of the screen.
Make sure your workstation and your chair are at the optimal height for you.

, If you work at a computer, the ambient lighting in your office should be about half as bright as a typical office environment. Close your blinds, shades or drapes to cut down on glare and ambient light. Using lower intensity light within your office or room can also help.Avoid using florescent lights, even full-spectrum lights.
Indirect incandescent or halogen lights are better choices if you're at risk of eye strain.
You can also adjust the lighting of your screen. Using a cool gray background rather than a bright white one may be more gentle on your eyes.

, When engaged in work that requires careful visual attention, make sure to schedule plenty of short breaks. Look away from your screen, and focus on an object across the room. If you're driving, stop every hour to take a short break.Looking down the hall or out the window even for 30 seconds allows your eyes to refocus, providing a break.
Avoid rubbing your eyes. Closing them will restore lubrication, while rubbing may irritate.

, With your elbows on your desk, place your palms in front of you. Allow your body to fall forward, and your head will rest in your hands. Close your eyes, and move your head so that your hands cover your eyes. Your fingers should gently reach toward your forehead. Take a deep breath through your nose, count to 4, and then exhale. Repeat 10 times.Perform this simple exercise several times a day.
Vary the count so that you're counting during the exhale, rather than the inhale. Repeat 10 times.
If you're unable to cover or close your eyes completely, allow your eyes to rest by positioning your lids almost all the way down. Allow your vision to become unfocused.

, Try to make sure your computer monitor is about 5 or 6 inches below your eye level, and 20 to 28 inches from the eyes. Your eyes should be gazing downward towards the screen.Having your gaze lowered prevents your eyes from drying out.
An adjustable chair will help you find your optimal position.
If you use a standing desk, make sure that your screen is still placed below your eye gaze, and that your posture is comfortable.

, Keeping screen time to a comfortable minimum is the most direct way to address eye strain, particularly in children. Children may not make the connection between computer use, eye strain and the need to rest their eyes.For every 2 hours of screen use, take a break for 15 minutes.
Follow the ""20/20"" rule: For every 20 minutes of screen time, look into the distance for 20 seconds.

, Older computer monitors (CRT, or cathode ray tubes) are more likely to cause eye strain than the newer, LCD (liquid crystal display) screens. Screens that have a noticeable ""flicker"" of the images should be avoided.Get the highest resolution screen possible.
Flicker isn't an issue with the LCD screen.

, If you've tried a number of treatments for eye strain and your symptoms haven't improved, schedule a visit with your eye care practitioner. The signs of eye strain are also found on other eye conditions, and may require additional treatment. During your eye exam, make sure to mention the number of hours you spend working at or looking at digital screens.Ask about eye wear or lenses specific for computer use.
Specially developed lens coatings and/or tints might also help with your eye strain.

Ask if your employer offers a flexible spending account (FSA).,
Calculate your costs carefully before starting an FSA account.",How to Save Money on Contact Lenses," You will need a prescription from within the last year in order to order contacts, so always ask your eye doctor for a copy after an exam.If you are considering trying to order contacts without an up-to-date prescription, know that online sellers are required to contact your doctor to verify your prescription.;
, If they will, this offers the best of both worlds. You can purchase your contacts from your doctor and often pick them up the same day, while saving the same amount of money you would shopping online., Your eye doctor will usually be able to give you at least a pair of free contacts. Be sure to look online before your appointment, as you can sometimes find coupons online that are redeemable at your eye doctor for an entire box of contacts.

, Comfort and quality of vision are of first concern when buying contacts, but it is worth asking your eye doctor if there is a comparable, less expensive brand that you can try.

, Stores like Costco, Walmart, and Sam’s Club have vision centers that can perform exams and sell contacts, often for less than your eye doctor. They also carry many contacts in stock, meaning you won’t have to wait on shipping, as you would for an online provider.

, Online coupon sites offer up to 70% off on certain brands, and big-box stores and national eye care chains also frequently accept coupons. Vision insurance companies like VSP also regularly offer discounts and rebates on top brands, so be sure to check with your insurance before purchasing contacts.And don’t forget to look for coupons for saline solution. Saving two or three dollars every time you buy a bottle can really add up by the end of the year.

, There are many websites that sell contacts for less than your doctor might, particularly if you buy in bulk.But you will want to make sure you are not only saving money, but also buying from a reputable company that can offer customer service or returns, if necessary.

, You want to be sure that the online seller you choose is capable of shipping your prescription quickly, and of handling returns if necessary. Before ordering, make sure:Customer service is available. This means you can get in contact with a live person if you need help or want to inquire about returns or shipping delays. Try their number before ordering. If you get an answering machine, you are likely dealing with a back-room operation.
You know how quickly your order will ship. Smaller companies may take longer to deliver because they only stock the most common prescriptions.
They offer returns. If you buy a year’s supply of contacts and your prescription changes or your eye doctor recommends a different brand, you’ll want to be able to return unopened boxes for credit.
The ordering process is secure. The URL at the top of your browser should begin with https:// rather than http:// on any page that you enter personal information.

, The bureau can inform you of any complaints against a company and how they were resolved., There are many online sites that will compare prices from multiple seller, including Google Shopping, BizRate, PriceGrabber, Shopping.com and Yahoo! Shopping. When considering the price, be sure to:Include shipping and handling fees.
Try entering large quantities in order to reduce shipping costs, but be sure to check the expiration date. Make sure you will be able to use all of your contacts before they expire.

, They may cost more than you think, due to exchange rates and possible import duties. Also, you will have fewer consumer rights if something goes wrong., The major factors of cost are initial price and how long you use each contact. Taking proper care of your contacts can help you save money.

, Doing so will ensure that you get maximum life out of weekly, monthly, or long term contacts. Make sure you employ proper cleaning to prevent the buildup of bacteria and protein deposits, thereby reducing the risk of eye infection and keeping your contacts comfortable for a longer period of time.


Wash your hands before handling your contacts.Though most cleaning solutions are now advertised as no-rub, rubbing your contacts while cleaning them is much more effective at removing deposits.Be sure to rinse your lens storage case and let it air dry between uses.Use fresh solution each time you store your lenses to maximize its effectiveness.Know that wearing your contacts overnight increases your risk of an eye infection eightfold and can cause them to wear out faster., While you may be tempted to wear your disposable contacts longer than recommended, doing so can increase your risk of eye infection. Even a single misuse might be enough to cause a serious, sight-threatening infection., Adding vision insurance to health insurance offered by your employer is usually inexpensive — often only and additional $3 to $7 a month. Purchasing your own is more expensive, but may still be worth it.Be sure to consider:


The total cost of the premium and copays, minus the amount your insurance will pay towards new glasses and contacts equals the cost of the insurance.
Compare the cost of insurance to the cost of an exam and contacts without the insurance.

, You can check with the insurer before purchasing insurance to be certain that the doctor you prefer accepts their insurance.

, An FSA lets your employer deposit up to $2,550 of pretax money into an account that you can use to pay for eye exams, glasses, contacts, and contact lens solution. The income used for these purchases is tax-free.Be sure to save your receipts if using an FSA. They may be necessary to claim the money from your account.

, Look at past expenditures to estimate how much money you will be spending. It is better to underestimate your expenses than to overestimate them, because any money in your FSA account that you do not use in a calendar year will be lost, with two exceptions:Your employer can provide a grace period of up to 2.5 months to use the money.
Or, your employer can allow you to carry over up to $500 per year to use in the next year.

Place the contact lens on your finger.,
Hold the lens at eye level.,
Look for the “U”.",How to Tell If a Soft Contact Lens Is Inside Out1," The rounded side should be downward, touching your finger. If it looks kind of like a bowl or a cup on your finger, you have it in the right orientation. If it looks like a dome, with the rounded side up, you have the contact lens flipped the wrong way. If you try looking into the bowl of the lens, they will look backward.If you can’t keep the lens even, try placing it on your palm instead.;
, Seeing the lens at the correct angle is paramount. Viewing from different angles can play tricks on your eyes, especially because you need the contact lens to see correctly. Look at it directly from the side. , When the contact lens is correctly oriented, it should have a fairly rounded appearance. It should resemble a wide letter “U”. When it’s inside out, however, it will resemble a “V” more than a “U”. Look for flaring at the edges. The lower part of the lens may be deceiving, but the edges themselves will look stretched towards the sides if the lens is inside out.
If the lens seems wider at the top, and the lines aren’t straight, it’s likely inside out.

"
"
Place the lens between your forefinger and thumb.,
Gently squeeze the lens.,
Study the lens.",How to Tell If a Soft Contact Lens Is Inside Out2," Adjust your fingers so they are towards the inside portion of the contact lens, and are not covering or touching the edges. There needs to be enough room for the contact lens edges to move., Be sure not to smash the lens. The point is not to test the integrity of the lens, or the limits to which it will bend. You just want to see what shape it makes when you bend it.

, If the edges point straight upward, like the eponymous taco, it is correctly aligned. If they squeeze or round outward, like the head of a vase, then the lens is inside out and should be reversed .


If you squeeze very tightly, a correctly oriented contact lens will bow enough the edges will curve towards one another.

Look for laser etching.,
Check for edge coloring.,
Put the lens in.",How to Tell If a Soft Contact Lens Is Inside Out3," Some lens manufacturers laser etch small numbers into their lenses that make this process even easier. Set the lens on your forefinger, rounded side down. Simply look for the numbers when viewing the lens from the side. If they are right-side up, the lens is oriented correctly., If you have a tinted lens, there will be a specific look to it if it’s inverted. Hold the lens on your fingertip and lower your hand. From there, look downward. If the edge is tinted in a blue or green color, which is dependent on the type of tint in the lens, then it’s in the right position. If the edges look like another color, they are inverted., If none of the other tests make it clear, you might have to insert the contact lens as it is. Unless you’re brand new to contact lenses, there will be a definite change in feel when a contact lens is inserted inside out. It will feel irritable, itchy, and uncomfortable.There may be a bit of confusion, however, because similar irritability can occur with a dirty lens that is inserted properly.

Find out if you have blurred close-up vision.,
Determine if you have difficulty with reading.,
Consider whether distant objects appear blurred.,
Ask yourself if you have difficulty seeing objects both close-up and far-away.",How to Tell if You Need Glasses1," Blurred close-up vision is an indicator of farsightedness (also known as hyperopia).If you find it hard to focus on something that is close to your eyes you may have hyperopia. There is no single distance at which an object becomes blurry that equates to hyperopia.


The extent of your hyperopia influences your ability to focus on close-up objects, so the further away you have be to focus on something, to more pronounced you far-sightedness.Having to sit further away from your computer or holding a book at arm's length are common indicators.;
, If you are used to doing a lot of up-close work, such as drawing, sewing, writing, or working on a computer, and are finding it harder to focus on the task, this can also be a symptom of presbyopia, which is a type of farsightedness caused by loss of elasticity in the eye muscles.It is common to develop presbyopia as we get older.


You can check this simply by holding a book in front of you and reading it normally. If you are holding it more than ten or twelve inches away you may have presbyopia.If you find yourself moving the book further and further away from your eyes to focus on the words, this could be presbyopia.
Often reading glasses will help with this.
Presbyopia typically develops during the ages of 40 and 65.

, If you find increasingly that distant object appear to you as blurred, but nearby objects are clear, you may have nearsightedness (myopia). Myopia typically starts to develop around puberty, but can occur at any time in life.Like hyperopia, myopia is a question of degrees. But if you can read a newspaper fine, but struggle to read the board from the back of class, or find yourself sitting closer and closer to the TV, this could be it.There is evidence that children who spent more time doing close tasks, such as reading, are more likely to develop myopia.
Environmental factors are less significant than genetics, however., Instead of having difficulty seeing close-up or far-away objects, you might have a tough time focussing on either of them. If this is the case, there is a good chance that you have an astigmatism."

You don't want the residue on your contacts. It is best to wash your hands with antibacterial soap and warm water. Then dry your hands thoroughly with a clean, lint-free towel.


Keeping good hand hygiene protects your contacts and eyes from harmful pathogens. Harmful pathogens can enter the eye via the lenses and cause eye infection or conjunctivitis.;
, Before you take out your contacts, you need a storage container, such as a contact case or other sterile storage containers. Also buy sterile saline or contact solution.


Make sure you are using sterile solution and not saline solution. While saline will keep lenses hydrated, sterile solution will disinfect them. Ask your eye doctor to be sure your solution is suitable for use with your contact type. by.Replace the container about every three months.

, Once you have the right container and solution, fill your case about halfway with solution. New and clean lens solution in cases will help keep them clean, allow for protein removal, and eliminate bacterial contamination. Have the caps off for easy deposit of the lenses., Before you remove your lens, add a few drops of sterile saline or artificial tears to each eye. This will hydrate and lubricate your eyes as well as the lenses, which will allow for easier removal. Position yourself low over a flat surface, such as over the top of your dresser or bathroom counter. This will ensure your contacts don't end up on the floor. Next, look straight ahead into a mirror so you can see your eyes., Press one index finger in between the top and bottom eyelash line. The should be the center of your contact lens, which will trap it under finger. Use the index finger of your opposite hand to pull up your upper eyelid. Move your top index finger holding the eyelid down toward your bottom lid. The result should be that the contact pops away from your eye.

, Use the middle finger on the hand with the contact to pull your lower eyelid down. Look up and carefully slide the contact down your eye, then pluck it out. Gently rub the contact with solution — use two to three drops and rub for about 10 seconds on each side. This will loosen proteins and debris that are stuck to the lens, improving comfort and longevity of the lens. Then drop the contact in the waiting solution container.


Even if the solution you use says it is ""no rub,"" you should not skip this step.
Repeat the same method on your other eye.

, If that method didn't work for you, you can try the catching method. Lower yourself over a surface to ensure that the contact won't fall to the floor. Look down and place one hand under your eye to catch the contact. With the other hand, take your index and middle finger and pull at the side of your eye away from your nose. Then blink. Once you blink, the contact should fall out into your hand.


You may find it easiest to pull outward on just the upper lid instead of both.
Repeat on the other side.

, If your hard contacts are unable to be removed through other methods, a tool called a suction cup (known as a DMV) can be used to help with removal. The tool adheres to the contact and uses suction to pull it out of the eye. Only use a suction cup if you can visibly see the contact in your eye.


To use, moisten the center of suction cup with sterile saline solution. Looking straight ahead, apply the suction cup to the center of your contact. Gently move the suction from side to side until it adheres to the contact and it is removed. Place the contact in the solution and repeat on the other eye., Issues with your eye can cause serious, long time effects. Seek medical attention right away if you spot warning signs such as:


The inability to remove the contact from your eye
An embedded contact inside your eye
Abnormal vision
Pain, redness, or discomfort after the contact has been removed"

This will prevent bacteria from entering your eyes which can lead to infection (like acanthamoeba keratitis).Dry your hands on a clean towel. Avoid toweling the fingertips that will touch your eyes, so you don't get towel fibers on your fingers.


Keep your nails trimmed and cleaned. Removing contacts with long nails can tear or split the contacts.;
, Your vision is blurry when eyes are dry so it can be difficult to tell if the contact is in place or not. Pull your lower eyelid down and apply a few drops of saline or artificial tears to hydrate the lens a little. This should make it easier to remove.Be careful when applying saline drops. The tip of the bottle shouldn't touch your eye. Doing so can introduce bacteria into your eye.

, This is a first indication of whether or not the contact is still in your eye. If your contact is truly stuck in your eye, your eye will probably feel very uncomfortable or it may hurt to open it.


Your eye may water and hurt if the contact is stuck under the lid or in the corner of your eye.

, You can try simply looking in the mirror. The contact might have shifted slightly off the cornea, but may still visible on the center of your eye. If you still can't find the contact, consider whether or not it could have fallen out while you slept. Or, it may just be stuck in a hard to see spot, like underneath your upper eyelid.


If you've truly lost the contact, it may have fallen out. In this case, you won't find the contact by looking throughout your eye.

, If you don't see the eyelid on your cornea (in the center of your eye), lift your upper eyelid while you look downward. Shine a flashlight underneath the eyelid to help find the contact. If your contact is ""lost"" in your eye, you'll probably feel a strange sensation, like something is stuck in your eye.The contact may have folded and is hiding under the eyelid. Shining a flashlight can make this easier to see.

, If both of your contacts are out of place, you won’t be able to see clearly. Ask a parent, roommate or friend to help you find your contacts. The helper can shine a flashlight in your eyes to locate the lenses. If you're comfortable with it, the helper could even assist you by removing the contacts from your eyes for you.


Your helper can also look around your bedroom to see if the contacts fell out while you slept.

, Blink and use your fingertips to rub on the closed eyelid to get the contact to move. You may need to add more saline to hydrate it so it moves easily.


Avoid rubbing your eyelids against the contact unless you've added moistening drops. Rubbing dry contacts could scratch the surface of your eye.

, If your contacts feel very dry, it may take several applications of saline drops and time before they start to feel moist again. Wait 15 minutes to give them a chance to become fully hydrated.Don't try to remove the lens until it slides around your eye like normal. Attempting to rip it off may cause an injury. Also, don't try to unfold the lens before removing it from you eye since you're more likely to tear it.

, If your lens is stuck on the side of your cornea, try looking in the opposite direction. This can help the lens slide closer to the center of your cornea.


Before you can remove the contact, make sure it slides easily across your eye, and gently slide it back into place.

, If your lens is stuck underneath an eyelid, take your eyelid by your index finger and thumb. Gently twist your wrist so that the fingers flip your upper eyelid inside out. This will expose the contact, making it easier to remove.Some eye doctors recommend inserting a new contact lens if you're having trouble getting a contact out from under your eyelid. Putting in a new contact and blinking may bring the old contact down from underneath the lid., Use your middle finger to hold your lower eyelid open. Take your index finger and slide the lens down to the white part of your eye. If the contact is fully hydrated, it won't stick to your eye.


Add saline or rewetting drops if your eye or contact starts feeling dry again.

, Carefully, squeeze the lens slightly between your index finger and thumb so that it starts to fold outward. Gently remove it from your eye. Immediately place the contact into a clean case with fresh solution.


Repeat this with the contact in your other eye.

, If you're having trouble removing the contacts with your fingers, you can purchase a small tool that safely grips the contact so you can easily remove it.Carefully follow the instructions or ask your eye doctor for a demonstration.

Using a tool is especially helpful if you can see where the contact is stuck, but you just can't remove it using just your fingers.

, Once you've gotten the contacts out of your eyes, don't rush to put in a new pair. Your eyes need a break. Don't put in new contacts unless your eyes are no longer red and irritated.You might want to wear glasses for the day to rest your eyes.

, If you still can't remove the contact, you should immediately call your eye doctor and schedule an appointment. Your eye doctor may recommend switching contact lens brands if your contacts often get stuck.You should also consider getting medical attention if:You've tried multiple times to get your stuck contacts out
Your eyes are irritated
Your eyes are red
You feel pain

Avoid touching the lenses.,
Rest your glasses with the frames up.,
Take off your glasses during certain activities.",How to Take Care of Your Glasses2," When you take off your glasses, use both hands to remove each temple (or arm) of the glasses from behind your ears. This prevents your glasses from becoming misaligned.


Do not push your glasses on top of your head when you are not wearing them. This could also cause them to become misaligned., Touching the lenses can leave fingerprints and smudges behind. When you handle your glasses, touch only the temples of the frames, not the bridge. This will prevent any accidental contact.

, Even clean surfaces can leave scratches on lenses. When you set your glasses down, make sure that they are resting on the temples, not on the frames. The frames should be facing up.Do not leave your glasses on a cluttered, wet, or dirty surface such as a bathroom counter.Soft cases are often made of a microfiber cloth that can be used to clean off occasional smudges.

If the lenses break while you wear them, it may cause injury to your eye.You may want to consider investing in sports glasses. Look for Trivex or polycarbonate lenses and padded frames that stay firmly on your face while you swim, run, or play sports.Some designs look more like sunglasses. These would be suitable for sports like baseball, basketball, or soccer. Other types function as prescription goggles. These are good for swimming and skiing.
Let your optician know what activities you participate in. They may be able to recommend a certain design of sports goggles for your particular hobbies.

, If you only use glasses for reading or certain tasks, you may not wear them constantly. Instead of accidentally misplacing the glasses, you can attach a special strap to them that will keep them around your neck. Straps can also help keep your glasses on your head."

, This will hydrate and lubricate eyes as well as your contacts, making them easier to remove.Ensure that you use a sterile saline solution.

, Plenty of good lighting and a mirror will help initially until you get used to the process of removing your contact lenses.

, Your contacts are not the same or interchangeable, so you don’t want to mix up the two lenses. By starting with the same eye each time, you’ll have less opportunity to mix them up by accident., Look up, and with your non-dominant hand, use your index finger to lift your top eyelid and eyelashes up and away from your eye. Then with your dominant hand, use your middle finger to pull your lower eyelid down and away from your eye.Make sure you keep your eyelashes out of your eyes.

, Without letting go of your eyelids, use the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand to grip the lens. Use the pads of your fingers to squeeze the lens gently (without folding or creasing the lens)., The gentle squeeze should remove the lens from the surface of your eye. From there, pull the lens down and away to remove it completely from your eye.Be careful with the pressure, so you don’t accidentally fold or tear the lens.

, Rather than trying to flip the lens over, you’ll have an easier time simply placing it on the palm of your opposite hand.This will also make it easier to clean the lens since you’ll want to use your dominant hand to do so.

, You should clean your storage case for your contact lenses each day before placing them back in the case. Use a sterile solution or hot water to clean the case and allow it to air dry before replacing your contacts.Let the case air dry upside down with the lids off.You may find it easier to clean the case when after you put your contact lenses in your eyes since this will provide plenty of time for it to dry.
Replace your case for your contact lenses every three months., Before you even remove your contact lenses, you may find it helpful to fill the case halfway with new, clean solution. This will make it easier to transfer the lenses directly into the solution rather than trying to fill the case with a lens still in the palm of your hand.


Never reuse old solution.Make sure you use sterile solution and not saline solution. While saline will keep lenses hydrated, you can’t properly disinfect them without the right solution. Always use your eye-care professional’s suggested solution for your type of contact lenses., With the lens in the palm of your clean hand, wet the lens using the correct solution for your type of contact lenses (as suggested by your eye-care professional). Then softly use the pad of your finger to rub the solution thoroughly along the lens. This helps remove any buildup or microbes on the lens more than simply soaking it in the solution alone.To avoid damaging or scratching the lens with your fingernail, start at the middle and rub to the outer edge, using gentle pressure.Remember to get both sides.
You should thoroughly clean your contact lenses daily to reduce the risk of eye infections or other contact-related complications., Rubbing the lens can help breakdown any buildup, but you should use a little more disinfecting solution afterward to help wash it away. Then you can gently place the clean lens into the fresh, clean solution that you already have waiting in the case. Make sure you place it on the side for the corresponding eye.


You may need to place more solution in the case after you place the contact lens inside. Make sure the case has enough solution to completely cover the lens.

, To avoid potentially mixing up your contact lenses, you may find it easier to do the process from beginning to end with one eye at a time. In this case, repeat the process for the opposite eye.

, To ensure that your contact lenses are completely disinfected, they must sit in the solution for the amount of time indicated on the product.

Go to sleep.",How to Put in Ortho K Lens1," Since you will be touching your eye directly when inserting the contact lenses, you’ll want to avoid getting any dirt or germs into your eyes. Wash your hands with soap for at least 30 seconds, and dry them on a clean towel.


If you have long hair, tie it up while you’re putting in the contact lenses. Hair can distract you by getting in your eyes, and could also transmit dirt and germs onto the lenses.;
, Place your left index finger gently against your right eyelid, and gently pull the eyelid up so your eye is as far open as possible. At the same time, place your left thumb under your lower lid and gently pull it down.It’s important that you keep your hands steady during this procedure. Keep your eye from blinking as you insert the contact lens.

, Set one of your contact lenses onto the tip of your index finger of your right hand. With your index finger, carefully lift it to your eye right. If the lens is damp, it should adhere to your finger and not slip around. Move the lens forward until it gently cups your cornea and is firmly in the center of your eye.Your iris is the colored section in the center of your eye, which surrounds the pupil. The iris dilates (opens and closes) the pupil to adjust the amount of light that enters your eye.Your cornea is clear, dome-shaped tissue that covers the front of your eye. The cornea allows light to enter your pupil, and helps focus light rays to assist the eye’s focus.Never force the lens into your eye.
It’s okay to repeat the procedure multiple times if you don’t successfully apply the lens the first time.

, Pull your finger back, as the lens should have adhered to the wet surface of your eye at this point. Blink several times, and the contact lens should center itself naturally by settling over the curved shape of your eye.If the lens does not center itself when you blink a few times, or if it feels uncomfortable or isn’t centered over your cornea, you’ll need to pull the lens out and try again. To remove the lens, grip it lightly by the sides and pull it lightly away from your cornea.

, You’ll need to use your thumb and index finger to hold your left eye open, then gently insert the lens over your iris. If your lenses are marked “R” and “L,” put the correct lens in the corresponding eye.


If you are left handed, you may find it easier to spread your eyelids apart with your right hand, leaving your left index finger free to insert the lenses.

Do not clean your Ortho-k lenses in water.,
Clean your Ortho-k lenses after each use.,
Rub the provided cleansing solution on each contact lens.,
Soak the lenses when they are not in use.",How to Put in Ortho K Lens2," Although tap, bottled, and distilled water are safe for consumption and often used to clean glasses and standard contact lenses, Ortho-k lenses should be kept away from all types of water.If the lenses come in contact with water, and rest in your eyes for 8 or more hours, it will put you at risk for a serious infection called Acanthamoeba keratoconjunctivitis.Instead, your lenses should be stored and cleaned in a sterile saline solution.Such a solution should have been provided to you when you first bought your Ortho-k lenses, and replacement saline solution can be purchased at your eye doctor’s office or at any pharmacy.

, Your optometrist should have given you a cleaning set to use with your Ortho-k lenses when you first purchased them. This kit will contain a cleaning solution, a saline solution (for rinsing and storage), a lens-storage case, and possibly Ortho-k-lens-specific lubricating eye drops., For best effect, drip 2–3 drops of cleaning solution onto each lens, and then rub the solution on both sides with your fingers.Rub the solution around for at least 1 minute. The solution should start to foam as you rub the lenses.


Cleaning your lenses will remove any dirt or oils that are on the Ortho-k lenses, and also remove any oil, hair, or skin that may have stuck to the lenses while in your eyes.
Rinse the cleaning solution off using the provided saline solution. It’s important to thoroughly remove the cleaning solution, as the abrasive cleaning chemicals will be harmful to your eyes., When you are not asleep, the Ortho-k lenses should be safely stored in the storage case that you have been provided.Fill each side of the storage case with saline solution (or another storage solution that has been provided), and, after you’ve cleansed the lenses, gently set them in the solution and screw the top on.


This will keep the lenses from being damaged, and allow the lenses to remain sterile.

Ask your optometrist if your eyes are myopic.,
Pursue orthokeratology before laser refractive surgery.,
Consider Ortho-k lenses if your child has progressive myopia.",How to Put in Ortho K Lens3," Orthokeratology is most often used to correct myopia (nearsightedness) in adults, so if you suffer from myopia, Ortho-k lenses may be the best solution.Ortho-k lenses are also effective at treating astigmatism and hyperopia.


Astigmatism occurs when your eyes fail to properly focus refracted light on the retina.Hyperopia is the medical term for farsightedness., Although Ortho-k lenses only provide a temporary solution to myopia or astigmatism and need to be worn nightly (or every other night), they are much less expensive than laser refractive surgery (such as LASIK), and may have comparable results.Unlike eye surgery, the results of orthokeratology are temporary and reversible.
Ortho-k treatment is painless and does not have any recovery period.
Children can use Ortho-k lenses, while surgery is only available to individuals over 18.
If you’d like to try Ortho-k lenses, your optometrist may ask you to complete a trial period with the Ortho-k lenses before giving you a full prescription. This will generally comprise a 1–2 week trial., Ortho-k lenses can be very effective. for children in the age range from 8–12 who suffer from progressive myopia (worsening nearsightedness). For children, not only can Ortho-k lenses improve daytime vision (as for adults), but the lenses can also prevent or slow the development of adulthood myopia.If you suspect your child is myopic, have them examined by an optometrist.

",How to Put in Soft Contacts," For many, this will mean a bathroom. It is possible to insert a contact lens without all of three of these aspects, but it is best not to try until you are more experienced.;
, Review the materials you need—contacts, contacts solution, mirror, soap, towel—and make sure they are all within reach. If something goes wrong or you need an item, you will not want to search around your bathroom with only one contact lens in.

, Having sterile, clean surfaces is key to avoiding pain and ensuring good eye health.In addition, having dry hands will make your contact lens move more easily from your finger into your eye., Do not rush this step. Be careful opening any new packaging so that the contact lens does not accidentally fly out.

, You should be able to see the contact lens in the pool of liquid. You may want to consider an extra clean or rinse at this stage., You can use your thumb to help guide the lens onto your index finger if needed. The round part of the contact lens should be touching on the pad of your finger. It should look like a small bowl sitting on your finger.It is good to have your index finger fairly dry when putting your contact on it. Contacts like to stick to wet things, so a dry finger will make it easier for the lens to stick to your eye.

, This is the best way to check for problems with your contact lens before you put it in, as you can see better with lighting from behind. It's easy to realize something is wrong once it's inserted—it will hurt!

, If the contact is inside out, the edges will flare out. If it is not, the it will resemble a bowl.Some contacts lenses have small laser-printed characters to help you figure out if it is inside out. If you look for the laser printed characters, they will be backwards if you're looking through the bowl of the contact but should look readable from the outer surface. The more you use these lenses, the easier it will become to recognize whether or not the lens is inside out.

, It will not be difficult to find debris on a lens. It could be a speck of debris, a fiber from a piece of clothing or towel, or a small bit of hair. If you find debris or fiber, put the contact lens back in your hand and rinse it with contact solution. Once you have rinsed it, bring the contact lens up to the light again to make sure it is clean.

, It should be apparent if a soft contact lens is torn—it will have a chunk missing from it or be folded into itself. You should not wear a torn contact lens—if your contact lens is torn, throw it away and open a new contact package., You should be only a few inches away from the mirror, maybe closer. It is probably most comfortable to use a mirror at eye level so you don't have to bend over in an uncomfortable position.

, Place your middle finger just below your bottom eyelid and gently pull down. Your finger can be as far up as your lower lid or just above your cheek., It doesn’t matter which finger you use. You can place it on your actual eyelid or right below your eyebrow. Gently pull up., If you are new to inserting contact lenses, your eye's first instinct is to close when a foreign object approaches. Holding your eye open will prevent your eye from doing so. You can also rolling your eye up or to the side to help with this or blur your vision.


The white part of the eye is less sensitive, so you are less likely to flinch if you look off to the side and put the lens on the conjunctiva (white part).

, Come in at an angle, with the bottom of the lens making contact first, then easing the rest on your eyeball.It should stick. If it does not stick, try again by moving your eye once the contact lens makes contact. Your finger should never directly touch your eyeball.

, Occasionally a newly placed contact my pop out when you blink. This step will ensure that it stays put., Does it feel uncomfortable? Can you see clearly out of that eye?

Remove larger pieces.,
Move your eye around to locate smaller pieces.,
Flush your eye to get rid of any remaining pieces.,
Visit your eye doctor if you have difficulty.",How to Remove a Broken Contact Lens1," Before attempting to remove a broken lens, make sure to wash your hands well. Wash them for thirty seconds, and make sure to remove any dirt or oils under your fingernails. Dry them with a lint-free towel.Use a soap that is free from perfumes to reduce the risk of irritation.;
, Get close to a mirror and use your thumb to hold your lower eyelid open and your index finger to hold your upper eyelid open. Try to locate the bits of contact lens in your eye with your other seeing eye. You might need a helper to direct you, especially if your eyesight prevents you from clearly seeing the lens fragments.Your helper should stick to giving direction and should not put their fingers in your eye or attempt to remove it themselves.

, Remove any large or easy to find pieces first as you would an intact lens. Move these pieces to the white of your eye. Carefully pinch them with the tips of your thumb and index finger (don't use your nails).Don’t throw any pieces away. Keep them in your contact lens case so they can help you determine if you’ve located and removed all fragments from your eye.

, Carefully move your eye up and down and side to side in order to locate smaller pieces. Try to hold your eyelids open as widely as possible in order to avoid scratching the surface of your eye. Small, jagged fragments might cause damage if they rub in between your eyelid or fingers and eye surface, so be very gentle in removing them., Check the label of your contact lens disinfectant to ensure that it’s safe to use for flushing your eye, or saline eye drops if you have them handy. Flush your eye with the solution, and try to let the liquid guide any remaining tiny pieces out of your eye. Continue to hold your eyelids wide open to let the solution and any leftover fragments drip out from your eye and socket.You may still feel like you have pieces stuck in your eye, since the fragments could have caused irritation. Use the pieces that you recovered and stored in your lens case to try to judge whether or not any pieces actually remain., If you’re unable to remove lens fragments using pinching or flushing techniques, you might have to visit your eye doctor. Making a quick visit to the doctor might seem like a hassle, but it’s certainly preferable to doing yourself harm by trying to get the broken lens out yourself. Your doctor will have more sensitive tools than you have at your disposal, and will more than likely be able to quickly and easily remove the pieces for you.See your doctor right away if your lens has scratched your eye.

Don’t use your fingernails.,
Steer clear of tweezers.,
Try not to rub your eyes.",How to Remove a Broken Contact Lens2," You might be tempted to use your fingernails to pluck the lens fragments from you eye; however, it’s important to pinch the lens pieces with your fingertips only rather than your nails. Otherwise, you risk doing damage to the surface of your eye.Further, it’s ideal to attempt removing a broken contact with fingers that have trimmed nails to avoid scratching your eye.

, If you’re unable to remove lens fragments with your fingertips, do not attempt to use any tools. Tweezers and similar objects can severely damage the surface of your eye or cause serious infection. Leave the equipment handling to your doctor.Even soft-tipped contact lens tweezers are generally not recommended, especially for removing lens fragments. The risk of causing an abrasion, or scratching the eye surface, is too great.

, Don’t rub your eyes hard if any lens fragments are stuck in your eye. The friction could scratch your cornea, or the eye’s surface. You risk not only doing physical damage, but you open the door to dangerous eye infections. In general, you should avoid rubbing your eyes too much while you’re wearing contact lenses."

Never use a torn lens.,
Handle and maintain your lenses as directed.,
Don’t sleep with your lenses on.",How to Remove a Broken Contact Lens3," Carefully inspect your contacts before using them. Do not use a lens if you notice any tears or warping, no matter how minute they seem. Even using a warped hard lens can be dangerous, as it might alter the shape of your cornea, or the surface of eye that the lens fits onto.Try to keep spare glasses or extra lenses on you when you’re on the go or out of town. This will reduce the temptation or need to use faulty lenses.

, When you remove lenses from your eyes, don’t hold them in between your fingers before placing them in solution. Rather, hold them on a fingertip facing up, so the part that comes in contact with your eye doesn’t touch your finger. This will reduce the risk of weakening the lens or changing its shape, making it less likely to tear or hurt your cornea.Promptly and gently place the lenses in their case after removing them from your eyes. Don’t let lenses dry out, as they won’t completely rehydrate and the risk of tearing will greatly increase.
Always take care closing your case, and make sure you don’t pinch the lenses in the lid.
Don’t put your lenses in your mouth or tongue to lubricate them.
Replace your lenses according to their manufacturer guidelines and replace your case every three months., Your eyes and lenses are prone to drying out while you sleep, and you’re not awake to properly maintain or lubricate them. Rapid eye movement during sleep can also displace lenses or damage the eye surface. This can also increase the risk of serious eye infections.Extended wear contacts should be a conversation between you and your doctor. The FDA has approved overnight wear for some extended wear lenses and this can be done safely when done under the supervision of an eye doctor and with proper compliance to safety and care."

Avoid drying your hands with paper towels, as these tend to leave more fibers on your finger.;
, With her head tilted slightly back, ask her to look forward and then slightly upward. Try not to hover immediately above her eyes; this might cause her to instinctively blink more. Instead, place her shoulder against your side, so she is standing next to you, as opposed to in front of you.

, This will ensure that the contact lens is not inside out. Make sure that the lens you have on your finger corresponds to the correct eye. It is likely that your child may need a different prescription strength in each eye, so make sure you have selected the correct lens for each eye.


Many contact lens cases will have a label for each eye; for example, the case for the right eye's lens might read ""R"" on the lid.

, Your child will probably need to gently pull up the skin of his upper eyelid toward his eyebrow using his index finger in order to keep his eye open for the insertion. The bottom eyelid may also need to be pulled gently down, toward the cheek.

, The lens should stick to the eye almost like a suction cup once it comes in contact with it. Try to center the lens over the iris of the eye.


As you approach the eye, ask your child not to focus on the lens itself as this will increase her risk of blinking before you can properly insert it. Instead, encourage her to look just to the right of your finger, but while still looking upward.
Make sure the lens is well-lubricated with solution so it is not too dry. If the lens is too dry, it might not come easily off your finger as you try to insert it.

, This will help the lens adjust to the curve of the eye. He may need to blink a few additional times to fit the lens. Be sure he does not blink too rapidly because this may cause the lens to fall out.

,, It is important that your child learn how to insert her lenses for herself. Many optometrists will request that your child practice inserting a trial pair of contacts at their office. If your child inserts her contact lenses herself, this will also reduce her desire to blink during the application process.


A recent study found that children between the ages of eight and nine were all successfully able to insert their own contact lenses., Make sure your child knows that he should never clean his contacts with water or saliva; instead, he should only use solutions and disinfectants that have been recommended by his optometrist. He must also properly store his contact lenses in an optometrist-approved solution overnight or when not in use., If your child is wearing daily disposable contacts, make sure that she is properly disposing of the pair each evening and not wearing them over a longer period of time. You should ensure that your child is not sleeping in a pair of contact lenses unless the contacts have been approved for overnight use.

, If your daughter is wearing make up, make sure she knows that she must insert her contact lenses prior to applying cosmetics. You should also look into using hypoallergenic cosmetic and skincare products for your child when she wears contact lenses.

, Is your child very active? Does he participate in many sports or group activities that can be impeded by glasses? Is he worried about breaking her glasses when she is active? 36% of optometrists say that parents request contacts for their children so they can more fully participate in sports.Contacts can also help improve your child's peripheral vision when he participates in sports.

, Do glasses negatively impact your child's self-esteem? Does she have poor self-image because she believes her glasses make her look weird or different? Recent studies have indicated that wearing contact lenses can significantly improve a child's self-esteem and her comfort in participating in group activities., Is your child good at following instructions and carrying out daily chores? Does he make his bed and keep his personal space tidy on a regular basis? If he is responsible and mature, then he will be a good candidate to take care of his contact lenses., Doctors will most often prescribe contact lenses for children between the ages of 10–12. These are often prescribed in conjunction with a pair of prescription glasses; at this age, contacts often serve as a secondary form of vision correction. Approximately 12% of doctors will prescribe contacts for children between the ages of eight and nine and a further 12% will prescribe contact lenses for children younger than eight years old.For children, doctors will often prescribe daily disposable contact lenses to minimize the risk of unhygienic storage and handling. Daily disposable lenses typically cost $100 more than longer wear lenses.
In rare cases, optometrists will prescribe contacts for infants suffering from congenital cataracts.
If your child suffers from seasonal allergies, then she might not be the best candidate for contacts as the lenses may cause additional irritation in the eyes."

Properly care for your contact lenses whenever they’re not in use.,
Wash your hands with soap.,
Remove one contact from its case.,
Place the contact on the index finger you’re most comfortable with using.,
Gently pull your skin away from your eye.,
Move the contact towards your eye calmly and steadily.,
Gently place the contact on your eye.,
Let go of the skin around your eye and blink slowly so as to not dislodge the contact.,
Repeat the process with the other contact.",How to Put in Contact Lenses1," This basically means two things:


Always store your contacts in contact lens solution, unless you're wearing daily disposable lenses. Contact lens solution helps to clean, rinse, and disinfect your lenses.
Dispose of your contact lenses by the recommended date. Most lenses fall into one of three categories: dispose daily, dispose semi-weekly, or dispose monthly. Check your contact lenses for the recommended disposal date and don't wear them longer than that.;
, Rinse thoroughly to get rid of soap residue. Dry your hands with a towel (since paper towels or toilet paper may leave pieces behind) or, if possible, an air dryer.

, Unless the prescription is the same for both, remember to check whether it’s for your right or left eye. Always start with the same eye to avoid mixing up your two contacts. Remember to always handle your contacts gently so you don't rip or damage them.

, Make sure that the contact is sitting hollow-side up on your fingertip with none of the side walls sticking to your finger. Hold your finger at eye-level. If the contact looks like a bowl or a sphere cut in half, it is correct. If the edges are flaring out, then it is inside out.


Make sure to handle the lens on the skin of your finger, not the nail of your fingertip. It might be easier if you put a little bit of solution on your finger where you intend to hold the contact lens.
If it’s a soft contact lens, make sure that it isn’t inside-out. It sounds obvious, but sometimes it's difficult to tell.
While it’s still on your finger, inspect the lens for rips, tears, or debris. If dust or debris is visible, rinse with lens solution.

, Use the index finger of your opposite hand to pull your upper eyelid upward; use the middle finger of your dominant hand (i.e. the one with the contact on it) to pull your lower eyelid downward. As you become more experienced, you’ll be able to do this just by pulling down your lower eyelid.








, Try not to blink or move jerkily. It may help to look upwards. It's also advised to not focus the eye that you're putting the contact into; this will make it easier to place the lens.








, Make sure it is centered over your iris (i.e. the circular, colored part of the eye), gently sliding it over your eyeball if necessary.









If this method is difficult you can also close your eye and look around (up, down, left, and right) to center the lens.

, Take note of any pain or discomfort you may have. If you think that something may be wrong with your contact, remove and fully cleanse it, then try again.








, When finished, pour contact solution from the case into the sink and close the contact case.

You should also put down a towel on your bathroom counter. This will help keep the area dry, and will give you a clean space to set out your contacts before you put them in your eyes.;
, You should always leave your colored contact lenses in their storage case overnight, and the case should be filled to the proper volume with contact-lens solution.


Make sure the contacts are still wet with the cleaning solution before you put them in your eyes. Dry lenses can crack, and will be harmful if applied directly to your eye.

, Both your lens and your finger should be wet with contact-lens solution at this point. Make sure that the lens is balancing in the central part of your finger, with the outside (the colored/printed side) pointed downward.The lens will be soft and malleable. If part of the lens’s circular edge folds down, gently push it back up with your other index finger.
To make sure the lens is right side out, pay careful attention to the edges. If the edges turn up like a bowl it is correct. It the top edges flare out then it is inside out.

, Your eyelids will need to be wide open for you to insert the contact lens. It’s most effective to use the thumb and index finger on your non-dominant hand to hold the lenses open, so that your dominant hand can place the lens over your eye.


For example, if you’re using your right hand to put the lens in your eye, hold the eyelids open with your left hand. Place your thumb on your lower lid and index finger on your upper lid, and gently pull your fingers apart.

, The lens should be centered in your eye at this point, and should have adhered itself to your eye due to its wet surface and concave shape. Blink your eye to adjust and center the lens.If you find it difficult to look straight ahead while placing the lens in your eye (if you flinch when your finger gets close to your eye, for example), try looking up or to the side. Make sure that the lens is centered after you blink.

, It’s common practice to put the lens in your right eye first, using your left hand to hold your eyelids apart. Once the first lens is in, use your right hand to put the second lens in your left eye.If you are left-handed, you may find it easier to put in the left lens first.

Clean the lenses after wearing them.,
Keep the lenses in the contact-lens case.,
Immerse the lenses in contact-cleaner solution.",How to Put in Colour Contacts2," When you take your colored contacts out after wearing them all day, thoroughly wash them before storing them for the night. To wash the lenses, hold them under lightly running water and rub with your fingers.If sticky particles (for example, bits of make-up) are stuck to the lenses, squirt a little contact-lens solution on the lens and gently rub the spot.Never use your finger nails to clean the lens.

, This lens case should have been provided to you by your optometrist when you first purchased the colored contact lenses.The lens case is specifically designed to protect the lenses. Whenever you’re not wearing your colored contacts, keep them in the case.


Store the case in a safe location where it won’t get lost or damaged, such as your medicine cabinet.
If you lose or damage the protective case, a replacement can be bought at any pharmacy.

, The lenses should be completely covered in the contact solution (usually a type of saline solution) when stored overnight.This solution will cleanse the contact lenses, and also prevent them from drying out.
Never fill the lens case with water. Water will damage the lenses, and can be painful to your eyes when you insert the contacts."

Decide which type of colored lens you’d like.,
Select a lens that complements your existing eye color.,
Pick a lens that fits with your natural skin tones.",How to Put in Colour Contacts3," Before you purchase any type of contact lenses—including colored lenses—you’ll need to visit your optometrist and sit through an eye exam. This will let the doctor measure your vision and write a proper prescription. Let the doctor know that you’re interested in purchasing color contact lenses—they may have recommendations concerning which brands to avoid.Let your doctor know that you’re interested in contact lenses specifically, as there may be additional tests that will need to be performed, that the doctor wouldn’t perform if you were only getting a prescription for eyeglasses.Never purchase colored contact lenses from a mall kiosk or other informal vending location. These are illegal, cheaply made, and could seriously damage your eyes., Colored lenses come in three different types, and each has its own advantages. Before you select a lens type, you’ll need to decide to what extent you want to mask or change the natural color of your own eyes.Visibility tint lenses are nearly clear, but with a slight green or blue tint added. The coloration is largely to make the lenses easier to see during insertion and removal.
Enhancement tint lenses are translucent, and meant to enhance and deepen your natural eye color. These lenses are recommended if you have light-colored eyes (light blue or green), and wish to deepen your eye color.
Opaque tint lenses are not translucent and are used to entirely mask your natural eye color. If you want to change your eye color completely, you’ll need to use opaque lenses.

, Many people choose to change their eye color to one of the other three main eye colors: blue, brown, and green. If you have lighter-colored eyes naturally, consider a lens that slightly darkens your eye color.If your eyes are naturally dark, choose an opaque-tint lens; otherwise, the lens color will be ineffective to mask your natural eye color.
Colored contacts are also available in gray. This color will mute and darken your natural color, but shouldn’t erase it altogether.
If you’d like to have a deliberately dramatic look, choose a colored lens dissimilar to your natural color.

, This will help your colored lenses appear more natural and flattering. If you have warmer skin tones (yellow or gold undertones), and lighter brown or blonde hair, consider lenses that are light brown, hazel, or honey colored. If your skin tones are cooler (blue undertones) and your hair is darker as well, choose a blue or violet lens.If you’re going to be changing your appearance by wearing a colored contact lens, consider where you’ll be wearing the contact lens. While wearing a bright-yellow cat’s eye lens may be appropriate for your social life, wearing one in a conservative workplace would be discouraged.

Add the information online.,
Buy in bulk.,
Don't accept other brands.,
Check to make sure the lenses are right.",How to Purchase Contact Lenses Online," You're usually prescribed a particular brand or type of lens by your optometrist, and you should know what that is before you start searching for a place to buy lenses. Not every place sells all lenses, so you need to narrow down places by the brand you need to buy., Not every place that sells contact lenses on the internet provides the quality and care needed for such an important product. Make sure to evaluate the websites you're looking at, and pick one that has good reviews and a quality website.If you're not sure which one to choose, as your optometrist for a recommendation or two.
Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure the website you're looking at has a good rating.
Check for good customer service. That is, is it easy to contact the company if you have a problem? Make sure the website presents multiple ways to get in contact, such as by email, phone, chatting service, and/or mail.
Look at the return policy. With something like contact lenses, it's important to know that you can return them if there's a problem. Check the website to make sure the company you choose has a decent policy.

, Once you find some credible stores, it's time to compare prices. Try searching for your lens on each site to see how their prices line up. You can also use a comparison shopping site, such as Google Shopping to compare prices.Check for shipping costs and added fees. Some websites add additional fees at the end of the process making the contacts appear cheap at the start but end up costing more in the end.
Don't forget to compare larger quantities, too, as that can change the prices.

, When shopping locally, smaller is often better; however, when it comes to shopping for contacts online, bigger companies are better able to serve their customers. That's because bigger companies have more lenses in stock, plus they have the resources to provide adequate customer service and exchanges., When buying new contacts, start with a prescription that is up to date. Your eyes change over time, and a more recent prescription will correct your vision better. Plus, your optometrist or ophthalmologist can keep an eye on any problems that may develop in your eyes.In some states, prescriptions expire after a year. In others, it's two. If your state doesn't have a law, federal law says they expire after a year. If your prescription is expired, you will not legally be able to buy contacts.

, When you get your prescription, make sure you have all the information you need. You will, of course, need things like your name and the date of your exam. You will also need the date when you got your prescription, as well as the contact information for your optometrist's office.You'll also need to look for the power, the base curve, and the diameter (when needed), as well as the material/manufacturer of the lens.
The power will include the sphere, cylinder (if applicable), and axis (if applicable).

, When ordering contacts, the website will have a place where you enter each piece of information. Be careful to enter each piece of information exactly correct.Every contact lens company is required by law to check your prescription with your optometrist, so if you make a mistake, it should be corrected.Still, be as accurate as possible to ensure speedy service and no mistakes.

, Buying in bulk can help save you money. For instance, instead of buying a three-month supply, consider buying a six-month or year supply. You'll certainly save on shipping, and many places will offer you a discount on your contacts, too., Sometimes, a retailer will try to substitute a different brand for the kind you normally buy. This should be a red flag since a contact prescription is specific for the brand. A seller of contacts shouldn't be substituting brands.Don't buy contacts from a different brand without first consulting your doctor.

, When you receive your lenses in the mail, look for the information that tells you about the lenses you received. Check it against your prescription to make sure all the numbers are right. If they're not, call the company and ask them to fix the problem."

Use soap and running water.
When drying your hands, be sure to use a clean towel. You do not want to get bacteria from a dirty towel on your hands after washing them.;
, Open the package according to its instructions. Usually, contacts come in individual pockets and you have to peel off the plastic covering the top of each individual pocket.Carefully slide the lens on your index finger.
Slide the lens upward until you remove it from its package.

, Hold the lens on the tip of your finger. In a well-lit area, bring the lens close to your eyes to examine it. Make sure the lens is damage-free before putting it in your eye.The lens should be in a semi-circular shape. The edge of the lens should be smooth and not have a lip. A lens with a lip is inside out, and you will have to turn it over before placing it in your eye.
You should also make sure the contact lens is free of dirt or hairs, and does not have any tears.

, Start with your right eye. Keep your contact on your index finger. Take your middle finger and use it to pull down your lower eyelid.If you've never put in a contact before, use a mirror here. Look straight into a mirror while you put your contact in place.

, Watch your hand with your left eye. Move your index finger towards your eye. Place the contact directly onto your right iris. Press the contact down until all corners of the contact are touching your eye., This will secure the contact in place, and also smooth out any air bubbles. Keep blinking until you can see clearly with the contact in place., As soon as the first contact is comfortably in place, move on to the next one. Repeat the exact same process, only with your left eye.Putting contacts in can be very tricky at first, so don't be surprised if takes several tries to get your contacts in at first.

Once you have a good grip on the lens, pull it away from your eye.Make sure to keep your grip gentle. It's very easy to tear a contact lens, and you do not want to do so in the process of removing one.

, You should never reuse contact lens solution. Each night when removing your contacts, place them in fresh solution. Reusing the solution from the night before can expose your contact lenses to bacteria. This increases your risk of an eye infection., Some contacts are designed for extended wear. However, you should still remove your contacts overnight as often as possible. The longer you leave your contacts in, the greater your risk for an eye infection. Whenever possible, remove your contacts overnight., You should only use contact lens solution to wet your lenses. Saliva and tap water contain a lot of bacteria. You do not want to expose your eyes to bacteria, as this can greatly increase your risk of an eye infection.Carry a small container of contact solution when you when your out. This way, you can quickly disinfect your contact lenses if they fall out.

, Each type of contact lens is slightly different, and there will be different specific instructions regarding care. Some contact lenses need to be replaced more often than others.

Ask your optometrist for trial contact lenses.,
Be creative.,
Get copies of your prescription.,
Shop around.",How to Get Free Contact Lenses1," Optometrists will often have free trial lenses that they can give you following your eye exam. There are different brands and types of contact lenses (ex. Daily’s, two-week lenses etc) and your optometrist should be able to provide you with a trial pair for the different types/brands., If you keep asking your optometrist for free trial contacts they may become suspicious after a while, so you may want to come up with other reasons why you need a free pair. Before trying this, understand that it requires you to lie to your doctor about your comfort or vision. Lying to your doctor is not a good idea for a number of reasons, one being that it creates conflicting data that makes it harder to be fit properly with lenses. Your optometrist will likely be happy to give you some free contacts to try and find the perfect fit for you, and after that you should accept that you need to pay for them. If they are too expensive, ask your doctor about coupons, less expensive brands, or stick to glasses. If you do decide to go this route, however, here are a few reasons you may need to test out new contact lenses:


You can tell your optometrist that your last trial pair did not fit properly and bothered your eyes.
You could say that your current contacts are prone to rips and tears and you want to find a more durable lens.
You are interested in testing out prescription color contact lenses to freshen up your look and want a trial pair.
You find the daily contact lenses you currently use a bit of a hassle and would like to test out the two week lenses (or vice versa).

, Ask your optometrist for a copy of your prescription. In order to get contacts from another optometrist or online you need to have a copy of your prescription. If you don’t have your prescription you may need to pay for another eye exam. Your eye doctor should readily give you a copy of your prescription upon request — providing a copy of your contact lens prescription is required by law., Once you have your prescription you can shop around to different optometrists and retailers for free trial contact lenses.


It works best with contacts that are at least two-week wear. Think about it — is it really worth it to do a round-robin with seven different opticians for one free trial pair of dailies?

Look for coupons and promotions.,
Complete an online search for free contact lenses.,
Contact the manufacturer directly.",How to Get Free Contact Lenses2," Some contact manufacturers will offer coupons online for free trial lenses. Once you have printed the coupon you can take it to an optometrist along with your prescription to receive free contact lenses.For example, Acuvue often gives out free trial lenses., You will find many different rebates and coupons to help you access free contact lenses.


For example, some retailers will offer a promotion for a buy one and get one free on contact lenses. Although this will require a payment you will still receive some contact lenses for free.

, It never hurts to send an email to a specific manufacturer asking for a trial pair of contact lenses. Even if you can not find a promotion online you can always try contacting the manufacturer. You never know they may send you a few free pairs to test out.


Remember, however, that contact lenses are considered medical devices and must be prescribed by a licensed physician. The manufacturer will need your prescription to do this.

Always consult a licensed eye care professional.,
Compare hard and soft contact lens options.,
Follow proper guidance and instructions.,
Watch for common adjustment problems.,
Wear and remove contacts as often as directed.,
Clean your contacts properly.,
Clean and replace your case as recommended.,
Give your eyes time to adjust.",How to Get Used to Wearing Contacts," Contacts are a medical device and should be treated as such. This is true even if your eyesight is fine and you are only interested in turning your brown eyes into “baby blues” with colored lenses.Taking the time to have a thorough eye exam by a licensed practitioner is the best way to ensure that you are suited to wearing contacts. It also helps ensure that you get the type that will be most useful and comfortable for you, and that you will have access to proper guidance and care as needed.
If you have dry eye or allergies, contacts may not be the best choice for you.;
, Contact lens technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, but most contacts can basically be separated into the categories “soft” and “hard” (often called rigid gas permeable, or RGP).Soft contacts are more flexible and fragile. Some are meant to last only a day, while others can be used safely for months. They are generally considered to be more comfortable to wear.
Hard (RGP) contacts have a sturdier construction and are meant to last longer, even up to a couple of years. They can be more uncomfortable and harder to adjust to at the start, but generally are considered to provide sharper vision.
If having the sharpest possible vision is important to you, or you have specific eye needs, you and your eye doctor may lean towards RGP contacts. Otherwise, most people are willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of vision clarity for the relative comfort and convenience of soft lenses.
You may need to try different options to find what is right for you. Your eye doctor should be more than willing to guide you through this process.
Other categories of contacts include a rigid lens attached to a soft outer rim or skirt.

, When you find the contacts that work for you, the best way to make the adjustment period go smoothly is to closely follow all advice provided by your licensed provider and the instructions included with your particular brand of lenses.Your eye doctor will want you to come in for a follow-up appointment to ensure that your eyes are adjusting to the contacts. You should keep up with regular check-ups beyond that as well.
The care and cleaning tips provided in this article are generally applicable to most contacts, but always follow the instructions of your eye doctor and the manufacturer first.

, Some people are lucky and adjust to their new contacts within a day, but for many it can take several days or even a couple of weeks.


Essentially, your eyes have to adjust to having foreign objects pressed up against them. During the adjustment period, irritation, tears, blinking, light sensitivity, and occasional blurry vision are common.You may find yourself suffering from dry eyes, cornea problems (scratching, infections, or swelling), allergic reactions (usually to your cleaning solution), uncomfortable deposits on the lenses, or eye or eyelid inflammation. Patience and proper cleaning should clear up these issues most of the time, but always consult with your eye doctor.If your contacts continue to give you problems, talk to your doctor about trying a different brand. Different companies use different materials and technology to make their contacts and switching brands may help with comfort.
A small percentage of people will find that they cannot comfortably or safely wear contact lenses, due to having overly sensitive eyes or other issues. People who have frequent eye infections, severe allergic reactions, insufficient tear production, are regularly exposed to dust or chemical fumes, or are unable (or unwilling) to care properly for their lenses may not be suited to contacts., There are contacts that need to be removed every night, and those that can be left in for long stretches of time without cleaning. The important thing is to know and follow the wear recommendations for your particular lenses.Especially when you are new to the process, removing and cleaning contacts can seem like a time-consuming chore. For comfort, effectiveness, and safety, however, always remove and clean or replace your contacts on the schedule recommended for that specific brand and by your eye care professional.
Your eye doctor may recommend a “breaking in” period for a week or two when you start wearing contacts. During this time you will wear them for longer stretches each day to slowly acclimate to them. This is more common with hard (RGP) lenses., Your eye care professional should provide you with detailed instructions on how to put your new contacts in, take them out, and clean them. Instructions on how to put contacts in are fairly consistent across types and brands, but refer to your brand’s instructions or website for particular details.Cleaning (non-disposable) lenses properly is essential to limiting the chance of infection and other eye problems. The basics of the process are usually the same regardless of lens type:Wash your hands with a mild soap (without moisturizers) and dry them with a clean, lint-free towel.
Remove one lens, douse it with the recommended contact solution, and rub the lens in your palm with your finger (even if marketed as “no rub”).
Rinse with solution for as long as recommended. You normally need to repeat the cleaning and rinsing process for RGP lenses.
Place the lens in a clean case, then fill it with fresh solution (don’t “top off” any existing solution), and keep in the case for as long as recommended. Repeat with the other lens.
If the recommendations for your lenses vary from this list, follow them.



, You can clean your contacts perfectly right, but if you store them in a dirty case, your chances of infection or other problems will be greatly increased.To clean your case: dump out the old solution; rub the inside with clean fingers; fill each well with solution, then discard it; let it air dry upside-down with the lids off.Do this cleaning process (or that recommended by your eye doctor) as frequently as advised. Replace your case every three months or as recommended.
On related notes: Never let the tip of your solution bottle touch anything. This may permit germ transmission. Also, never use tap water on contacts or accessories. It can contain the long-lasting acanthamoeba bacteria, which can be particularly harmful to the eyes.

, Patience is a great virtue when adjusting to contact lenses. As mentioned, very few people are unable to wear contacts, so the odds are good that you can overcome any discomfort that you experience at first.


Your eye doctor may recommend the use of a special protein removal product to deal with discomfort, or the use of rewetting drops to moisten dry eyes. If you show signs of an allergic reaction to your contact solution, a switch to a preservative-free product may be all that is required.The newer silicone hydrogel lenses and older technology often found in generic solutions can cause redness and irritation. Follow your doctor's recommendation on which solution to use to prevent this.If you are using monovision lenses (where one eye has a contact meant to improve distance vision, while the other aids close-up vision), you can expect a somewhat longer adjustment period. A typical adjustment period for monovision is about two weeks. But in the end, most people adjust to these just fine as well."

Pick a safe eye drop.,
Wash your hands.,
Prepare the bottle.,
Position your dominant hand.,
Angle your head and eyes correctly.,
Squeeze the bottle.,
Close your eyes.,
Eat fish.,
Decide whether you need a supplement or not.,
Do not sleep in your contacts.,
Look into contacts designed to prevent dry eyes.",How to Moisten Contacts," The best way to choose an eye drop or artificial tear solution that won’t damage your contacts or eyes is to talk to your optometrist. Drops that are incompatible with contacts can either change the color of your lenses or ruin them altogether. Keep your eye drops on hand for emergencies. (You may want to buy several bottles so you can keep some in your car, your office, your purse, your backpack, etc.)Drops created for this purpose are frequently marketed as “rewetting drops.”
Look for the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in the ingredients list of your eye drops. It can cause hypersensitivity reactions and is toxic to the epithelial surface, and can be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Avoid using any drops containing BAK or other preservatives.
Avoid products that say they “get the red out.” These products constrict the tiny blood vessels in the white part of your eye and get rid of redness, but they do nothing to alleviate dryness.
Never put anything into your eyes unless the label says “ophthalmic.”;
, Even though you’re not going to be touching your eyes or your contacts, you’ll be putting your fingers very close to your eyes and eyelids. Wash with soap and water to get rid of dirt and bacteria. Dry with a clean towel., Shake the eye drop container gently if the directions say to do so. Take off the cap and place it on a clean tissue out of your way. (You don’t want to introduce bacteria to the bottle when you put the cap back on later.)Avoid touching the dropper tip. You don’t want to get it dirty, even with invisible bacteria.

, Hold the bottom of the bottle in the palm of your dominant with your fingers around the sides. Turn it upside down in your hand. Hold the back of your thumb (on your dominant hand) against your forehead right above the eye that you’re going to put drops into first., Tip your head backwards. Keep both eyes open. Stare at a fixed point on the ceiling. Pull down your lower lid. The goal is to create a tiny bucket for the drop to fall into.Don’t let the dropper touch your eye. Hold it about 3/4 of an inch above your eye.
Don’t let it touch your eyelashes or eyelid either.
Some people find it easier to do this lying down or in front of a mirror. If you lie down, try to tilt your head forward a little bit so that you can still create a bucket with your lower lid.

, The goal is to only release one drop, though two is usually fine. (Double check your bottle to be sure.) Aim for the little bucket you’ve created by pulling your lower lid downward., Don’t squeeze them shut — just close gently. Gently blot with a clean tissue around your closed eye if you want to. Don’t scrub at your eye, either — just dab around the edges to remove excess moisture.You can gently press on the inner part of your eye for about thirty seconds if you want to. With your eyes closed, press one or two fingers against your lid on the side of your eye closest to your nose. This will keep the drops around your eye and contact for longer.
If you feel you need to put more drops in the same eye, wait about five minutes before doing so.

, The omega-3 fatty acids in fish help improve the quality of your tears. Good quality tears don’t evaporate as quickly, so your eyes will stay moist for longer, even if you have contacts in for a while., If you’re not producing enough tears or your tears evaporate too rapidly, it’s possible that a supplement may help you. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before adding supplements to your diet.Your doctor may recommend flaxseed oil. Like fish, this oil is full of omega-3 fatty acids. Some evidence suggests that taking 1 to 2 grams of flaxseed per day can help people whose eyes don’t produce enough tears.
Store flaxseed oil in a cool, dark place. Look for cold-pressed flaxseed oil, as heat can destroy the nutritional value., Your corneas need air. When you close your eyes or when you wear contacts, your eyes get a little bit less air than they normally would, so combining the two is a bad idea. The lack of air can lead to infection or cause your contact to get stuck in your eye (ouch!), so don’t risk it, even for a quick nap.If you accidentally fall asleep in your contacts, you should immediately put artificial tears in when you wake up. Don’t pull your contacts out until you have moistened your eyes thoroughly. You could scratch your cornea!
There are a few brands of contact lenses approved by the FDA for overnight wear. Check with your eye doctor if you’re interested in these.

, Contacts have different water content, so you can ask your doctor about switching to one with more water. Some brands of contacts also offer a silicone version, which can stay moist longer."

Understand that your eye color is genetic.,
Know that changes in eye color may signify disease or illness.,
Understand that you can’t permanently change your eye color.",How to Get Blue Eyes1," Just like your hair and skin color, the color of your iris’ is genetic. That means that unless you break down your genetic code or cell structure, your eye color cannot be changed permanently. The color of your eyes is determined by the amount of melanin that your iris’ contain: very little melanin gives blue eyes, while lots of melanin gives brown eyes.


All babies have blue eyes when they’re born, because their body hasn’t created very much melanin yet.
There are genetic mutations which cause some people to have two different colored eyes or both eyes with multiple colors.;
, If you notice that your eyes are changing color on their own - especially from brown to blue - you should seek medical attention immediately. Changing eye color is a symptom of many illnesses, some of which may cause damage to your eyes leading to blindness. Although it may be exciting to have a new eye color, you should always contact an eye doctor if the change happens naturally., Although there are few surgeries available in some parts of the world that claim to change eye color, there is no strictly permanent way to change it. As a result of being genetic, you can only truly change your eye color by using superficial means. Surgery may alter it, but studies haven’t shown how long it actually lasts, and what the long-term health effects are.


Before taking any ‘permanent’ measures, you should always take some time to seriously consider the pros/cons.
Test out non-permanent blue eye options before doing something drastic, such as surgery.

Use blue contact lenses.,
Change up your makeup.,
Photoshop your eyes blue.,
Change your emotional state.",How to Get Blue Eyes2," The only safe and 100% proven way to get blue eyes is to use blue colored contact lenses. Contact lenses are thin sheets of plastic you wear in your eyes, to cover up the natural iris and give the illusion of a different color. The nice thing about contact lenses is that they are cheap, and come in many different shades of blue. This makes it easy to test-drive multiple colors and types of lenses to find the right ones for you.


Keep in mind that certain contacts and certain colors may blur your vision and make it foggy.
You will need to learn how to put in your contacts. Depending on whether they are hard or soft, the difficulty of putting them in varies from person to person, not to mention the type of contact.
If you wear prescription glasses or contacts, you have the option of getting prescription colored contacts.

, If you wear makeup, you can change the colors you wear to either bring out natural blue undertones in your iris’, or add blue to your eyes if your eyes are dark. If you have some blue undertones in your eyes, look for a copper or gold eyeshadow. The warm hues of the bronze-y shadow will bring out the blue highlights in your iris’. If you have brown eyes, try wearing a cool blue eyeshadow; you’ll add the color near your eyes, which will create an illusion of blue-ish eyes from a distance.


Apply the eyeshadow using a shadow brush over your entire eyelid, and on the outer-corner of your lower lash-line.
You can use blue eyeliner for a similar effect.

, If you want to test out blue eyes to see what they would look like, or you’re just interested in making your eyes more blue in your photos, you can use photoshop to alter the color. Although this doesn’t technically change the color of your eyes in real life, it does give you the opportunity to show off baby blues in photos, and try on different shades to see if you like it.


You can use other photo editing programs outside of photoshop to change the color of your eyes.

, When you get angry, sad, or excited, your pupils will contract, which ‘enlarges’ the size of your iris’s. As a result, your eyes appear brighter and more colorful than they do when you’re simply contented. If you have any blue undertones in your eyes, working up your emotions will bring them out naturally. Plus, if you cry, your eyes will get slightly red which contrasts with the blue that might be present, giving your eyes more of a blue appearance.Any change in your hormones or pupil size will slightly alter the appearance of your eyes.
This technique will only make eyes appear blue if they’re green or hazel, and have a bit of blue in them already.

Get a special laser surgery.,
Get iris implants.,
Go on a bowel cleanse.,
Wait it out.",How to Get Blue Eyes3," Although it hasn’t been approved for use in the United States, there is a type of laser therapy on the market that will permanently make your eyes blue. The treatment works by using a laser to burn out the top layer of melanin in your eyes, revealing blue iris’ underneath. As a result of being a relatively new treatment, there is no word on what the long-time health effects of it is. However, using a laser on your eyes under any circumstances can be dangerous, and should be avoided if at all possible.Because no long-term studies have been conducted, it’s hard to know if the melanin that was removed every returns later in life.

, A treatment originally developed for people suffering from serious eye problems, you can have a small silicon disc implanted over your iris to change the color of your eye. Almost like a permanent set of contact lenses, the colored disc will turn your eyes bright blue. However, there are serious downsides to the procedure: more than one person has gone blind as a result of seeking out the procedure for cosmetic reasons. Iris implants are typically only used on patients who are going blind or who have serious cataracts, and should be avoided for the sole purpose of changing your eye color.Iris implants aren’t available cosmetically inside the United States.

, Although this method hasn’t been scientifically proven, many people claim that cleansing their bowels has lead to a semi-permanent change in eye color. The theory is that when you change what you eat/drink and what your bowels take in, your hormones change, therefore altering the melanin production in your eyes. Talk to your doctor about finding a bowel cleanse that is healthy and safe based on your lifestyle.You should never do a bodily cleanse without first speaking to your physician about the possible outcomes.
Don’t drastically change your diet for the purpose of altering your eye color, as this could have other unintentional negative results.

, If you’ve ever looked at the eyes of someone who is quite old in age, you’ll notice that they all tend to be a milky blue-ish hue. That’s because as you age, your body doesn’t produce melanin as heavily as when you are young and in prime physical condition. As a result, eyes turn a dark blue color. If nothing else, waiting until you’re in the later years of your life will give you blue eyes that you otherwise might not have.

Prescription contact lenses are used on people who are near-sighted, far-sighted, or have an astigmatism. Prescription colored lenses change the color of your eye while also correcting your vision.Color lenses will not be able to treat astigmatism, however, so your vision might be blurry if you have this condition.

Plano contact lenses are purely for cosmetic purposes. These contact lenses do not alter your vision in any way.;
, You can either choose an everyday color that mimics the look of a natural eye, or spice up your halloween costume with patterned lenses.


Everyday lenses come in a variety of colors, including blue, green, hazel, brown, and purple.
Costume contact lenses come in all sorts of crazy colors and patterns like spirals, checkers, at-eyes, zebra, Xs, white-out, and even tie-dye!

, Both prescription and plano contact lenses are classified as medical devices by the FDA, and you will need to be given a prescription., Remember that not everybody can safely wear contacts, as it depends on the shape and health of your eye.


Your optometrist will give you proper instructions on how to insert and take care of your lenses to avoid damaging them and harming your eyes.

Be prepared when going out.",How to Find Contact Lenses Lost on the Carpet," When a contact lens falls out, time is an issue. The longer you wait, the more susceptible the lens will be to germs and damage. Also, any motion on the floor can cause the lens to shift and become more difficult to find. As soon as a lens falls out, begin looking. Do not move around too much from the original spot where the lens was lost. Remove your shoes so you won't crush or damage the lens if you accidentally step on it.;
, A good trick to find small objects lost in the carpet is wrapping a nylon sock, panty hose, or other material around the nozzle of a vacuum. This way, when you turn the vacuum on the suction will still work but the lens will not be sucked into the vacuum.


Use a pair of old socks or panty hose. Wrap them around the nozzle of a vacuum.Slowly move the nozzle over the part of the carpet where you dropped the contact lens. Then, examine the socks or pantyhose to see if the contact lens is stuck to them.You may have to go over quite a bit of carpet before you're successful. Contact lenses are lightweight and sometimes fall far from where you were standing., A flashlight can also be used to find missing items. As contact lenses may reflect off the light, using a flashlight can be particularly helpful. It can make the lens more visible.


Turn off all the lights in your house and pull any blinds closed. Try to get the room as dark as possible.Take a flashlight and lie it down horizontally on the floor. Rotate the flashlight slowly, sort of like a lighthouse, until you find the contact lens., Contact lenses can cause eye irritation if they're cracked or torn. Once you've located the contact lens, take it into a bright room and examine it under light. Look for any cracks or tears. If the lens is damaged, do not try to put it in as this can cause eye irritation. Replace it with a new lens or wear your glasses., Once you've made sure your contact lens is damage free, you'll need to clean it. You do not want to put anything in your eye that could contain bacteria or debris.


If possible, disinfect your contact overnight by putting it in a case with solution. If you need your lens back in immediately, wash it thoroughly with solution before putting it back in your eye.Do not use saliva or tap water to clean your contact lens. These liquids have bacteria that can lead to eye infections. Always go with solution specifically made for contact lenses., When going out, you should be prepared in the event a contact falls out. Always carry your glasses, spare lenses, and solution. You do not want to end up vision impaired while at work, school, or running errands."

Take appropriate steps to prevent an eye infection.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them before handling your contact lenses.Bacteria from your day-to-day activities can easily accumulate on your hands throughout the day, so washing well prior to inserting or removing your contact lenses is key to preventing infection.

,
Clean your lenses according to the manufacturer's instructions and follow the guidelines given by your doctor.Use fresh cleaning (disinfecting) solution each time your lenses are cleaned and stored.,

Avoid sleeping while wearing your contact lenses.Sleeping with contact lenses in increases the chance of infection, as well as scratches or damage to your cornea.,
Avoid swimming, bathing, or showing with contact lenses in.There can be bacteria in the water (or, in the case of a shower, it can cause bacteria from your skin or elsewhere to more easily get into your eyes) so it is advised to remove your contacts anytime you are in water.,
Recognize signs and symptoms of an eye infection.,
Know that the choice of treatment depends upon the causes of your eye infection.Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, viral infections with anti-viral medications, and fungal infections with anti-fungals.,
Understand that occasionally steroid drops are prescribed for your eyes in addition to treating the underlying infection.This depends upon the severity of your infection, as topical steroids can sometimes be useful to diminish inflammation and redness in you eye(s).

",How to Help Prevent Eye Infections for Contact Lens Users," For instance, it is important to have regular eye examinations.This way, your doctor can make sure you have contact lenses that fit well, and can also evaluate the overall health of your eyes and screen for any possible infections.


It is also important to replace contact lenses as often as prescribed by your eye care provider.;
,, Be sure to never re-use old solution or mix a new solution with the old one. Never use saline solution to disinfect lenses.

, Replace your storage cases once every three months.

, Even the ""extended wear' contact lenses are best to remove at night, as it is still possible to get an infection with them.

,

Excessive tearing
Eye pain
Sensitivity to light
The sensation of having something in your eye
Swelling, unusual redness, or irritation in the eye.

,


The most common form of treatment is prescription eyedrops given to you by your doctor.He or she will give you instructions of how many drops to put in each eye how often, and an expected time-frame for recovery. The eye drop prescription will, of course, be tailored to the diagnosis of what type of eye infection you have.
If you do not get better within a few days to a week (or if your symptoms get worse at any time), book a follow-up appointment with your doctor to rule out that nothing more serious is going on.

Dry your hands with a clean towel.Disinfect your hands with at least 60% alcohol hand sanitizer if you are in a pinch.

, Decorative lenses do not usually come in daily disposable form. This means that you probably store your lenses in solution when you’re not wearing them. Taking your lenses out of the case and rinsing them before insertion can remove any lingering bacteria on the lenses as well as provide a bit extra moisture to your eyes.Take out one of your decorative lenses and place it in your clean palm. Rub it gently with one finger and some saline or disinfecting solution.
Avoid using water or saliva to rinse off your lenses, which can cause an infection or other serious injury to your eyes.
Throw away any leftover solution in your case so that you can refill it when you remove your contacts again.

, If you have prescription decorative lenses, never share them with another person. Even if the person appears healthy, this can expose your eyes to allergens, bacteria, and viruses that cause eye infections and injuries including vision loss.Respond politely if someone asks to wear your decorative lenses. For example, “I’m really sorry Suki, but I got these from my doctor. They are specially fitted to my eyes.”
Avoid borrowing contacts from other people, which can also cause infection and injury.

, Your eyes are very delicate. Wearing decorative contacts can make you more susceptible to infections. Seek immediate medical attention if you have any signs of eye infection including:Redness
Eye pain that doesn’t go away
Decrease in vision

, Remember that you should treat decorative lenses just like regular contacts.If you have any pain or discomfort when inserting or wearing your decorative lenses, take them out immediately. It might ruin your look, but removal is preferable to discomfort and possible injury or infection., It’s important to have clean hands when you insert your lenses, as well as when you take them out. This can minimize your risk of an eye infection or other injury.Remember to use warm water and soap to wash your hands. Dry them with a clean towel.

, Your contact lens case needs saline disinfecting solution in order to properly store your contacts overnight. Refill the case with your preferred solution to just below the lip. This can ensure that your lenses are properly disinfected and don’t dry out overnight, which can also cause injury to your eyes., Most eye doctors will give you instructions for cleaning and disinfecting your lenses. This includes what types of cleaning and disinfecting solutions you should use and well as how best to use the products. If your doctor suggested a specific brand, you can also follow the packaging instructions. Many cleaning and disinfecting instructions include:


Rinsing off the contact
Rubbing it gently with a finger
Allowing it to sit in a solution for a specified time

, Even if you are tired, never sleep in your decorative lenses. This can increase your risk of an eye infection or other injury.Ask your doctor if your specific type of decorative contacts come in extended wear. These may allow you to wear them longer and while you’re asleep.

, Every pair of contacts has an expiration date. Ask your eye doctor how often you should replace your decorative contact lenses. The required time may be every day or once a year. Not replacing your lenses as often as necessary can increase your risk of eye infections and injuries.Consider replacing your decorative lenses if you’ve worn them and had an eye infection. They can minimize your risk of contracting another infection.
Replace your lens case at least once every three months.

, In rare cases, you may have sudden loss of vision, persistent blurred vision, eye pain, redness, or swelling when wearing decorative lenses. If this happens, get immediate medical attention. This can minimize and treat any damage to your eyes as a result of your decorative lenses."

Redirect air vents and close the driver’s side window.,
Cover your eyes while driving.,
Use lubricating drops.,
Try alternate types of contacts.",How to Drive With Contact Lenses1," If your contacts and eyes tend to get dry or uncomfortable while driving, excessive airflow over the contacts may be the culprit.Simply reducing airflow into your face may be all it takes to limit this problem. Keep moving air from vents and open windows away from your eyes.
If your eyes get itchy, this may be a sign of allergies. This may be better treated with an allergy drop like Zaditor.;
, No, of course this does not mean to drive blindfolded or play “peek-a-boo” with the surrounding traffic! Rather, the goal is to block airflow from passing over and drying the contacts without impairing vision.During the daytime, this effect can be achieved by wearing sunglasses. Consider polarized lenses to reduce glare.


Sunglasses don’t work so well at night, obviously, but you could try clear plastic safety glasses if you’re more concerned with comfort than fashion. Goggles are probably going too far, and may limit your peripheral vision anyway.
The vision benefits of non-prescription night-driving glasses are debatable, but they will help reduce airflow., Whenever your eyes start to feel dried out, use eye drops approved by your eye doctor for use with your contacts. Make sure that the eye drops you are using are safe for contact lenses.Don’t try to put drops in your eyes while driving! Pull over for a minute.
While on the subject, never try to adjust, fix, or find a wayward contact while driving. Always stop to make necessary adjustments, and have a backup pair of contacts or glasses handy.

, Contacts today generally come in either the soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP) varieties. Several companies produce multiple types of each.No single type or brand is clearly better at preventing dry eyes while driving, so you may need to undertake a trial-and-error process.Consult with your eye care professional about trying a different lens type or brand. You can also consider options like glasses or surgery, depending on your vision needs.Ask about new ""water gradient"" lenses, which claim to be more comfortable and better for dry eyes.If your contacts improve your vision but are not consistently comfortable, the benefits will be significantly reduced. Clarity and comfort are both important when you are behind the wheel.

Drive with contacts as recommended and required.,
Take care with multifocal contacts for night driving.,
Keep your prescription up-to-date.,
Check for other sources of glare or clouding.",How to Drive With Contact Lenses2," Always follow your prescribing eye doctor’s advice about when to wear your contacts (or other corrective lenses). If she says to wear them all the time, or always when driving, do so.


If you need corrective eyewear to see clearly, you will likely be required by law to wear them when driving. Otherwise, your driving privileges could be suspended.
Some people worry that monovision contacts — where the contact in the dominant eye is calibrated for distant objects, and the weaker eye for close objects— are problematic for night-time driving. There is little evidence to support this claim, however.Indeed, if anything, most contact lenses should aid in your night-driving ability by improving your vision. There is a caveat for multifocal lenses, however, which is discussed below., Some research has indicated that multifocal contacts — basically bifocals on your eyes — may make it more difficult to discern colors and sharp details in low light. This claim is still debated by experts, however.Some experts recommend wearing night-driving glasses along with your multifocal contacts to improve visual acuity,while others believe them to be useless in this role.If you wear multifocal contacts, talk to your prescribing eye doctor, especially if you feel you have any problems with night vision.
The best solution may be to simply switch to equivalent anti-glare eyeglasses for night driving. There is no evidence that these hinder low light vision., The best way to ensure that you see your best when driving is to have regular eye appointments.


Your eye doctor will discuss the right frequency of appointments for you, such as annually or bi-annually.
Some contact wearers notice blurry vision at night and blame so-called “night myopia,” but this is not a legitimate medical condition. It is simply more difficult to see at night because of lower light levels. If your vision is noticeably blurry at night, you most likely should have your vision checked and prescription adjusted., Some people blame their eyes for night-time driving difficulties when the culprit may be something as simple as a dirty windshield.Streaked, smudged, and dirty windshields can cause blurring, clouding, distortions, and glare, so keep yours clean.
Dim or cloudy headlights can also limit night vision, so replace dimmed bulbs and clean the outside and inside of the headlamp covers to reduce clouding.
If the problem with blurred vision is with your eyes but not your contacts, you may possibly have cataracts. These cannot be cured with eyewear, so consult with an eye care professional for options.
A common symptom of early cataracts is increased glare from headlights while driving at night."

Avoid rubbing your eyes.,
Take them out if they are causing you abnormal discomfort or other problems.",How to Deal With Hard Contacts," Before inserting your contacts, you need to wash your hands thoroughly. This is important, as dirty hands can transmit bacteria or other contaminants into your eyes, leading to conjunctivitis and other problems. Make sure to:


Use warm water and soap.
Lather for at least 20 seconds.
Consider using antibacterial soap.;
, When taking your contacts out of the container, you should be very careful. This is because your contacts are fragile and can be damaged easily. Damaging your contacts may result in decreased clarity and might even wind up hurting your eyes.


Move in a slow and deliberate manner.
Make sure you take your contacts out in a safe and stationary environment. It is never a good idea to work with your contacts on a bus or in a public location.
Rinse contacts with solution right before putting them into your eyes, especially if have to be in a location in which there might be dust or other debris in the air., After washing your hands and removing your contacts from their container, it will be time to place them in your eyes. You should do this in a slow and unhurried manner.


Pull the bottom of your eyes down with your middle finger, or another finger.
Tap a contact into your eye.
Blink several times to make sure your contact settles onto your eye properly., Make sure to remove your contacts every night before you go to bed. Removing them ensures that they don’t damage your eyes while you sleep and that they’ll be able to soak in cleansing and lubricating formula overnight.


Take your contacts out before bedtime.
Drop them in cleansing and lubricating solution.
Change your storing or cleaning solution every day.
Do not wear your contacts for days or weeks at a time. This will damage your eyes., By placing your contacts on hard surfaces, you may expose them to things that could scratch or damage them. This is because your contacts are fragile and can be damaged relatively easily.


You should only place or store your contacts in containers specifically designed to hold them.
Don’t put your contacts on a table.
If you drop your contacts, make sure not to drag them as you’re picking them up – they may scratch.
If you don’t have access to contact storage containers, consider temporarily storing them in a plastic zip lock bag. If you can, put some solution in the bag to minimize the chances of them getting scratched., Make sure to store your hard contacts in proper storage devices. If you don’t store your lenses properly, you may damage them or introduce bacteria or debris into your eye.


Purchase contact lens storage containers that have ridges on the bottom – this will prevent your contacts from suctioning to the flat bottom of containers.
Consider buying new storage containers every several months or less. This is because storage containers accumulate germs, bacteria, and debris.
If you don’t buy new containers, clean your old ones with antibacterial soap and then rinse them to remove all soap or residue., Another important thing to consider when wearing and caring for your contacts is making sure you give yourself enough time to get used to them. This is because hard contacts are more rigid than soft contacts, and as a result will feel more uncomfortable until your eyes get used to them.


Realize that it is normal to feel a level of discomfort when first wearing hard contacts.
It may take up to a few weeks to get used to wearing hard contacts.
Wear your contacts on a daily basis, otherwise they won’t be comfortable.
It may be helpful to build up your wear time. Start with an hour a day and increase it by an hour or two each day.
If you decide to wear glasses for a few days, your eyes will quickly lose acclimation to your hard contacts.
Consult your optometrist if you have any concerns about discomfort you may feel when wearing hard contacts., There are a variety of activities in which you should not use your contacts. These activities can indirectly result in eye infections, irritation, and potentially sight-threatening conditions. Some activities include:


Showering. This is because shampoo, soap, and other materials may be introduced into your eye.
Swimming.
Any activity in which bacteria, chemicals, or debris can be introduced into your eye., If something gets into your eyes, don’t rub them. Rubbing will make the problem worse. It may irritate your eyes or damage the contacts.


Rubbing eyes with contacts in them may cause corneal abrasions.
Blink until the debris moves out of your eye.
Consider using eye drops or eye lubricant.
Consult your optometrist., Discontinue use of your contacts if they’re causing you any problems at all. Depending on the problem, you’ll need to consider different solutions.


If your contacts are making your eyes red, you may need to soak them in solution for a while. You may also need lubrication solution for your eyes.
If your contacts are scratching your eyes or causing burning sensations, take them out immediately.
If you have any concerns, contact your optometrist as soon as possible.

Replace your lenses and lens case on schedule.",How to Determine if You Are Overwearing Your Contact Lenses," Your contact lenses may have a recommended wear duration, depending on the type of contacts you purchased. If you're unsure about your contacts, check the packaging or call your eye doctor to inquire about how long you can continuously wear your lenses. Most contact lenses fall into one of the following categories:Daily wear — These lenses are often the least expensive, and therefore may be one of the most prevalent types of lenses. Daily wear lenses must be removed each night to be cleaned and disinfected.
Extended wear — These lenses can be left in while you sleep and for several days in a row, but must be removed at least once every week for cleaning and disinfecting. Even with extended wear lenses, though, there is still a risk of eye infections if left in overnight or for too many days in a row. Thus, it is best to take your contacts out every night.
Disposable lenses — This type of lens does not need to be cleaned/disinfected, but must be thrown away after the prescribed length of time has passed. Depending on the type of disposable lens you purchase, your lenses may need to be removed and replaced every day, every week, or every month.;
, One easy way to determine if you've been overwearing your contact lenses is to assess whether you've kept them in overnight. Some contact lenses are made for round-the-clock continuous use, but many need to be removed and soaked overnight.Only wear your contact lenses overnight if your eye doctor has told you it is safe to do so.
If you can't remember whether it's safe to leave your contacts in overnight, call or visit your eye doctor to ask for clarification.
If your eye doctor has advised against leaving your contacts in overnight, you need to take your contacts out every night before bed. If you've been leaving them in, there's a good chance you've been overwearing them.

, One of the most common results of overwearing contact lenses is eye irritation. This can develop suddenly or over time. Eye irritation is not usually a medically serious problem if you remove your contacts and care for your eyes right away, though it may indicate a more serious ailment. You may want to see your doctor if you experience any of the following:


Pain/discomfort in the eyes, which may include itchy, burning, or a gritty sensation
Excessive tearing or production and discharge of other fluids
Abnormal sensitivity to light
Excessive redness
Swelling
Blurred or unclear vision

, Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is a type of allergy-related eye infection. Though it has ""conjunctivitis"" in the name, it is not related to pink eye, and therefore is not contagious/infectious.GPC is caused by either an allergic reaction to the lens cleaner you use, the actual lens itself, the friction of a contact lens rubbing against your eyelid, or a buildup of debris on your contacts. It can occur with both soft and rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses, although some studies suggest that you are more likely to contract GPC from wearing soft lenses.You should see your eye doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:


Itching
Burning
Redness
Blurred vision
Swollen/droopy eyelids
An increase in mucus draining from your eye
The sensation that there is a foreign piece of debris in your eye

, If you've experienced any pain or discomfort, or if you've identified any of the above symptoms, you should take your contact lenses out immediately. Check the packaging to determine if you need to discard the lenses or simply take them out for cleaning/disinfecting. No matter what you decide to do with the lenses, it's a good idea to let your eyes rest without contacts for at least a few hours. Try wearing glasses or simply taking your lenses out at night before you sleep, and take care of your eyes if they're uncomfortable.Use a re-wetting solution or saline eye drops to lubricate your eyes. This can reduce redness and discomfort.
Wash your hands with soap and water before handling contact lenses. Dry your hands with a disposable paper towel.
Use a finger from your non-dominant hand to hold your upper eyelid open. Use the middle finger of your dominant hand to hold down your lower eyelid.
Using the index finger of your dominant hand, slide the contact off the center of your eye and outward or downward onto the white of your eye.
Once the contact is off the center of your eye, carefully use your index finger and thumb to pinch the contact lens and pull it off of your eye.Be sure to put the contact lenses into a proper storage container filled with clean saline solution immediately after removing them from your eyes.
Avoid wearing contacts again until you've spoken with your eye doctor about the irritation you experienced. It may have been a simply aggravation, but it could be a sign of more serious problems., Even if your lenses are made to wear continuously, they can still cause discomfort to your eyes over time. Experts generally recommend that you avoid pushing the limits of what your contact lenses have been tested and approved for, as prolonged wear has been linked to discomfort and more serious vision problems.If you wear contact lenses, you may want to try limiting your extended use, if at all possible.


Take your contact lenses out to sleep. This is the easiest way to reduce your use of contact lenses, and many eye professionals recommend it.
Switch to glasses when you get home from work/school. Contacts are convenient for when you can't or don't want to wear glasses, but if you're just relaxing at home you may want to give your eyes a break.

, The frequency with which you'll need to replace your contact lenses will depend entirely upon the type of contact lenses you wear. You may be able to find this information on the packaging of your contact lenses; if you cannot find this information on your contact lens packaging, call your eye doctor to find out how frequently you should be replacing your lenses.Daily disposable lenses typically need to be replaced every day.
Two week disposable lenses should be replaced once every two weeks.
Monthly disposable lenses should be replaced once every month.

, Once you know how often you should be replacing your lenses, you'll need to determine how long you've actually been using them. It's okay if you don't remember the exact date, but you should be able to identify approximately how long you've been using that pair of lenses. Going forward, you should take measures to keep track of the date you started using the lenses and how long they're meant to be worn.


It may be helpful to mark the start date on a calendar or on the contact lens packaging.
Try setting a daily, weekly, or monthly alert for yourself on your cellphone so that you remember to replace your lenses. You can set this alert to repeat on a regular basis so that you never forget to replace your contact lenses when you're supposed to.

, If you're unsure about how long you've had your current contact lenses, it may be best to be proactive and cautious. Discard any lens that you think is overused, especially if you've experienced any pain or discomfort. Immediately discard any lens that has become ripped or torn, as this can scratch your cornea or cause other types of damage to your eye.It's better to have to pay for an extra pair of contact lenses than to risk damaging your eyes and altering your vision.
Once you replace your lenses, begin keeping track of the date you open a new pair. Be aware of how long your type of contact lenses are meant to be worn, and don't overwear them going forward.

, There are many possible reasons why your eyes could become irritated while wearing contact lenses. Your eyes may not be getting enough air, you could be suffering from allergies/infection, or there could be some dirt/debris built up on your lens. The lens could also be torn, past its intended use date, or it could simply be the wrong shape for your eye. If your eyes become irritated from wearing contact lenses, whether you've overworn them or not, it's best to take them out and see an eye doctor before wearing lenses again.Take your contact lenses out immediately and put them in your lens case with fresh contact solution. If you think the lenses might be past their intended use date or have a tear, throw them out right away.
Use a re-wetting solution or saline eyedrops to lubricate your eyes. This should relieve some of the discomfort if your eyes are dry.
Wear your eyeglasses instead of contacts for a while. It's best to avoid wearing contact lenses again until you've seen your eye doctor.
Make an eye appointment and have your eyes evaluated for more serious medical conditions.
See a doctor immediately if you experience pain, signs of infection, flashes of light, persistently blurred vision, or sudden loss of vision.

, Having dirty hands or handling your contact lenses wrong can lead to those lenses causing you pain and discomfort. Your eye doctor should inform you of how to handle your contact lenses, and you should follow those instructions carefully.Wash your hands with soap and clean water before you handle your contact lenses or touch your eye at all.
Dry your hands with a clean, disposable paper towel.
Make sure you do not use any hand lotion, perfume, or scented oils before handling your contact lenses.
If you wear hair spray, make sure you apply it to your hair before you insert your contact lenses. Spraying hair products with your contacts in could trap airborne particles against your eye.
Apply makeup after putting in your contact lenses to avoid accidentally touching your lenses with makeup on your hands.
Make sure your fingernails are trimmed short and filed smooth before handling your contacts. A sharp or jagged fingernail could tear a lens or scratch your eye.

, It's important to clean and disinfect your lenses every day, even if you have extended wear lenses. Always use fresh contact solution, and don't use any other liquid to clean your contacts.Avoid using water or saliva to clean your lenses. Your saliva harbors a staggering amount of bacteria, and water (even tap water) can contain microorganisms that are safe to drink but could cause serious damage to your eyes.
Never reuse contact lens solution. Always pour out a fresh pool of solution every time you store your lenses.
Clean your lens case. Empty out any old solution, wash the case with warm water, rinse it with contact solution, and let it air dry.
To clean your lenses, you can squirt a little solution into the palm of your hand and carefully use the index finger of your other hand to swirl the lens around in the solution.

, Talk to your eye doctor to ensure that you're replacing your contact lenses as often as you should be. In addition to replacing your contact lenses on a regular basis, you may not realize that you should also replace your contact lens case regularly. Most experts recommend replacing your case every three to six months, as dirt and bacteria can build up in spite of regular cleanings.Keep track of when you should replace both your lenses and your case.
Ask your eye doctor for a chart showing how often you should replace your case.
You can also simply mark it on your calendar, write the date you started the lenses on their packaging, or set a reminder alert in your cellphone.

Wash your hands.,
Empty your case.,
Never “top-off” the solution.",How to Clean a Contact Lens Case1," Before you touch your contacts or any part of your case you need to wash your hands with warm water and soap. Hold your hands under the water and sing the “Birthday Song” to ensure that they are properly clean. Being vigilant about handwashing will prevent the transfer of bacteria from your hands to your eyes.For best results, use an all-natural soap that does not contain additional fragrances or moisturizers. These chemicals can transfer from your hands to the case and then to your eyes.When you know you are going to handle your case or contacts, dry your hands off with a lint-free towel. This will prevent fibers from making their way into your case and causing eye irritation.;
, Grab your case and unscrew the lids from the wells (if they are closed). Set the lids aside. Turn the case upside down over your sink and drain out the old solution. Shake the case a bit to remove any leftover moisture.


This may sound like common sense, but check that you contacts are not in the case before you empty it.

, If you see leftover lens solution in your case, resist the urge to add solution to it and move on. Reusing solution in this way lessens its sanitizing effects and can lead to a bacterial infection."

Store your case in an appropriate area.",How to Clean a Contact Lens Case2," Using a clean, lint-free rag or a washed finger, gently rub inside the case wells to dislodge any biofilm that may be stuck to the plastic. To achieve maximum cleanliness, try to cover all interior surfaces of the case and spend at least five seconds rubbing each area., Get out your bottle of multi-purpose contact solution and gently spray into the open case. Continue until you are satisfied that any debris have been removed. Don’t forget to spray solution onto the underside of the lids as well.


Spraying is a critical step in bacteria prevention. One study reported that 70% of contact cases contained bacteria and other contaminants.Make sure to use the multi-purpose solution that your doctor suggested. Using a standard saline solution or wetting solution will not sanitize your case properly., As a general rule, you want to keep your contacts and your contact case away from all types of water. Do not rinse your case out with water. Doing so could potentially expose you to Acanthamoeba keratitis, an eye infection that can lead to blindness., After you’ve completed the rinsing process, set out a clean tissue or a clean lint-free cloth. Place the case and lid caps on the tissue. Place them either facing up or down, depending on your preference. Some argue that face down is better as it protects the case from airborne contaminants, like those commonly found in a bathroom., When your case is completely dry, you can then refill it with fresh contact solution. It is ready to store your contacts at this point.

, Consider carefully where you place your contact case during all phases of use. Cases are more likely to be exposed to bacteria in humid environments. Leaving your case in a bathroom, and near a toilet in particular, may cause it to come into contact with contaminated water droplets. You may want to consider a nightstand as an alternative storage option."
"
Throw away your case if it is damaged.,
Clean your case weekly.,
Replace your case every three months.,
Purchase a bacteria-resistant case.",How to Clean a Contact Lens Case3," Each day take a quick look at your case to see if it has developed any cracks. Even a crack in the lid threading can let bacteria into the interior well area. Or, if you drop your case and it sustains damage, you may want to consider replacing it early., Take out a fresh, clean toothbrush used expressly for this purpose. Get out your bottle of contact solution as well. Wet the toothbrush with the solution and scrub out the interior and lids of your case. When you are done, rinse it out with solution and let your case air dry.Some people contend that boiling your case is the best weekly cleaning method. If you would like to try this, you will need to dip your case into boiling water for at least three minutes. Be very careful to avoid burns.Other people recommend that you run your case through the dishwasher.If you detect visible dirt or hard biofilm on your case during your weekly cleaning, you may want to consider replacing it early., When you get a new case, turn it over and write the date on the bottom with a sharpie. This way you’ll know when you need to replace it. Bacteria begins to accumulate in a case after just one week of use, so three months of usage is really the limit. Don’t wait until your doctor gives you a replacement. You can purchase a new case at the pharmacy or grocery store.In one study, 47% of contacts users admitted to never replacing their lens case.You may be tempted to keep using your case if it doesn’t look dirty or worn. However, be aware that most bacteria are not able to be seen by the naked eye., Researchers have been developing a contact lens case that repels bacteria. The case is currently being tested and could be on the market shortly."

Wash your hands.,
Stay calm.,
Locate the lens.,
Moisten the lens.,
Massage your eyelid.,
Change your approach.,
Lift your eyelid.,
See your eye doctor.",How to Remove Stuck Contact Lenses1," Your hands should always be clean whenever inserting or removing your contact lenses.Your hands carry around thousands of bacteria, including fecal bacteria, just from the things you touch every day. Wash your hands with soap and warm water before touching your eyes to prevent infection.For stuck lenses, washing your hands is even more important, because you'll likely be touching your eye area for a longer period of time. The more time your fingers spend in contact with your eyes, the more likely you are to spread contamination.
Do not dry the palm or fingertips of the hand that is going to touch your eye. Otherwise, you might get towel fibers or lint in your eye.;
, Panicking or getting overly anxious about the situation will just make it more difficult to remove the lenses. If you feel anxious, take a few deep breaths before you continue.Don’t worry! Your contact lens cannot get stuck behind your eyeball. The conjunctiva, a mucous membrane in front of your eye, and muscles around your eye called the rectus muscles make this impossible.Getting a soft contact lens stuck in your eye is not a serious health risk, unless you leave it for a long period of time. While it may be irritating, it is unlikely to damage your eye.However, a rigid lens can cause a cornea abrasion if it is broken and that can lead to an infection.
If you've made several unsuccessful attempts to remove the lens, take a break from trying for a bit. Sit down for a while and relax.

, In many cases, contact lenses get stuck because they have slid out of their proper place over the cornea. If this is the case for you, you'll need to find the lens before you can remove it. Close your eyes and relax your eyelids. You should be able to feel where the lens has gone. If you can't feel it under your eyelid, gently touch the lid with your fingers and see if you can locate it.If the lens has moved to the corner of your eye, you may be able find it just by looking in the mirror.Try looking in the opposite direction of the lens. For example, if the lens feels like it's in the right corner of your eye, look left. Or, if the lens feels like it’s stuck in the bottom part of your eye, look up. The lens may become visible. If you can't feel or see the lens, it is possible it has fallen out of your eye.Put your finger at the top of your eyelid (near your eyebrow) and pull up to hold your eyelid open. This may help you see the contact lens better. Keep in mind that if you look down with your eyes while pulling up on the eyelid, it paralyzes the orbicularis oculi muscle and you can't squeeze it shut until you look up again.

, Lenses can get stuck because they have dried out. Moisten the lens with saline solution. Apply the saline solution directly to the lens, if possible. Wait for a few minutes to allow the lens to hydrate and soften.If the lens is stuck under your eyelid or in the corner of your eye, the added moisture may help it float back into its proper place, where it will be easier to remove.Often, moistening the lens will allow you to remove it through conventional methods. Blink several times or close your eyes for a few seconds, then try to remove the lens again., If the lens remains stuck or trapped under the eyelid, close your eyes and gently massage the lids with your fingertips.If the lens is still out of place, try to push it over the cornea.
If your lens is stuck under your eyelid, it may help to look down while massaging the eyelid., If the lens is in its proper place but still won't come out, try using a different method of removing your contact lens. Most people pinch their lenses out, but you can also try removing them by placing a finger on each eyelid and applying gentle pressure as you blink.You can use either the index finger or the middle finger of each hand. With the finger on your upper lid, press straight down. With the finger on your lower lid, press straight up.
The lens should pull away from the eye and be easy to remove.

, If the lens is still stuck and you think it may be lodged under your eyelid, try gently lifting the lid away from your eye and turning it inside out.To do this, use a cotton tip and press down on the middle of the eyelid while pulling the eyelashes forward away from the eye.
Tip your head backward. You should be able to see the contact lens if it is stuck under the lid. Carefully pull it out from underneath your eyelid.
You may need the help of a friend or family member to do this., If all else fails, or if your eye becomes extremely red or irritated, go to your local doctor, optometrist, or hospital. They can remove the lens without causing further damage to your eye.If you believe you have scratched or otherwise damaged your eye in attempting to remove the lens, contact your eye doctor immediately. You should see a doctor about possible damage whether you have successfully removed the lens or not."

Use a suction cup.,
Get to a doctor if necessary.",How to Remove Stuck Contact Lenses2," Thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water. Don't dry the fingers that are touching the eye to avoid getting lint in the eye. Your hands should always be clean whenever inserting or removing your contact lenses.Thorough washing is especially important if you are touching your eye for a longer period of time, such as when trying to remove a stuck lens.

, A stuck lens is not an emergency, and anxiety will only make it harder to locate and remove the lens.Your contact lens cannot get stuck behind your eyeball. The conjunctiva, a mucous membrane in front of your eye, and muscles around your eye called the rectus muscles make this impossible.Getting a contact lens stuck in your eye is not a serious health risk, unless you leave it for a long period of time. While it may be irritating, it is unlikely to damage your eye. If the contact lens is broken it may be painful., In most cases, rigid contact lenses get stuck because they have slid out of their proper place over the cornea. If this is the case, you'll need to determine where in your eye the lens has moved before you can remove it.


Close your eyes and relax your eyelids. You should be able to feel the lens in your eye. If you can't feel it under your eyelid, gently touch the lid with your fingers and see if you can locate it.If the lens has moved to the corner of your eye, you may be able locate it just by looking in the mirror.Try looking in the opposite direction of the lens. For example, if the lens feels like it's in the right corner of your eye, look left. Or, if the lens feels like it’s stuck in the bottom part of your eye, look up. The lens may become visible.If you can't see or feel where the lens has gone, it is possible it has fallen out of your eye., If the lens has moved to the white of your eye, you can often dislodge it by breaking the suction between the lens and eyeball. To do this, use your fingertip to gently press your eye just outside the edge of the lens.Do not massage the eyeball as you would with soft lenses. This may cause the edge of the lens to scratch the surface of your eye as it moves., If the lens remains stuck, you can purchase a small suction cup tool in the eye-care section of many drug stores which will allow you to remove the lens.Ideally, your optometrist will have taught you this technique before prescribing the lens.


First, wash the suction cup with contact lens cleaner. Moisten the suction cup with saline solution.Use your thumb and forefinger to separate your eyelids.
Apply the suction cup to the center of the lens and pull it out, being careful not to touch your eye with the suction cup.
The lens can be removed from the suction cup by sliding it gently sideways.Consider seeing a medical professional before choosing this method. Using a suction cup device to remove rigid lenses on your own can cause trauma to your eye., If you cannot remove the lens, go to your local doctor, optometrist, or hospital to have them remove the lens for you. You should also seek medical assistance if your eye becomes very red or irritated.If you believe you have scratched or otherwise damaged your eye in attempting to remove the lens, contact your eye doctor immediately. You should seek medical assistance whether you have successfully removed the lens or not."

Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before ever touching your eyes.If you touch your eyes with dirty fingers and hands, you could cause eye infections or scratches.

, Use contact lens eye drops or lubricating drops to keep your eyes moist throughout the day. This will help keep your lenses from getting stuck.If you develop itchiness or redness after using drops, try to find a product marked “preservative-free.”

, Clean your lens case every day. After you’ve put in your contacts, wash the case with sterile solution or hot (preferably distilled) water. and soap. Do not leave the case full of tap water. That causes fungal and bacterial infections. Allow the case to air dry.Replace your lens case every three months. Even with daily cleaning, bacteria and other nasty stuff will eventually get into your case.

, After you’ve cleaned your case and let it air dry, put fresh, clean contact solution into the case. The solution loses its potency after awhile, so keeping it fresh every day will help your lenses stay disinfected and clean., Different types of lenses require different care products. Use the correct type of solution for your type of lenses. Follow your eye care professional’s recommendations for cleaning and sanitizing your lenses.Use only commercially prepared solutions, eye drops, and cleaners to reduce your risk of infection.

, Your eye care professional should give you a range of how long it is safe to wear your lenses each day. Use your lenses in accordance with these professional recommendations.


Do not sleep with lenses in unless you’ve been prescribed “extended wear” contact lenses. Even then, professionals don’t recommend sleeping in these lenses, as it can increase your risk of eye infections., If you’re going swimming, taking a bath or shower, or getting in the hot tub, take your lenses out first. This will help minimize your risk of infection., Your contacts can get stuck to your eyes when the lenses dry out. One way to help avoid this is to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking enough fluids will help your eyes stay moist.


The recommended daily intake for men is at least 13 cups (3 liters) a day. The recommended intake for women is at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day.If you routinely have dry eyes, try to stay away from alcohol and excessive caffeine when possible. These substances dehydrate your body. Water is best for you, but other good options include fruit juices, milk, and unsweetened, non-caffeinated teas like Rooibos and many herbal teas.

, Studies have shown that smoking makes dry eyes worse. “Dry eye” can result in your contact lenses getting stuck.Smokers who wear contact lenses have more problems with their lenses than non-smokers.


Even passive (second-hand) exposure to cigarette smoke can cause issues for contact-lens wearers., You can help prevent eye issues by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and reducing eye strain.Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, collards, kale, and other greens are excellent for eye health. Salmon, tuna, and other fatty fish contain omega-3 fatty acids that can help prevent some eye issues.
Studies have shown that people who exercise regularly have better eye health overall. They are also less likely to develop serious eye diseases such as glaucoma.If you don’t get enough sleep, it can have effects on your eyesight. The most common side effect is dry eyes. You might also experience eye twitches or spasms.Try to reduce eye strain when you can. You can do this by reducing glare from your electronics, setting up an ergonomically correct workstation, and taking frequent breaks from working that involves your eyes.

, Seeing an eye care professional regularly can help keep you from developing issues. Regular professional exams can also detect eye diseases such as glaucoma.If you have existing eye issues or you are in your late 30s, you should see an eye doctor yearly.

Seek medical help if you experience problems.",How to Choose Contact Lenses," There are many different types of soft lenses to meet your needs. Generally speaking, a soft lens is easier to adjust to than a rigid gas permeable lens. Soft lenses also tend to be more comfortable, especially when worn for prolonged periods of time.Extended wear lenses — Can be worn overnight and left in continuously for up to seven days without removing them.In addition, Air Optix Night and Days are FDA approved for up to 30 days overnight wear.Planned replacement lenses — Should not be worn overnight. Must be replaced regularly, usually every two weeks, four weeks, or 12 weeks.
Silicone-based lenses — These lenses are highly breathable and prevent deposits from accumulating. This can result in a more comfortable lens with less risk of irritation, especially if you suffer from dry eyes.Colored soft lenses — These soft lenses are colored with a tint. The tint may be functional (making it easier to find a lost lens) without altering the color of your eye, or it may be cosmetic, giving you a different eye color than your natural color.;
, Though soft lenses are generally preferable for extended wear, they do not have the longevity that a rigid gas permeable lens has; however, there are some options as far as how long you can reuse a lens before it needs to be replaced.Daily disposable lenses — These lenses will cost more money due to the frequency at which they are disposed of; however, changing your lenses on a daily basis carries the lowest risk of infection. These lenses are a good choice for people with dry eyes or are prone to allergies as deposits and allergens have less time to build up because you have a new lens each day.
Two week/monthly disposable lenses — These are slightly less expensive than daily disposables, and still help reduce the risk of infection by using new lenses every few weeks. Some disposable soft lenses can even be replaced every three months, though you should always defer to your optometrist's advice., Many people choose contact lenses because contacts can be worn during sports without the risk of damage that eyeglasses carry. If you engage in outdoor sports, or if you generally spend a lot of time in the sun, you may want to consider talking to your optometrist about soft lenses with UV protection.It's important to note that not all soft lenses provide UV protection, though many do. Talk to your optometrist about your options if UV protection is a factor in your decision.
Full eye protection is important and UV protection in contacts only protects part of the eye. The rest of the eye should be protected too, so you should still wear sunglasses outdoors even if your contacts provide UV protection.

, For many people, soft lenses are more comfortable than rigid gas permeable lenses and better meet their needs; however, soft lenses usually don't correct vision as well as rigid lenses.There are some other disadvantages that are worth considering.Soft lenses tend to absorb environmental pollutants more easily than rigid lenses. If you are around smoke or airborne particles on a regular basis, you may want to talk to your optometrist to determine if soft lenses would pose a problem.
In addition to environmental pollutants, soft lenses also tend to soak up irritants from your hands, including lotion and hand soap. Washing your hands before handling lenses can reduce this risk, though it will not eliminate the chances of absorption.
Because of their soft, porous nature, these contact lenses are much more fragile than rigid lenses. As a result, they may rip or tear more easily (though they are meant to be replaced more frequently).

, RGP lenses tend to be slightly less popular than soft lenses for a number of reasons, but there are many areas in which RGP lenses excel. An RGP lens will have the following benefits for most contact lens users:Sharper vision than soft lenses provide
Better visual clarity for some users with astigmatism
Preferable for some users with presbyopia who require bifocals or multifocals
Better fit and clarity for users with Keratoconus (cone-shaped cornea)
Preferable for individuals who need contact lenses after refractive surgery
Can be used for ortho-k procedures, in which lenses are worn at night to reshape the cornea

, Though RGP lenses are preferable for some users with specific needs, there are also some down sides to these lenses. Some users report that RGP lenses may have the following disadvantages:They take longer to get used to and may be less comfortable.
They will need to be worn regularly to become comfortable for the user (they can even become uncomfortable after a week of not wearing lenses).
There is a greater risk of RGP lenses becoming dislodged during physical activities due to the smaller size of the lenses.
There is a higher risk of discomfort or corneal abrasions due to the increased chance of dust/debris getting lodged under the lenses.
They require greater care and maintenance than soft lenses; however, they tend to last longer, which may save you money in the long run.

, If you're on the fence about soft vs. RGP lenses, you may want to consider trying hybrid contact lenses. Hybrid lenses are made with a rigid, gas-permeable center but have a soft ring around the RGP component. This gives you the comfort of a soft lens while meeting the specialized needs some users have for a rigid lens.Hybrid lenses can be used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, age-related loss of close-up vision, and keratoconus.
Many users who need rigid lenses find that hybrid contact lenses are much more comfortable and easier to wear.

, Before you choose a contact lens, or any type of eyewear, it's important to have a thorough examination and fitting with an eye care specialist. An eye exam is required to determine your lens strength and to acquire a prescription for contact lenses. A fitting is necessary to ensure that your lenses fit the shape of your eye and can comfortably meet your needs.You will most likely need one or more follow-up exams after receiving your lenses. These are typically scheduled one week after getting your lenses, then either one month or six months after, then on an annual basis.

, If you're planning on wearing your contact lenses every day, then you have some flexibility in choosing soft or rigid lenses; however, if you only plan on wearing your contacts on weekends or special occasions, you may be better off choosing soft lenses.While soft lenses can be worn comfortably on a part-time or full-time basis, rigid lenses must be worn full time in order to remain comfortable on your eyes.

, Any contact lens will correct your vision, giving you better clarity than no lens at all; however, rigid lenses are generally considered to provide the sharpest possible vision of any type of contact lens, especially for users who have astigmatism.If you need sharp, near-perfect vision for work, consider talking to an eye care specialist about whether a rigid lens might work best for you.

, Improper lens care can lead to a whole host of vision problems, including fungal infections, bacterial infections, and corneal ulcers. Daily cleaning is required by both soft lenses and rigid lenses. The exception is daily disposable contacts, which are thrown out at the end of the day.Because soft lenses are typically replaced on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, there is less risk of irritations or infections caused by build up on the lens.
If you don't mind taking the extra care and maintenance to keep your contacts in good condition, rigid lenses may work fine for you; however, if you are worried about your ability to take care of your lenses (including the risk of losing lenses), you may want to consider a soft lens.

, It may go without saying, but you'll need to clean and care for your lenses no matter which type you choose. This is important, as cleaning and disinfecting your lenses will help remove dirt and irritants, including bacteria and fungi that could otherwise infect your eye.Clean and disinfect your lenses every time you remove them by rinsing and storing your lenses in an approved contact lens solution.
To rinse the lens, pour some clean contact solution in the palm of your hand. Use your index finger to gently rub the contact lens around in the solution in your palm.
Never reuse contact lens solution. Clean out your lens case on a daily basis and always use fresh contact solution whenever you take out your lenses.
Do not use homemade cleaning solutions. You should also avoid using saliva to wet or clean your lenses before use, as this will introduce bacteria to your eyes.
Do not use tap water to wash your lenses. Microorganisms can live in distilled water (including the water that comes out of your faucet), and while that water is safe to drink it could be dangerous to trap that water against your eye with a contact lens., Proper care and maintenance of your contact lens case is just as important as cleaning your contacts themselves. Dirt, bacteria, and fungus can accumulate in your case, so you'll need to learn how to clean your case and how often to replace it.Clean your lens case every day. Avoid using soap; simply rinse it with hot water and spray it down with contact lens solution.
Always allow your lens case to air dry. Leaving your lens case wet all day and every day can promote fungal growth, which can cause infections and damage to your eyes.
Replace your contact lens case every three months., Though contact lenses are safe to wear, their continued safety depends on how you wear and store your lenses. Anything you introduce your contacts to will eventually make its way to your eyes, which can cause irritation, pain, or even infections.Always wash your hands with a mild, unscented, non-cosmetic soap before handling your contact lenses.
Dry your hands with a clean, lint-free towel before handling your lenses.
Keep your fingernails short and smooth to reduce the risk of damaging the lenses or scratching your eye.
If you wear hair spray, make sure you apply it before putting in your contacts. Be sure to wash your hands after using/handling hair spray to prevent it from getting onto your lenses.
If you wear makeup, put your contacts in before applying cosmetics. Likewise, make sure you remove your contact lenses before cleaning off your makeup at the end of the day.
Only wear your contact lenses for the length of time and the long-term duration that your eye care professional recommended.Do not sleep with your lenses unless your eye care professional has told you it is safe to do so. Never wear your contacts while swimming in any body of water, including swimming pools., Contact lenses do not usually pose any problems for most users, other than some discomfort while adjusting to wearing a lens; however, some people experience adverse symptoms, usually associated with an infection or an underlying medical problem. See your eye doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:

Other symptoms may not be felt, but rather seen in a mirror or by others around you. Some of the most common symptoms pf contact discomfort include:Stinging, burning, or itching in the eye
Gradual reduction in comfort the longer the lens is in
The sensation of something foreign in your eye
Excessive tear production
Unusual fluid secretions
Reduced vision or blurry vision
Rainbows/halos/orbs around objects in your field of vision

, Allergies are a common cause of eye irritation, especially for contact lens wearers. Airborne allergens can easily latch on to your lenses, and if you don't remove, clean, and replace your lenses as often as you should, exposure to those allergens could cause eye irritation.If you know you experience seasonal allergies, pet allergies, or other common environmental allergies, try taking allergy medication on a daily basis.
You can buy over-the-counter eye drops that contain antihistamines. These can help reduce swelling, inflammation, and irritation in your eyes.
Always follow the directions on your contact lens packaging or from your eye doctor on how often you should remove or replace your lenses.

, Wearing contact lenses for longer than the recommended time span can cause deposits to form on the surface of the contacts, which can cause mild to severe irritation.Always check the recommended wear times on your contact lenses to avoid this simple problem.


Everyone has a different level of comfort regarding how long is too long to continuously wear contacts.
Every brand that manufactures contact lenses has their own guidelines for how long to wear contacts before removing or replacing them. These guidelines are approved by the FDA and should appear on the packaging., Wearing lenses that are past the recommended replacement date can lead to the same protein and mineral buildups that result from not taking out your lenses. Reusing old lenses can also increase the risk of lens tears, which can irritate or injure your eyes.


Always follow the recommended replacement schedule indicated on your contact lens packaging.
As a general rule, two-week silicone hydrogel lenses should be replaced every two weeks, one-month silicone hydrogel lenses should be replaced every four weeks, and daily disposable lenses should be replaced every day., If you're new to wearing contact lenses, your eyes will need time to adjust to having them in. Trying to wear contacts all day with no previous experience can cause irritation, pain, and discomfort.Limit yourself to four hours or less of wear time during the first two days.
You can increase your wear time to eight hours on days three and four.
On days five and six, limit your wear time to six hours.
On the seventh and eighth days, increase your wear time to 10 hours.
Only wear contacts for 12 consecutive hours after approximately nine to 10 days of wearing lenses.

, This is often an issue with people new to wearing contact lenses — they may be unable to identify when their contact lens is inside out and put them in the wrong way, causing discomfort. A simple way to check is to place your contact on the tip of a (clean) finger and observe its shape. Hold the contact up to your eye to get a close look — does it look like half of a ball or more like a soup bowl, with edges that flare out? If the contact looks like a sphere sliced in half, then it is correct and you can put it in your eye. If the sides are flared, then it is inside out., Most eye irritation/discomfort is caused by environmental factors, like allergens and debris, or by improper use of contact lenses; however, sometimes eye discomfort is caused by a more serious problem. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:Severe eye pain
Swelling
Persistent redness or irritation
Signs of infection
Flashes of light
Persistent blurred vision
Sudden loss of vision
Goopy discharge

Clean out your storage case.",How to Deal With Uncomfortable Contact Lenses2," You should always wash your hands thoroughly before handling your contact lenses or touching your eyes. This is to prevent dirt and germs from entering your eye, which may cause irritation or infection.Use clean, running water to wet your hands.
Apply soap and lather between your hands. Make sure you cover the fronts and backs of your hands, between the fingers, and underneath your fingernails.
Scrub your hands together for at least 20 seconds to ensure you've covered every part of your hands and allowed enough time for the soap to clean your skin.
Rinse away all the soap under clean, running water.Use a clean, lint-free towel to dry your hands.
Make sure your fingernails are trimmed short and kept smooth so you do not accidentally scratch your eye.

, Gently pinch each lens individually and remove it very carefully from your eye. Once the lenses are out, you'll need to rinse them with contact solution to remove any debris that might be causing your eye's irritation.


Squirt a small pool of contact solution in the palm of your hand, then squeeze a few drops into the open ""bowl"" of your lens.
Use your other index finger to gently rub the lens around in the contact solution you've put in your palm. Do not let your fingernail poke the lens.
Shake off the excess solution and repeat for the other contact.While the lenses are out of your eyes, take a moment to examine them for any tears. A torn lens can cause a lot of pain and discomfort, and could damage your eyes.

, After rinsing your lenses (and while your hands are still clean), you're ready to re-insert your contact lenses into your eyes. You'll need to take great care to avoid damaging the lens or your eye, particularly with your fingernails.

Use rewetting drops.,
Take anti-inflammatory agents.,
Prevent the causes of dry eyes.",How to Deal With Uncomfortable Contact Lenses3," The most common recommendation for dry eyes is to use rewetting drops or artificial tears. These eye drops can help lubricate dry eyes by replicating the composition and effect of real tears.If you use artificial tears, look for a brand that is preservative-free. The preservatives in regular over-the-counter drops or artificial tears can cause buildup on your contact lens and even cause you to develop an allergy.


Wash your hands before inserting eye drops or touching your eyes in any way.
Gently shake the eye drop container and remove the cap. Avoid touching the applicator tip so you do not contaminate it.
Tilt your head back and hold the bottle upside down against your forehead, directly above your eye.
Use your other hand to gently pull down your lower eyelid and eyelashes, and try to simultaneously raise your upper eyelid without touching it.
Lightly squeeze the bottle until the desired number of drops fall onto your eye.
Close your eye without squeezing it shut and gently dab at the outside of your eye with a clean tissue.
Gently press on the inner part of your eye while your eyes are closed, and hold it for 30 seconds to prolong contact with the eye drops.Carry eye drops with you wherever you go if you are prone to dry or irritated eyes.

, Depending on the severity of your dry eyes, your doctor may recommend an anti-inflammatory agent. This may be in the form of eye drops (like Restasis) or steroids.Anti-inflammatory prescriptions will help treat dry eyes caused by chemicals/medications, heat, or certain autoimmune disorders.

, Some causes of dry eyes, like medications or certain medical conditions, are unavoidable. But other environmental causes can be avoided or diminished with proper planning and care.


Wear eye protection if it is windy outside, and try to limit exposure to the wind.
Avoid smoke.
Try to avoid dry air. Use a humidifier at home if your heating system is drying out the air.Carry eye drops with you wherever you go if you are prone to dry eyes.

Ask your doctor about the fit.,
Try daily disposable contacts.,
Use silicone hydrogel contacts.,
Try contacts FDA-indicated for dry eyes.,
Wear glasses.",How to Deal With Uncomfortable Contact Lenses4," If your lens is fitting you properly, it should rest on a thin film of fluid, which is refreshed each time you blink. A poor-fitting contact will interrupt this process, causing discomfort and potentially leading to a damaged cornea.If your optometrist does not check the fit of your contact lenses, ask her to do so.
Your eye doctor should check the fit of both lenses each time you visit.
A poorly-fitting lens can be easily fixed by adjusting your recommended lens curvature and/or diameter.

, While soft contact lenses are generally considered disposable, some people find that opening a new pair of lenses each day can significantly reduce discomfort. This is particularly helpful for people who suffer from allergies and are exposed to pollen, dander, and other airborne allergens on a daily basis.Some newer daily contact lenses are produced with a ""water gradient"" that improves comfort even more than traditional daily contact lenses.Be aware of the cost. If you dispose of contact lenses after each day's use, you'll need to buy 720 lenses each year (and possibly more if any of your lenses get lost or damaged).Daily disposal of your contacts can quickly add up, though the exact price will depend on where you purchase your contacts and what kind of coverage you have. Most manufacturers are aware of this and will offer rebates to help offset the cost. You may also save money because you won't need contact lens solution or a case.

, Soft lenses made with silicone hydrogel are more ""breathable"" than regular soft contact lenses. That's because the material allows oxygen to flow through the lens, which can help prevent dry eyes. Silicone hydrogel contacts also absorb moisture faster and more effectively than regular contact lenses, further reducing the risk of dry eyes.Silicone hydrogel lenses improve eye comfort, especially while wearing lenses over prolonged periods of time.
Some users report allergy-like reactions that include redness, itchiness, and discomfort while wearing silicone hydrogel contacts; however, there is currently no formal evidence of allergic reactions found by researchers.
If you believe you have a silicone allergy, talk to your doctor before you try wearing silicone hydrogel contact lenses.

, If you experience severe dry eyes, you may find comfort in a contact lens that was specifically designed for your concern. Some soft, disposable contact lenses are acknowledged by the Food and Drug Administration as being able to improve discomfort caused by dryness.If you suffer from severe dry eyes, talk to your optometrist about which lenses might be best for your condition.

, If contacts are causing you discomfort or irritation, your eyes may be more sensitive than other people's eyes. This is okay, and you should consider reducing your use of contacts or avoiding wearing contacts altogether if you believe this may be the case.


Take out your glasses and wear glasses instead any time your eyes are uncomfortable or irritated.

Start with the same eye every time.Choose an eye to start with when inserting and removing your contacts, and always start with that same eye.,
Put your non-dominant hand or a lint-free towel below your eye.,
Position your dominant hand.,
Blink your eye.,
Repeat the process with your other lens.,
Discard daily/single-use contacts.,
Clean multi-use contacts.,
Store your contacts.",How to Take Out Contact Lenses Without Touching Your Eye," This gets rid of any bacteria you might have on your hands that could end up being transferred onto the skin around your eye.Rinse the soap off completely so that the soap does not irritate your eye.Avoid using soaps that are oily or contain lotion, as these will interfere with your contacts., Even the smallest particle can be irritating if you get it on your contact.

, Open your clean lens case and fill it with fresh solution. This allows you to transfer your contacts directly to your lens case, which will help to prevent contaminating your contacts after you remove them.Never re-use your contact solution., This will help you to see what you are doing, which will make removing your contacts easier. It is also helpful to stand over a plugged sink while removing your contacts. That way, if you accidentally drop a contact, it will land in the sink and will be easier to find than if you dropped it onto the floor., Doing so will help you to avoid mixing up your two contacts., This will help you to catch the contact lens when it comes out of your eye. You do not want to drop your contact onto the sink, counter, or floor if you can avoid it because doing so may introduce lint, irritating particles, or bacteria onto your contact., On the eye you have chosen, place the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand on the center of the upper eyelid, near your eyelashes. Place the tip of either your middle finger or your thumb — whichever is most comfortable — on the center of your lower eyelid. Gently pull the eyelids back, away from the eye, and push in.


This will pull your upper and lower eyelids back a little bit, exposing your waterline on each eyelid.The waterline is the inner rim of your eyelid, between your eyelashes and your eye.Do not pull your eyelids back too far. You just want to expose your waterline, not the inside of your eyelid.
Keep your hand steady, and do not dig your fingernails into your eyelid as you press down to avoid injuring yourself.

, While holding your eyelids back and gently pushing down with your two fingers, blink your eye forcefully. When you blink, you should move your two waterlines together by moving the bottom lash line up and the top lash line down. This will squeeze the top and bottom edges of your contact lens. Your lens should fall right out onto your hand or towel. If your lens does not fall out the first time you blink, repeat this step.

, Remove your other contact lens the exact same way you removed the first one.

, Always follow the instructions of your eye doctor and those that come on your box of contacts. Daily contacts are not meant to be worn more than once, so immediately throw them away after you remove them., Improper handling and cleaning of contacts is a major cause of eye infections.Cleaning your multi-use contacts removes any film, dirt, and germs that may have accumulated on your lenses while you were wearing them. Cleaning and disinfecting them is important part of contacts care that you should do every day. Follow the care instructions that came with your contacts and your eye doctor's instructions.Place your lens in your palm and squirt fresh cleansing solution into it.Rub the lens with your finger for 30 seconds.Turn your lens over, and repeat.Squirt contact lens solution onto each side of the contact to rinse thoroughly.
Repeat with your other contact.

, Put your contacts into your contact case. Be sure to put your right contact into the side of the case labeled with an ""R,"" so you don't mix up your contacts. Put your left contact into the unlabeled side of the case. Make sure your contact case is clean, and have fresh solution in the case. Tightly cap your contact case, and put it somewhere you will access easily the next time you want to wear your contacts."

Wash and dry your hands.,
Use eye drops to keep your eyes from drying out.,
Clean your contacts and then put them in.,
Use eyelid primer.,
Choose cream eye shadows instead of powder eye shadows.,
Use a pencil eyeliner on the outer part of your eyelids only.,
Apply hypoallergenic, oil-free mascara.,
Look for makeup that is safe for contact lens wearers.,
Replace your eye makeup every three months.",How to Apply Eye Makeup With Contact Lenses," Before you apply any makeup to your face or put your contacts in, it’s important that you clean your hands well with soap and water. This will ensure no bacteria gets into your eyes as you apply your makeup and touch your contact lenses.;
, Often when you are applying eye makeup, you need to keep your eyes open for longer periods of time. This can cause your eyes to dry out or get irritated, especially if you are wearing contacts. Counteract any dryness by putting eye drops in your eyes before you put your contact lenses in.


You can also try to blink often while putting on your eye makeup to keep your eyes moist.
When buying eye drops to use with your contacts, be sure they they are safe to apply with contact lenses in. Use re-wetting drops or preservative free artificial tears.

, Always put your contacts in before you apply any eye makeup. This will ensure you can see properly as you put on your makeup. This will also prevent you from having to put your contacts in after your eye makeup is done, which could cause some of the makeup to transfer on to your contact or into your eye, leading to discomfort and a possible eye infection.At night when you are ready to remove your eye makeup, always remove your contact lenses first before washing off your makeup.

, Eyelid primer is a light gel that you can apply on your eyelids. It will keep your eye makeup in place, especially eye shadow. This will prevent any eye makeup from getting on your contacts throughout the day or night, especially if you are in a hot or sweaty environment., Cream eye shadows are more compact than powder shadows, so they are less likely to get into your eyes when you apply them. Look for a water based cream eye shadow, as an oil based eye shadow can cause irritation if it gets into your eyes.If you would prefer to use a powder eye shadow, keep your eyes closed as you apply the shadow with a clean makeup brush. You can also hold a tissue under your eye as you apply the powder shadow to catch any excess powder and prevent it from getting into your eyes. Wipe any excess powder off with a tissue once you are done applying the eye shadow., Many makeup tutorials will tell you to apply eyeliner on your inner eyelid, or on the waterline under your eyelashes. But if you wear contact lenses, doing this will put the product right on the lens and close enough to possibly get into your eye. Stick to using a pencil eyeliner on the outer part of your eyelids only, and avoid using gel or liquid eyeliner as these can dry out and flake.Putting eyeliner on the inside, closest to the eye will block glands that are vital to your tear film and increase your risk of dry eyes and hordeolum or styes.

, While it may be tempting to go for “lash-extending” mascara, these products can product micro-flakes that may get into your eyes and irritate your contacts. Waterproof mascara should be avoided, as it cannot be rinsed out easily with water and can stain your contact lenses. Instead, go for mascara that is hypoallergenic, oil-free, and fragrance-free.To apply mascara when wearing contacts, brush the mascara only halfway down the roots of your eyelashes so the product does not touch your eyes.
Glide the mascara brush lightly against your lashes and do not pump the mascara to get more product on the brush, as this lets in air and debris into the mascara. Try not to leave any clumps on your lashes, which can flake off and get into your eyes.
Keep in mind permanent eyelash dyes can cause serious eye injuries and many dyes are not approved by the FDA. They are not recommended for people who wear contact lenses.

, About two thirds of the contact lens population are women, so many cosmetic companies are responding to the demand by creating products that are contact lens friendly. On your next trip to the make-up counter, ask the sales attendant for products that are labeled “ophthalmologist tested” and “approved for contact lens wearers”.If you wear eye make up every day, you may want to consider switching to daily contact lenses. This way, you will start the day with a fresh, make up free pair of lenses every day. Talk to your ophthalmologist about daily contact lenses.

, Though your cosmetics may seem like they can last forever, they do have expiration dates. Switch out your eyeliner and mascara every three months to avoid getting bacteria from the products into your eyes.Another way to confirm its time to replace your mascara is if it starts to have a faint gasoline smell. This means the formula is breaking down and it is more prone to clumping and flaking.If you use makeup brushes around your eyes, wash them once a week and let them air dry before you use them again.

Refill your case with new solution.,
Clean your contact lens case.,
Replace the case regularly.",How to Care for Contact Lenses2," Every time you use your lenses you should empty out and refill the case with fresh solution. Do not just top it up, leaving the remaining drops of old solution in the case. Keep it properly refreshed.Remember to close the lid of your bottles of solution after you use them.Try to avoid touching the top/tip of the contact lens solution bottle to keep it clean.
Replace the solution as per the instructions on the bottle., As well as cleaning your hands and lenses, it's important to keep your lens storage case clean and in good condition too. You should rinse it thoroughly with fresh solution after each use. Don't use water for this.Don't use a towel or cloth to dry your case.
After rinsing out your case, leave it open to dry in the air., You need to keep your case clean, but you will still need to replace it regularly. How often you need to do this will depend on the guidance of your eye doctor and the instructions for the particular product you have.It is, however, recommended that you replace the case every three months."

Don't wear them for longer than you should.,
Don't sleep in them.,
Never wear somebody else's lenses.,
Take them out if they irritate your eyes.,
Know when to visit your eye doctor.",How to Care for Contact Lenses3," You should never keep your lenses in for longer than your eye doctor has recommended. Contact your eye doctor directly if you are uncertain how long you can wear a pair of lenses. Your eye doctor can offer you some guidance and even produce a chart so it is easier for you to to keep track of the time you have worn your contacts., If you find yourself drifting off, make sure to remove your lenses before you fall asleep. Leaving them in while you sleep will dry out and irritate your eyes, so it is to be avoided.There are some lenses designed to be left in while you sleep.
Be completely sure that these are the type you have before sleeping in them.

, This sounds obvious, but it's very important not to share your lenses with anybody, no matter what the circumstances. It would be very unhygienic, and could damage your eyes., If your lenses are irritating your eyes and causing discomfort, don't just leave them in. Remove them, and don't use them again until you've spoken to your eye doctor. If the lenses are contaminated and you keep wearing them any irritation or infection is likely to remain.If your eyes have become a little dried out from wearing lenses, take them out and give your eyes a break.
You can use re-wetting saline drops to refresh dry eyes.

, You should continue to see your eye doctor for regularly scheduled checks.But if you experience more serious symptoms it is important to contact your doctor quickly. If you suffer a sudden loss of vision, persistent blurred vision, or light flashes you should act quickly. Other symptoms that you should look out for are:


Pain in your eyes.
Swelling, or unusual redness.
Prolonged irritation or watering."

Check the lifespan of the contact lens.,
Prep the contact lens case.,
Check the lens for damage.,
Find a contact cleaning solution.,
Wash your hands with soap and water.,
Clean the lens gently.,
Shut the lens in the case.,
Gently shake the case.,
Consider other treatments.",How to Clean Contact Lenses," Check the packaging your contacts came in to find the maximum time you should wear a single pair. If you've passed this deadline, toss the lenses and replace them. Otherwise, clean the contacts daily unless they are prescribed as extended wear. Extended wear contacts should be cleaned on the schedule prescribed by the doctor, usually once a week. Clean immediately whenever your eyes start to itch, because you could risk eye damage.


You should not need to wash one-day lenses.
Contact lenses that can be worn longer than one month are very rare nowadays. If you've been wearing them this long, talk to your optician to confirm that this is correct.
If you have trouble remembering, note the day you change lenses on a calendar.;
, Before you remove your contact lens, prep the case by rinsing it and adding new solution. This way you can place the lens directly in the case rather than on a paper towel or trying to keep it on your finger while you clean the case. This makes for less risk of the lens drying out, picking up dust and debris, or getting lost.


Always use new cleaning solution. If the solution you suspend the lenses in is dirty, your lenses will get dirty.

, Take out the lens and examine it closely, on the tip of your finger. If you see any dirt stuck to the sides of the lens, return it to its case and move on to the next step. If you can't see dirt, hold the lens up to the light. Itching could be caused by a tear, bump, or other deformation. If you see anything like this, throw out the lenses and replace them.


Repeat for the second lens as well.

, Every optician should provide this solution along with your lenses. If you've run out, you can buy more online or at a drugstore. Make sure you're using a cleaning solution intended for daily lens storage, and for your type of lenses (hard or soft). Do not put your lenses back in or continue with these steps until you have the solution.

, Dry your hands with a paper towel or lint-free cloth. Normal towels leave lint, which can dirty and damage your lenses.


Wash off any eye makeup as well.
Water left on your hands can get trapped under the lenses, causing them to bulge.

, Clean the lenses as follows, one at a time:


Place one contact lens in your palm, with the part that goes on your eye facing up.
Place exactly one drop of cleansing solution on the lens. Let it soak for a few seconds.
Place your finger on the lens and move it up and down, then left and right. Do not move in circles, as this risks tearing the lens.

, After cleaning each lens, put it back into its proper compartment of the lens case. Make sure both compartments are tightly shut.

, It may sound bizarre, but this actually helps to remove any lingering dirt in the lens. Don't shake it too hard, to avoid damaging the lenses. Leave your contact(s) in your closed case for as long as recommended by the manufacturer. It may take a few minutes to several hours to disinfect them.


If your contacts still cause you pain after cleaning, it's damage, not dirt. Throw out the contacts and put in a new pair.

, If the lenses are still dirty or blurry, you may need to try a different option. Talk to your optician, or consider these options:


If your lenses look blurry, try a contact lens solution intended to remove protein deposits. Check the instructions, as the cleaning process may be different.
Keep extremely dirty lenses in a stronger disinfecting contact lens solution for several hours. These powerful solutions can damage your eyes if used incorrectly, so you should always follow the exact instructions that came with your product.
There are machines that will clean the contacts without solution, but these are intended for convenience, not for extra-strength cleaning. Follow accompanying instructions exactly to avoid damaging the lenses.
Visit your eye doctor if irritation persists. Conditions such as giant papillary conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis can make contact lens wear uncomfortable and require treatment beyond cleaning the contact lens.

Get a prescription for antibiotics.,
Take over-the-counter medication to reduce your fever and headache symptoms.",How to Treat Walking Pneumonia1," If you are diagnosed with walking pneumonia caused by bacteria, you will be prescribed an antibiotic.Your medical provider will choose an antibiotic based on your history and presentation. You may also have to do a sputum culture test to identify the type of bacteria present in your lungs for picking the right antibiotic. There are several antibiotics are usually prescribed for the treatment of walking pneumonia, including macrolide antibiotics, which are often prescribed for children and adults. Fluoroquinolones are often given to adults and are not recommended for young children. Tetracyclines can be prescribed for adults and older children.


Consult your medical provider for the best choice of antibiotic for you. Early treatment of your pneumonia with an antibiotic can prevent you from developing life-threatening complications.
Your doctor may suggest that you eat yogurt or take probiotic supplements to ensure you have enough healthy gut bacteria while taking the antibiotics.
Use a bronchodilator or inhaler. These are useful for those who experience difficulty breathing, a tight chest, or wheezing. These medications help to open up the alveoli of the lungs and facilitated oxygenation and riding off mucus containing bacteria.;
, Over-the-counter (OTC) medication can help reduce symptoms like fever and headache, though it will not cure your infection. Take aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin IB) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).To help loosen and rid of secretions that harbor bacteria in your lungs you may choose mucolytic OTC products such as Mucinex. Make sure to drink a full glass of water with your mucolytic medicine.
OTC medication can interact negatively with prescription medication, such as blood pressure medications. Talk to your doctor before you take OTC medication for walking pneumonia if you are taking prescription medication.

Let your body rest.,
Have highly nutritious, easy to digest foods.",How to Treat Walking Pneumonia2," Drinking lots of fluids will help maintain secretion and expectorate from your lungs, which will help to clean out the infection. You can add honey and lemon to hot water to get a boost of vitamin C, especially if you have a sore throat.


You can also have green tea, as it contain antioxidants, and fruit juices, which contain vitamins and minerals.

, Rest is essential to recovering from walking pneumonia, as your body will need to focus its energies on fighting off the infection. Try to put your feet up and stay in bed, even if this means missing an appointment or a class.

, Focus on maintaining a diet of soups, such as chicken soup or chicken bouillon, and small, nutritious meals throughout the day. You do not want to tire out your body with big meals but you should try to provide your immune system with nutrients so it can fight off the virus.Start with an egg and mushroom omelette for breakfast. Eggs are a good source of zinc, which can boost your immune system, and are also easy to digest. Mushrooms also contain glucans. Add a pinch of cayenne pepper to your omelette to help break down the mucus in your lungs and increase drainage.
Prepare yogurt with fruit for lunch or as a snack. The active cultures in yogurt can help to improve your gut bacteria and your immune system.
Make a dinner with foods that are high in vitamin C and antioxidants. These include red peppers, oranges, berries, and leafy green vegetables. You should also include foods high in beta-carotenes and vitamin A, such as carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes. Go for yellow or orange colored foods.

Do an herbal steam treatment.,
Take vitamin supplements.",How to Treat Walking Pneumonia3," You can make your own echinacea tea or buy it at your local health food store. Echinacea has antibacterial and antiviral properties that can help to fight off the symptoms of walking pneumonia. Make your own echinacea tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of the dried herb in one cup of boil water for five to ten minutes.You can also make your own elderberry tea or buy elderberry tea at your local health food store. Elderberry can help to treat respiratory infections and is often popular with kids., Garlic has powerful antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties that can fight against walking pneumonia.Mince 1 teaspoon garlic and add it to a cup of boiling water to steep. You can also add garlic to your chicken soup or other easy to digest foods you eat while sick.

, Ginger can help to settle an upset stomach and also has antiviral and antibacterial properties. You can make your own ginger tea by steeping chopped ginger in hot water or buy ginger tea at your local health food store.Ginger tea is safe for consumption by pregnant women and children.

, Inhaling boiled herbs can help to clean out your lungs and throat of the virus.


Start by boiling two inches of water in a pot over the stove and then turn off the heat. Add ½ teaspoon of thyme, oregano, and one to two drops of eucalyptus essential oil.
Use a towel to cover your head and hover 12 – 15 inches away from the steam. Make a tent over your head with the towel and inhale the steam through your mouth and nose.

, Load up on minerals and vitamins by taking supplements like vitamin C.You can also take zinc supplements. Only take the recommended amount on the label, as zinc can be toxic in high amounts.
Consider taking selenium supplements, an essential mineral that can help with antioxidant reactions. Some people lack selenium due to the soil that is selenium deficient in their area. Only take up to 100 mcg/day of selenium.
Take probiotic supplement as antibiotics destroy your healthy gut flora.

Notice if you feel muscle weakness or can't move.,
Speak and see if your speech is slurred.,
Look in the mirror to see if your eyelids are drooping.,
Breathe deeply to see if you have any trouble or shortness of breath.,
Check your vision to see if you are seeing blurry or double.,
Assess symptoms in infants differently.",How to Test for Botulism1," Difficulty coordinating movements, such as walking, is a common sign of botulism. Muscle tone is lost when the body is affected by botulism.


Usually, muscle tone loss spreads from your shoulders to your arms and down to the legs. The toxin acts on the nervous system impacting both voluntary and involuntary nervous system functions. It causes a descending paralysis, meaning it acts from head to toe, in that order.
The paralysis is symmetric, meaning it affects both sides of the body the same, in contrast to the neurologic symptoms one may see in a stroke, which affect only one side of the body.
Muscle weakness is one of the first symptoms and can manifest as difficulties with speech, vision, and breathing.
These symptoms are all caused by the toxin affecting the nerves and their receptors that control organs and muscles.;
, Speech is affected because the neurotoxin produced by C. botulinum can affect the speech centers in your brain. When these cranial nerves are affected, it causes problems with speech and mouth movement.


The neurotoxin affects the cranial nerves 11 and 12, the nerves responsible for speech.

, Ptosis (drooping of eyelids) happens because of the neurotoxin affecting cranial nerve 3, which is responsible for the eye’s movement, pupil size and eyelid motion. An affected person's pupils will be dilated and vision will be blurry, too.


Eyelid drooping can occur in one eye or both eyes at the same time.

, Problems with breathing can occur due to the effect of botulism on your respiratory system. The botulism neurotoxin can cause reduced respiratory muscle activity and impaired gas exchange.


This damage can cause respiratory failure and breathing problems.

, Blurry and double vision can occur when botulism damages cranial nerve number 2. This nerve is responsible for your sense of sight, carrying images to the brain.

, In infants progressive decreased muscle tone can present as a “floppy” infant that feels similar to a “rag doll.” Symptoms can also present as decreased or poor feeding due to decreased muscular ability to nurse or take the bottle.Other symptoms in infants include: a weak cry, dehydration, and decreased tear production.
The immature immune system is unable to mount an immune response to this spore, which then germinates in the digestive tract and excretes its toxin."

Know when to suspect an MRSA infection.,
Get tested if you've had contact with someone else who has MRSA.,
Get tested if your immune system is compromised.,
Have a culture done.,
Get the nasal passage tested.,
Have a blood test.,
Take antibiotics you are prescribed.,
Avoid spreading it to others.",How to Test for MRSA," If you have a cut that isn't healing properly, MRSA may be the cause. Infections caused by MRSA don't necessarily look different from other types of infections. Here are the hallmarks of an MRSA infection:A red, raised sore that looks like a spider bite
A swollen and pus-filled cut
A fluid-filled blister with a honey-colored crust
An area of red, firm skin that is warm or hot to the touch;
, Since MRSA is spread by skin contact, it's wise to get tested if you have been in contact with someone you know to have MRSA.

, This will include elderly individuals, those who are infected with HIV, or someone with cancer.

, A health care professional will swab the wound and take a culture test. This is taken to a lab for further investigation. The laboratory will place the culture test into a solution and examine it for MRSA. If the sample contains Gram-positive cocci clusters, MRSA is likely the culprit.The sample is also tested for Staphylococcus aureus. This is performed with a latex agglutination test. The sample is placed in a tube that holds rabbit plasma and free coagulase. If staph is present, a clump will form and further testing will be done to determine whether or not the bacterium is resistant to antibiotics.
If MRSA is present, the specimen will continue to grow at the same rate despite the medicine. This process only takes one or two days.

, Another MRSA test involves swabbing the nostrils. A sterile swab is used to collect a sample that is placed in incubation and observed for the presence of MRSA. The lab process is similar to what is conducted with the swab from a wound. Within 48 hours, there will be an answer to the test., The FDA has recently developed a new blood test for MRSA. Clinical tests were done and showed positive results. These tests managed to identify all positive specimens of the MRSA bacteria. They give faster results than with tests that involve swabbing. They are meant to be used on people who are likely to have a staph infection, but must be backed up with other tests.

, If you have an infection, your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics. Take the full course, even if your symptoms improve quickly. If your symptoms don't go away, call your doctor., If you have MRSA, you should avoid touching other people. Wash your hands often, especially before you eat or prepare food, before and after using the bathroom, and before and after changing your dressings. This will help prevent other people from getting MRSA.


You may want to clean surfaces you routinely touch, like keyboards and electronics.MRSA can't be spread through the air.

Visit your doctor if you recognize the above symptoms.,
Undergo a physical examination to get a preliminary diagnosis.,
Your doctor will look for additional symptoms, which include: decreased or absent lachrymation (tearing), fixed and dilated pupils, decreased deep tendon reflexes, extremely dry mouth, urinary retention as unable to empty the bladder, and inability to perform basic functions such as walking, speech and coordinating movements.,
Get a series of diagnostic tests to confirm botulism.",How to Test for Botulism2," Botulism is a serious disease, and it is important that you see a doctor immediately if you suspect you may have contracted botulism.


These symptoms usually manifest 18 to 36 hours after exposure to botulinus.
Once symptoms are felt, immediate medical intervention is required.

, After you have noticed botulism symptoms, immediately go to a hospital and have yourself checked by a doctor.

, There may also be decreased or absent bowel sounds on examination of the abdomen, which may be distended.


An infant may present with generalized hypotonia (decreased muscle tone).
In severe cases, the infected person may have respiratory failure or Hypoxemia (low oxygen level).
Your doctor will also ask you if you had an open wound or have ingested contaminated food within 24 – 48 hours.

, There are several diagnostic tests used to confirm botulism that can be ordered by your physician. Your doctor may order one, or all, of them to confirm the infection.


Lab: Positive culture of vomit, saliva, nasogastric secretions, stool, or blood or suspicious food for the bacteria, C Botulinum.Electromyography: An electromyelogram will demonstrate neuromuscular findings and assist in confirming the diagnosis. The EMG usually has two parts: a nerve conduction study, which uses electrodes taped to your skin to evaluate your motor neurons and a needle electrode exam, which uses a small needle inserted into your muscles to evaluate your muscles’ electrical activity.Radiography: Abdominal radiographs will show a “paralytic ileus,” or lack of normal gastric motility, which results in the distention of the small bowel. A spinal tap may also be needed to rule out other causes of a patient's symptoms.

Treat the dangerous symptoms of botulism.,
Decrease toxin load.,
Treat wounds, in appropriate cases.",How to Test for Botulism3," If the patient has low oxygen levels for any reason, airway management is essential. A breathing tube and ventilation will be used in extreme cases.


In some cases it is necessary to insert a nasogastric tube to drain stomach contents and oral secretions. Assisted feeding may also be required.

, If patient is awake and, still importantly, has bowel sounds, the doctor may consider the cautious use of enemas or antiemetics to decrease the load of toxin. A bladder catheter may be inserted for drainage of urine, as toxins can cause urinary retention.


An antitoxin is available for children older than one year and adults, if the diagnosis of botulism is confirmed. Antibiotics are only given for wound botulism.

, The doctor or surgeon should decontaminate wound causes of botulism via irrigation and debridement. In addition, your doctor should prescribe antibiotics (high dose penicillin) and antitoxin.

Utilize proper technique for canning and dispose of expired food products properly.,
Do not give infants less than one year old honey or corn syrup.,
Cleanse any wounds with hot-warm water and soap.",How to Test for Botulism4," Throw away any canned products that appear dented or bulging. This is especially important with home canning products, such as preserves., These products can harbor the botulism bacteria. This does not affect most adults but can infect infants, because of small children's weaker immune systems.There are about 115 cases of Infant Botulism each year. There is a caution about giving children under the age of one raw honey, however this was found to be the culprit in only 15% of cases. In 85% of cases, the causes were unknown but included possible contaminated formula, corn syrup, or some form of cross contamination from a caregiver who had contact with spores., Keep bandaged if outdoors.If you suspect wound botulism, see a medical professional immediately.


Launder soiled clothing appropriately with hot water and detergent if worn by an agriculture worker or laborer.
Wound botulism can also infect people who use intravenous needles on a regular basis. Use safer needle handling practices or avoid the use of intravenous needles altogether.

Try foot exercises.,
Wear a bunion pad or shoe inserts to realign toes.,
Tape your foot and toes into a normal alignment position.,
Relieve the pain.,
For mild to moderate bunions, a flexible bunion splint such as ""Bunion-Aid"" has been scientifically proven to effectively correct Hallux valgus and relieve bunion pain.",How to Get Rid of Bunions1," Exercises can help slow or even halt the progression of your bunion, preventing the need to eventually get surgery.Try the following exercises every day, especially after removing your shoes:


Stretch your big toe. Use your fingers to pull your big toe into proper alignment with the rest of your toes.
Stretch the rest of your toes. Simply point them straight ahead for 10 seconds, then curl them under for 10 seconds. Repeat several times.
Flex your toes. Press your toes against the floor or a wall until they are bent back. Hold them for 10 seconds, then release. Repeat several times.
Grip with your toes. Practice picking up an article of clothing or a towel with your toes, dropping it, then picking it up again.;
, If you catch your bunion in the early stages, a bunion pad purchased at any pharmacy or drugstore may help to alleviate pain and direct your toe back to the proper direction. Shoe inserts may also help to realign your toes when you are wearing shoes.

, Your toes may adapt to the normal position after being taped for a week or two. Ask your doctor if you need assistance with this process.

, Exercising your feet and toes is well and good, but the intense pain bunions cause should also be addressed. Ease sore feet using the following methods:


Soak your feet in warm water.Prepare a bowl with warm water and allow your feet to soak for twenty minutes. The warmth will sooth your joints and temporarily alleviate the pain.
Try an ice pack. For particularly bad flare-ups, ice packs are a good choice. Fill a plastic bag with ice and wrap it in a thin towel. Apply the ice pack in twenty-minute increments several times a day.
Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, to relieve the pain.

The blood vessels around your knee can get compressed with leg crossing or other contorted positions. Furthermore, the nerves that innervate your foot muscles are positioned next to the blood vessels, so some nerve entrapment or compression is not unusual either. As such, simply change your position by uncrossing your legs so that your foot gets its proper blood supply and nerve input.The foot that you cross over is typically the one that ""falls asleep.""
As the blood starts to flow properly into your foot again, it should feel a little warmer and somewhat prickly for a few minutes.;
, In addition to changing your leg position (if leg crossing caused the pins and needles in your feet), stand up from your chair in order to promote better circulation. When you stand up, you enlist the help of gravity, which helps pull the blood from the upper leg into the foot. Arteries have smooth muscle fibers that contract and push the blood down in correlation with your heart beating, but standing up might make the process occur a little quicker.Moving your foot in all directions (circular motions for 15-20 seconds) will likely help with circulation also and reduce the numbness or pins and needles sensation a little quicker.
While standing, a light leg stretch (such as bending at the waist and trying to touch your toes) might help ""wake up"" your feet also.

, After switching positions and un-kinking blood vessels and/or nerves of your lower leg, consider walking around to promote better circulation. The main caveat here is, make sure your have some feeling and normal strength in your foot otherwise you risk tripping or collapsing and causing an injury.Once you change your position, pins and needles in the feet don't last for more than a few minutes.
Permanent foot damage can occur if blood flow is restricted and nerves are compressed for many hours.Simply shaking your asleep foot may be a safer alternative to walking if you still feel significant numbness or pins and needles.

, Pins and needles and/or numbness of the foot is sometimes caused by poorly fitting shoes. Cramming your feet into a narrow shoe is not good for circulation or nerve flow and may cause your feet to fall asleep — particularly if you walk or stand a lot.As such, choose shoes that grip your heel tightly, support your arches, provide enough room to wiggle your toes, and are made of breathable materials (such as a leather insole).


Avoid wearing narrow-toed high heels.
If your foot symptoms are primarily on the top part of your foot, then try loosening your laces.
Get fitted for your shoes by a shoe salesperson later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.When at your desk at work, consider taking your shoes off so your feet are less constricted and can breathe.

, In some cases, pins and needles in your feet might be caused by tight or strained muscles of your lower leg, such as your calves. Soaking your feet and lower legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can stimulate circulation and significantly reduce pain and muscle tension.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. If inflammation and swelling is a problem for you then follow the warm salt bath with an ice bath until your feet feel numb (about 15 minutes or so).


Always dry your feet thoroughly before you get up and walk away from your foot bath in order to prevent slips and falls.
A dietary lack of minerals (such as calcium or magnesium) or vitamins (such as B6 or B12) can contribute to uncomfortable symptoms in your feet and legs.

, Get a massage therapist or sympathetic friend to give you a foot and calf massage. Massage reduces muscle tension and promotes better blood flow.Start rubbing from the toes and work towards the calf so you help the venous blood return back to the heart. Allow the therapist (or friend) to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
Consider applying peppermint massage lotion to your feet also, as it will tingle and invigorate them in a good way.

, Yoga is an aspect of traditional Indian culture that encourages health by proper breathing, meditation and placing the body into various challenging poses.In addition to stimulating energy flow, the body poses act to stretch and strengthen your muscles and improve your overall posture. Increasing your flexibility, particularly in your legs, might prevent your feet from falling asleep when your cross your legs or put them in other contorted positions.


As a beginner, yoga poses might create some soreness in the muscles of your legs and other areas — it should fade away in a few days.
If certain yoga poses increase the pins and needles in your feet, then stop immediately and ask your instructor for feedback on your technique.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin and/or muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation and promote better circulation.Acupuncture for chronically poor leg circulation and associated symptoms can be effective, although it's not commonly recommended by medical doctors. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce discomfort.


Acupuncture points that may help your foot and leg symptoms are not all located near where you feel the symptoms — some can be in distant parts of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, If your feet seem to constantly be asleep and involve other symptoms such as pain, weakness, temperature changes or discoloration, then it's time to schedule an appointment with your physician.Your doctor will examine your feet and legs and ask questions about your family history, diet and lifestyle, and maybe even send you for a blood test (to check blood glucose levels and rule out the possibility of diabetes).


Your family doctor is not a neurological or circulatory specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.

, Feet that fall asleep on occasion is not considered a serious medical problem, just more of an annoyance, but there are some serious conditions that can cause similar symptoms such as diabetic neuropathy, venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves of the lower leg), chronic compartment syndrome (swelling of the lower leg muscles), or Peripheral artery disease (PAD).As such, a medical specialist may be needed to properly diagnose your condition, such as a vascular surgeon, a neurologist or an orthopedist (musculoskeletal specialist).


Foot symptoms related to diabetic neuropathy include: numbness and tingling, reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes, muscle cramps, burning pain, muscle weakness, painful ulcers that won't heal, pain from a light touch, toenail changes.Risk factors for developing neuropathy include type 1 and type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and hypertension. Cardiovascular disease at baseline is associated with double the risk of neuropathy.
Common symptoms of venous insufficiency include: swelling in the lower legs and ankles, aching or tiredness in the legs, discolored leathery-looking skin on the feet and lower legs, numbness and tingling, stasis ulcers.Diagnosis is made on venous ultrasound with a reversed flow.
Risk factors for venous insufficiency include: increasing age, family history, prolonged standing, increases in BMI, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and lower extremity trauma.
Vascular ultrasound is a painless procedure that allows a doctor to assess the function of the veins and arteries of your lower leg.
PAD is a disease of the lower extremity arteries and is characterized by painful muscle cramping in the hips, thighs or calves when walking, climbing stairs, or exercising; this pain will dissipate when you rest.The pain is an indication that your legs and feet aren't receiving sufficient blood flow. PAD increases your risk of coronary artery disease, stroke and heart attack.Risk factors for PAD include: age greater that 70, history of smoking or diabetes, abnormal pulse, and known atherosclerosis.
Neurologists can order a nerve conduction study (NCS) and/or an electromyelography (EMG) to test the ability of the nerves in your feet and legs in transmitting electrical messages.

, A podiatrist is a foot specialist who can give you another informed opinion about your foot issue if it's lingering and becoming a chronic problem. A podiatrist will examine your foot for any trauma that may have damaged any nerves or benign growths or tumors that are irritating and/or compressing nerves or blood vessels. A podiatrist can also prescribe custom-made shoes or orthotics (shoe inserts) for your feet to increase comfort and protection.


A neuroma is a benign growth of nerve tissue often found between the third and fourth toes, which can cause pain and pins and needles in the feet."

Consult a physician.,
Take prescribed pain medication.,
Consider surgery.",How to Get Rid of Bunions2," If you are experiencing extreme pain that seems to be getting worse, or if your feet no longer fit in your shoes, consult a physician right away. It's possible to slow or halt the progression of bunions, but you can't actually cure them on your own.

, In some cases the doctor will advise you as to lifestyle changes and prescribe a medication for the pain. To prevent the bunion from getting worse, be sure to follow the doctor's advice.

, As a last resort, consider having surgery to remove the bunion, shave the bone of your big toe and realign your big toe with the other toes. Bunion surgery is common and considered to be the only cure for bunions.


There are several options for a bunionectomy surgery. Conduct research with your doctor to find out which option is best for you.
Surgery usually helps bunions, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be completely free of pain, or that your toe will look perfectly straight.
Follow up the surgery with proper lifestyle changes and exercises to prevent future pain and inflammation.

Go barefoot.,
See if your shoes are making your bunions worse.,
Avoid activities that lead to bunions.",How to Get Rid of Bunions3," Whether you inherited a propensity toward getting bunions from one of your parents or your bunions are the result of a lifetime of wearing shoes that are too tight, spending as much time as possible walking barefoot can prevent and even heal bunions. Walking barefoot strengthens the muscles in your feet and helps the bones realign in their natural position, rather than having to conform to the shape of your shoes.However, if your bunions are advanced and very painful, walking barefoot can make them feel worse. If this is the case, only walk barefoot on thickly carpeted floors. Otherwise, wear padded socks when you're walking around the house and doing your daily activities.
Wearing thick, comfortable slippers around the house is another option to help ease the pain of your bunions without subjecting your feet to the pressure of wearing shoes.

, You may think they are comfortable and good for your feet, but even tennis shoes and other athletic shoes could be making your bunions worse. Wear supportive shoes with good padding and arches. If you're in doubt about what type of shoe to buy, ask your doctor for advice.


Make sure that your shoes are the right size for you. Wearing shoes that are too small can make bunions a lot worse. When you're trying on shoes, your big toe should never touch the end of your shoe. Use the thumb rule: make sure that there is a thumb's width of room between the tip of your big toe and the end of your shoe.
Don't wear high heels or pointy toes. They're pretty, but heels and stylish pointy-toed shoes are terrible for bunions. They lead to additional pain and prevent the bunion from healing. Wear less restrictive sandals whenever possible.

, Ballet dancing, and other activities requiring constrictive shoes, may lead to bunions. If it isn't possible to do the activity in shoes that are healthier for your feet, avoid the activity altogether.

Understand how you can prevent rubella from spreading.",How to Treat Rubella," Viral illnesses like rubella are usually associated with weakness and the feeling that you do not want to get out of bed. This is how our body tell us that we need more rest and sleep.


During sleep, the immune system releases cytokines. Cytokines are protein molecules that help to fight off inflammation and infection by telling the immune system which specific viral cells it should be attacking.When you are recovering from rubella (or any viral illness) It is recommended that you get at least 8 to 10 hours sleep a day to allow your body to fight off the infection.;
, Rubella causes fever, which in turn causes your body to sweat more. This results in a loss of fluid, leading to dehydration.


To replace these lost fluids and prevent dehydration, you should aim to drink at least 10 glasses of water per day.
If you have difficulty drinking this much fluid, you can also increase your water intake by drinking herbal teas and by eating fruit and veg with a high water content, such as watermelon, tomatoes, celery, beets, grapefruit and melon.

, One of the major symptoms of rubella is an itchy rash which can be very irritating. You can use calamine lotion (available over-the-counter at most pharmacies) to provide relief for this itchy rash.


Calamine lotion works using a counter-irritant effect. Once applied, it evaporates off the surface off the skin, producing a cooling effect that minimizes the itch.
You can apply calamine lotion to the affected skin using a piece of cotton wool. Do this three times a day, or as necessary.

, Vitamin C boosts the immune system by triggering the production of phagocytes which are cells that kill foreign bodies by ingesting them. This helps your body to fight off the rubella virus more quickly.


Be sure to get your daily those of Vitamin C by eating fruits and vegetables with every major meal. Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C include:
Blackberries, blueberries, broccoli, raw green cabbage, cauliflower, cranberries, garlic, grapefruit, kale, lemon, lime, mandarin orange, mango, melon, orange, papaya, passion fruit, pineapple, potato, raspberries, spinach, strawberries, tangerine and tomato.

, If you are experiencing symptoms of rubella such as muscle or joint pain, headache or fever, your doctor may advise you to take over-the-counter pain medications to relieve these symptoms. Such medications include Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.


These medications work by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin E2 which causes the cells in the hypothalamus (brain part that regulates temperature) to fire at a rapid rate, therefore increasing the body’s temperature. This helps to bring down fever. These medicines also work by blocking specific body chemicals that send pain signals to the brain.

Note: Aspirin is not recommended for children suffering from viral illnesses because it can lead to the development of Reye Syndrome (rare disease that damages the brain and liver) that can be fatal.

, Hyperimmune globulin is an antibody given to pregnant women who have been exposed to rubella. It helps to fight against off the infection and reduce its symptoms. However, the developing baby inside the womb is still at risk. Hyperimmune globulin fights and destroys the rubella virus in three ways:


It binds directly to any foreign bodies in your system and coats their surface, making them unable to enter or damage healthy cells.
It stimulates other parts of the immune system in order to destroy foreign bodies.
It marks foreign bodies so that they can be easily identified and destroyed by the immune system’s cells

, Rubella often leads to dehydration, as your body uses more water to fight off infection and the associated fever causes you to sweat more.


In cases of severe dehydration, you will need to have lost fluids replaced through an intravenous line at the hospital or doctor's office.
This is done by having a sterile needle inserted in your arm, which is connected to a tube and fluid bottle.

, Low grade fever (37.2°C – 37.8°C or 99°F - 100°F) is a symptoms of Rubella. Fever is one of the body's defense mechanisms against infection, as the heat kills off microorganisms causing the disease.


When the body’s immune system senses foreign bodies, pyrogens (substances that cause fever) are released and travel to the hypothalamus (part of the brain which regulates body temperature).
The pyrogens now bind to the receptors in the hypothalamus and the body’s temperature starts to rise, resulting in fever.

, When you are suffering from enlarged lymph nodes, the back of the neck, behind the ears and the base of the skull is tender and a lump can be felt. This is the hallmark of rubella.


Lymph nodes help the body fight infection by sending out disease-fighting cells and compounds and carrying white blood cells around the body. The lymph nodes themselves are small, bean-shaped glands that are distributed in different parts of the body such as the neck, groin and armpit.
Viruses, bacteria and other foreign bodies are trapped in the lymph nodes (causing the swelling) and are destroyed by lymphocytes, which are special white blood cells.

, One of the main symptoms of rubella is an itchy rash that typically begins on the face and spreads rapidly to trunk and extremities.


At the end of the 2nd day, the rash begins to fade in the order that it appeared and by the 3rd day the rash has usually disappears.
The medical term used to describe this type of rash is maculopapular - which is a combination of both flat, red patches and raised red bumps. , Rubella infection triggers the occurrence of headaches, as the body struggles to fight the infection. However, it's not entirely clear why the pain signals causing the headache are triggered in the first place., Rubella infection sometimes alters a person's normal eating habits of. When higher body temperatures occur (above 98.6 degree F) the link between a person's taste buds and the brain stops working, leading to a loss of taste. Without a sense of taste, people tend to lost their appetites.

, With rubella, the lining of the eyelids and eyeballs sometimes becomes inflamed. This happens as a result of the same bacterial emboli (free flowing blood clot) that causes the maculopapular rash. Conjunctivitis results in inflamed eyelids and eyeballs.

, Whenever rubella infection is present, an aching joint pain can usually be felt. This is due to the secretion of inflammatory chemicals by the immune system, which causes muscles and joints to swell. Pain receptors in these muscles and joints then send pain signals to the brain, causing an aching sensation.

, Due to the presence of the rubella infection, a runny nose may occur. A runny nose keeps germs, dirt, pollen and bacteria from getting into your lungs by stopping them in your nose. When you blow your nose, the germs, dirt, bacteria and other microorganisms trapped in the mucus are expelled.

, Rubella (German measles or three-day measles) is an acute viral infection that affects both children and adults. It is caused by the rubella virus. Those who are affected usually experiences rash, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes.


This illness can resemble an attack of measles (rubeola) and can cause arthritis, especially in adults.
Rubella is fatal during pregnancy because it can lead to fetal infection, a condition termed as congenital rubella syndrome.
Rubella is common during the springtime and it usually affects school-aged children.

, Rubella is transmitted through direct contact with nasopharyngeal (nose and throat) secretions. It can also spread through air droplets which target the respiratory tract and the blood stream.


In congenital rubella, transplacental transmission may occur. This is when the virus is spread from mother to the baby through the placenta., Health care professionals usually perform laboratory examinations to confirm rubella infection. These tests may include:



Nasal and throat swab: Cell cultures will be done to confirm the presence of the rubella virus. Samples of mucus from blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid can also be examined.Blood Test: The test will detect the presence of different rubella antibodies in the blood, indicating recent or past exposure to rubella virus or a rubella vaccination. It is usually recommended for women before becoming pregnant.
Convalescent Serum. A fourfold rise in the antibody titers confirms the diagnosis of rubella.

, The rubella virus can be prevented using the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) combination vaccine.


This vaccination is usually given to infants at 12 to 15 months old, but when epidemics occur the vaccination is given earlier. A second dose of the vaccine (known as a booster) is given at 4 to 6 years of age before entering to school.It is particularly important for girls to receive the MMR vaccination in order to prevent rubella from affecting their future pregnancies.
Women of childbearing age who are planning to become pregnant should make sure that they have immunity to rubella. If they are not immune, they should be vaccinated at least one month before conceiving. Pregnant women cannot be given the rubella vaccine.
In addition, people people who have previously been infected with rubella acquire lifelong immunity to the infection.

, Rubella is a mild infection and complications are rare. However in some cases people infected with rubella may experience complications such as:



Miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects: These could happen if the mother becomes infected with rubella while conceiving. The unborn child is most at risk during the first trimester because this is when the development of major organs takes place.

Arthritis: The fingers, wrist and knees can be affected and could last for a month.

Otitis Media: This is an infection in the ear.

Encephalitis: This is inflammation of the brain.

, Anyone who is infected with the rubella virus should be isolated in order to contain the spread of infection.


This isolation should last for ten days or until the disease abates. The room should be well ventilated and dark to prevent photophobia.
Anyone who enters the room should use a mask and gloves when coming in close contact with the infected individual. Afterwards, proper hand washing should be done.

Protect your knee from further pain or injury.,
Rest your knee.,
Ice your knee.,
Compress the area around your knee.,
Elevate your leg.",How to Get Rid of Knee Pain from Running1," If you have been injured or if you just notice that it hurts to put pressure on your knee, the first thing you should do is protect your knee by getting off of it. For example, if you are out walking somewhere, sit down or ask a friend to let you lean on her until you can reach a safe place to sit.Do not try to walk or run through the pain. If your knee hurts from running, then continuing to run or even walk on it may make it worse.
See a doctor or go to an emergency room if the pain is severe.;
, Plan to take a few days off from running as well as other activities that put pressure on your knee, such as walking, biking, and skiing.You should not return to your normal exercise routine until your knee has healed.


Try using crutches or ask someone to help you when you need to get out of a chair or walk to another room. Put as little pressure on the injured knee as possible.
If you are being treated for a knee injury, then ask your doctor how long you will need to rest your knee.
Knee soreness from running should improve after a couple of rest days.If your knee does not improve after a couple of rest days, then see your doctor.

, Ice your knee four or five times per day to reduce swelling and pain. Keep in mind that you should not apply ice to bare skin. Wrap an ice pack, some ice cubes, or a frozen bag of peas in a towel before applying to your knee. Hold the ice pack on your knee for about 15 to 20 minutes each time.Make sure that you give your knee breaks in between icings to allow the skin to return to normal temperature. After icing your knee, wait for about one to two hours before icing your knee again.

, Wrap your knee with an athletic or elastic bandage to compress the area while still allowing your knee to move.You can buy an elastic bandage in a drug store. Wear the knee wrap whenever you are not icing your knee.


Make sure that you do not wrap the area too tight or it may cut off circulation. Try to make the bandage tight enough to support your knee, but not so tight that it is cutting off your circulation., You should also raise the affected knee and leg to a level that is above your heart whenever you are lying down.This strategy can help to reduce swelling in your knee. At night, you can place the affected leg up on a couple of pillows to raise it above your heart. During the day, try lying down in a recliner or sofa with your leg propped up on a couple of pillows."

Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Wear a knee brace.,
Try wearing arch supporting insoles.,
Include a warm up and cool down in your workouts.",How to Get Rid of Knee Pain from Running2," Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen can help to relieve pain associated with runner’s knee. Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.Ibuprofen can be helpful for joint pain because it is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Ibuprofen can help to reduce some of the inflammation in your knee as well as numb the pain.Talk to your doctor if you are not sure about how much to take.

, A knee brace can help to prevent further knee injury by keeping your knees aligned. Wearing a knee brace may help to protect you against future knee sprains.You can purchase knee braces in sports stores, but you may also have a custom knee brace made for you by an orthotist for a better fit.Your orthotist or doctor can advise you about how long you need to wear the knee brace each day, but you can also see if wearing the brace more often is helpful. You may find that wearing a knee brace at all times is helpful or you may only need to wear it when you are active.Keep in mind that a knee brace alone will not get rid of knee pain. You will need to use a knee brace as part of a rehabilitative plan that includes specific exercises, stretches, and modifications to your running technique., If you have flat feet or high arches, then your knee pain may due to insufficient arch support. You can buy some arch supports for your running shoes in a drug store. If you want to get some professionally made arch supports instead, then you can see a podiatrist for custom insoles or talk to a physical therapist about getting a pair of custom-made orthotics.If you are fitted for custom insoles, then follow your doctor's instructions for how often to wear these. You may need to wear them at all times or just when you are running.

, Warming up and cooling down are important for reducing sports-related injuries. Make sure that all of your workouts include at least a five minute warm-up and cool-down.


To warm up and cool down, do about five to 10 minutes of low intensity exercise. For example, if you are about to go for a run, then warm up with a five minute walk and then cool down with another five minute walk.
You can also include some gentle stretching in your warm ups and cool downs."
"
See a doctor for severe or lingering knee pain.,
Request physical therapy.,
Ask about corticosteroid injections.,
Consider surgery for severe or chronic knee pain.",How to Get Rid of Knee Pain from Running3," If your pain is severe or if it does not improve within two to three days, see your doctor for treatment.Severe or lingering knee pain may be a sign of a serious injury that will not improve without medical treatment.

, A physical therapist can design a stretching and exercising routine to help you recover from your injury.A physical therapist can also work with you to identify your specific challenges.


For example, if you knee pain is due to poor running form, then a physical therapist may be able to help you perfect your running form to prevent future knee injuries and pain.

, Corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief for pain from an injured knee. However, you will need to have repeat injections every few months and this treatment may cause the skin on your knee to become thinner over time.Talk to your doctor to see if this might be a good option for your situation.

, In some cases, surgery may be necessary to get rid of pain from an injured knee. If you have tried everything and your knee does not seem to be improving, then you may want to ask your doctor about your surgical options. These may include:Arthroscopy to remove damaged tissues or bone and cartilage fragments. This is a very common procedure — over four million are preformed worldwide each year.Meniscal tears are a common injury associated with running that often require arthroscopic surgery.
Realignment to fix the angle or alignment of your kneecap. This is done in the case of a more severe injury."

Hydrate.",How to Treat Measles1," As soon as you think that you or someone you know may have measles (see: How to Diagnose Measles), make an appointment with your doctor to receive a proper diagnosis. Describe your symptoms and try to schedule your appointment as soon as possible. Follow any instructions given by the doctor.


These will almost always include a recommendation to stay home and avoid contact with other people. Measles is very contagious, so isolation is key to preventing an outbreak. Read ""Preventing the Disease's Spread"", below, for quarantine strategies.
Be aware that your doctor may ask you to take special precautions when you come to the office, like wearing a mask or using a back entrance, to prevent the spread of measles.The rest of the instructions in this article are not intended to replace the guidance of a doctor or a trained medical professional. When in doubt, always defer to your doctor's advice.;
, Measles is often accompanied with a fever that can peak at 104°F (40°C).Use over the counter (OTC) pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) to help keep your temperature at a manageable level. Follow the directions on the bottle for the correct dosage and timing.


As an added bonus, these pain medicines will also help to relieve the aches and pains associated with the measles virus.

Note: Do not give aspirin to children due to the risk of the deadly Reyes' syndrome, a rare condition that can cause serious conditions in the liver and brain., Almost everyone who gets measles will require plenty of rest to recover. Measles is a serious viral infection that takes much of your body's energy and resources to fight. On top of this, the symptoms of measles can leave you feeling more drained and fatigued than you normally would. Be sure to allow for plenty of sleep and restrict all physical activities while you are sick.


Many sources recommend a week or more of ""time off"" after the rash first develops, especially for children., The facial rash that causes measles can produce conjunctivitis — a condition involving inflamed, watery eyes.This can make people with measles sensitive to light. Use heavy curtains on windows and keep overhead lighting dim when suffering from conjunctivitis to ease your irritated eyes.


While you won't generally want to leave your house when you have measles, if, for some reason, you are forced to, try using a pair of shades to protect your eyes.

, As noted above, the eye condition conjunctivitis often accompanies measles. One of the most noticeable symptoms of conjunctivitis is an increased production of discharge in the eyes. This discharge can cause the eyes to become ""crusty"" or even stuck shut (especially after sleeping.) Remove the crustiness from the eyes by dipping a cotton ball in clean, warm water and wiping from the corner of the eye outward. Use a separate piece of cotton for each eye.


Press very gently when you are cleaning your eyes — since your eyes are already inflamed, they will be extra-sensitive to pain and damage.

, Humidifiers increase the amount of moisture in the air by evaporating water to create vapor. Running a humidifier in the room with you while you are sick will keep the air moist, which can help soothe the sore throat and cough that accompany the measles virus.


If a humidifier is not available, just place a large bowl of water in the room to increase the ambient humidity.
Note that some humidifiers allow you to add a medicated inhalant to the water vapor. If your humidifier lets you do this, pick a cough suppressant, like Vick's.

, Like many illnesses, measles drains your body's supply of moisture faster than it normally would deplete, especially if you have a fever.For this reason, it' very important to stay well-hydrated to keep the body strong enough to fight the infection until you feel better. As a general rule, clear fluids, especially clean, clear water, are best for sick people.

Take the pediatrician's advice, when they tell you that your child should really be taking antibiotics.,
Don't let the fact that your child might have to take their drugs intravenously scare you.,
Realize that surgery may be needed to fix latent problems dealt to the child, if problems persist in their joints.Serious MRSA infections that affect the joints and lungs may require surgery, or intense medication to treat effectively.

,
Take all recommendations asked of you into consideration to prevent the spread of the bacteria.",How to Treat MRSA in Children," If the lab results show that the infection has spread throughout the child's body, the doctor will prescribe a line of antibiotics to tackle it. The child with adult supervision should complete the entire dose to prevent the normally obdurate MRSA bacteria from developing resistant to the drugs.;
, Children with low immunity are particularly susceptible to serious MRSA infections and the infection can become quite nasty and difficult to treat once it reaches the bloodstream or lungs of child. In such cases, doctors usually recommend immediate hospitalization for the kid whereupon they receive a continuous dosage of antibiotics intravenously.

,, Medical practitioners often recommend bleach bathes for serious infections of the skin among children to prevent the bacteria from spreading.

Flat feet in children is normal.,
Tight tendons can cause flat feet.,
Rigid, flat feet are caused by bone deformity.,
Adult-acquired flat feet are often due to obesity.",How to Fix Flat Feet1," It’s normal for kids to have flat feet at least until the age of 5 years (and sometimes as late as 10 years) because it takes time for the bones, ligaments and tendons in the underside of the foot to form a supportive arch.As such, don't panic if your child has flat feet, especially if they don't seem to be causing pain or problems with walking or running — they will likely grow out of it, so no need to seek treatment and try to fix it.


Do the flat surface test to determine flat feet. Moisten your feet and step onto a dry surface that shows your footprint. If the entire surface of your foot can be discerned from the print, then you have flat feet.
A person with normal arches has a crescent of negative space on the inside (medial) part of their footprint due to lack of contact with the surface.
Flat feet in children rarely cause pain.;
, A tight Achilles tendon from birth (congenital) puts too much pressure on the front 3/4 of the foot, preventing a normal springy arch from forming.The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel. When it's too tight it causes the heel to lift off the ground prematurely during each step while walking, causing tension and pain underneath the foot. In this instance, the foot becomes flat while standing, but remains flexible while not weight bearing.


The main treatment options for flexible flat feet with a congenitally short Achilles tendon are either an aggressive regimen of stretching or surgery, which are explained in more detail below.
In addition to arch and heel pain, other common symptoms of flat feet include: calf, knee and/or back pain, swelling around the ankles, trouble standing on tiptoes, difficulty jumping high or running fast.

, A rigid, inflexible flat foot remains without an arch whether weight bearing or not.It's considered a ""true"" flat foot within medicine because the shape of the underneath of the foot remains unchanged at all times, regardless of activity. This type of flat foot is typically caused by bone malformations, deformity or fusions that prevent the arch from forming during childhood.As such, this type of flat foot can be present from birth, or acquired in adulthood due to a foot injury or disease, such as osteoporosis or inflammatory arthritis.


A rigid flat foot often creates more symptoms because the entire biomechanics of the foot are altered.
Rigid flat feet are most resistant to accommodative therapy such as shoe inserts, orthotics and physiotherapy.

, Another kind of flat feet is often referred to as adult-acquired, but it is usually due to overstretching / overuse / damage to the posterior tibial tendon, which runs from the calf muscle along the inside of the ankle and ends within the arch. The tendon is the most important soft tissue of the arch because it provides the most support. The most common cause of posterior tibial tendon overstretching is having to support too much weight (obesity) for too long, particularly if unsupportive footwear are typically worn.


Flat feet is not always bilateral — it can occur in only one foot, especially after suffering a fractured ankle or foot.
Adult-acquired flat feet often respond to accommodative therapy, but losing weight is often the key to fixing the problem.

Lose weight if you're overweight.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Apply ice to acute knee pain.,
Apply moist heat to chronic knee pain.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications.,
Consume more omega-3 fats.,
Take glucosamine and chondroitin supplements.,
See your doctor for prescription medications.,
Consult with your doctor about steroid injections.,
Try acupuncture therapy.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Fix Knee Pain," People who are overweight, particularly the obese, experience more knee pain from increased compression on the joints. The increased pressure wears out the knees with time (arthritis) and also leads to more irritation and injury to ligaments and tendons.In addition, obese people are more likely to develop flat feet and fallen arches, which promotes ""knock knees"" and puts more strain on the outer (lateral) part of the knee joints. As such, losing weight takes pressure off your knee joints and reduces the likelihood of pain.


The safest and most effective way to lose weight is by reducing caloric intake by 500 calories per day can lead to four pounds of lost fat per month.While exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, diet is far important and has a much greater impact when it comes to weight loss.
Slow increase cardiovascular exercise (light walking, stair climber or cycling) while concurrently reducing your intake of calories.;
, Exercise is important for strengthening the muscles around your knees, which act as secondary ""shock absorbers"". Consequently, the stronger the muscles are around your knees (quadriceps, hamstring and calf muscles), the more impact they can absorb.However, not all exercise is beneficial for your knees, especially if you already have knee pain. High-impact exercises such as jogging, running, tennis and stair climbing can cause more knee pain. Thus, stick to basic walking and cycling, either outside or inside your gym.


Gym exercises that increase the strength of your quadriceps (thigh muscles), hamstrings and calves without significantly impacting your knee joints include: mini-squats, leg presses and leg extensions. These exercises should be painless and done with knee flexion — not more than 45 degrees.
Talk to a trainer or physical therapist about isometric knee exercises, such as an assisted knee flexion, which do not require you to move the knee joint.
Switch from high-impact activities to swimming and water aerobics. The buoyancy of the water reduces the stress on your knees, but still works out your leg muscles. Furthermore, swimming is a great way to lose weight.

, If your knee pain is sudden (acute) from trauma and involves inflammation, then using some form of cold therapy (crushed ice, ice cubes, frozen gel packs, veggies from the freezer) is the best approach for reducing pain and swelling.Ice constricts (vasoconstricts) blood vessels close to the skin's surface, which reduces blood flow — important for controlling inflammation. Tearing the ligaments or meniscus (cartilage) of the knee are common acute injuries and typically cause sharp and throbbing pains.


Apply cold therapy to your painful and inflamed knee for between 10–15 minutes or until numb. Start with three to five times per day until the symptoms fade away.
Wrap crushed ice or frozen gel packs in a thin cloth before placing it on your skin — it'll help prevent frostbite and skin irritation.
Place the cold therapy directly over the most painful and inflamed part of your knee(s). Usually that's either the sides or front of the knee joint, which is where the ligaments or tendons are.

, Chronic (long term) knee pain is usually the result of arthritis, particularly the ""wear and tear"" type called osteoarthritis (OA). OA involves dull, achy pain, morning stiffness and often lots of creaking or cracking sounds while walking, but not a lot of swelling.Therefore, applying moist heat is a better idea than ice because the warmth expands (dilates) blood vessels near the knee, improves blood circulation and helps to reduce stiffness. Microwavable herbal bags (filled with bulgur wheat or rice), especially ones infused with relaxing aromatherapy (lavender), are great sources of moist heat for your knees.


Microwave the bags for a few minutes and then apply them first thing in the morning or after long periods of disuse for between 15–20 minutes, three to five times daily. Avoid dry electric sources of heat because it can dehydrate the skin and muscles around your knees.
As an alternative, soak your lower body in a warm Epsom salt bath, which can help reduce knee stiffness and pain. Epsom salt is rich in magnesium.
Heat therapy is likely not beneficial for knee conditions that involve lots of inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout attacks or bursitis.

, Consider taking OTC anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin for short-term relief of acute or chronic knee pain.As an alternative, some OTC painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for mild-to-moderate knee pain caused by arthritis, but they don't impact inflammation.NSAIDs tend to be hard on the stomach and kidneys, so don't rely on them for long periods of time (more than a few weeks). To reduce the risk of stomach irritation, always take NSAIDs with food or on a full stomach.
Painkillers can be hard on the liver, so always follow recommendations on the bottle or from your doctor. Never take painkillers with alcohol.
A safer option (but not always as effective) is applying a cream/gel that contains NSAIDs or acetaminophen to your painful knee.
More natural pain relieving creams often contain menthol or capsaicin, which essentially distract your brain from the knee pain by making the surrounding skin tingle.

, Dietary factors can play a big role in joint pain, especially weight-bearing joints such as the knees. For example, diets high in refined sugars tend to promote joint pain, whereas diets rich in omega-3 fats tend to reduce pain because they have anti-inflammatory effects.Omega-3 fatty acids can be particularly helpful for combating knee pain caused by arthritis.


The main omega-3 fats found in food are abbreviated as ALA, EPA and DHA, although the standard American diet tends to be deficient in these.
Fatty cold water fish, plants and oils made from nuts are the main sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
EPA and DHA are found in salmon, mackerel and tuna, whereas ALA is found in flaxseed oil, canola oil, soy beans, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.As an alternative, supplement with fish oils or seed-based oils to combat your knee pain. Aim for 1,000 mg of omega-3 fats, 2-3X per day.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin are compounds naturally found in all your joints. Glucosamine is needed for joint lubrication, whereas chondroitin is needed for the cartilage to absorb water and be a good shock absorber. Both compounds can be taken as supplements and the research suggests they may help reduce arthritic pain, especially in large weight-bearing joints like the knees.In addition to pain relief, glucosamine also increases knee mobility in mild-to-moderate cases of OA.
Glucosamine sulfate is usually made from shellfish, which can trigger allergies. A safer type may be glucosamine hydrogen, which is made from veggie sources.
To combat knee pain, take about 500 mg of a combined supplement three to four times per day — you can get liquid supplements instead of pills or powder. Remember that it often takes at least two months to get significant results.

, Make an appointment with your doctor so he can diagnose the cause of your knee pain. Your doctor will likely do a physical exam, take x-rays and order blood tests to confirm a diagnosis. If your knee pain is not alleviated by home remedies or OTC medications, then talk to your doctor about getting a stronger prescriptions drug.


COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) are particularly strong NSAIDs that have less risk of stomach problems.They are usually prescribed for OA of the knee.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are typically used to combat the pain and reduce the progression of rheumatoid arthritis by dampening down your immune system.The most common DMARD is methotrexate.

, An corticosteroid injection into the knee can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow for better range of motion.Corticosteroids are hormones that act as strong anti-inflammatories. They are usually injected into joints by orthopedic surgeons under local anesthesia. The most commonly used medications are cortisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone. The effects of the shots are almost always short-term — the pain relief will last from a few weeks to many months typically.


The number of corticosteroid injections you can get is limited to one every three months, because they can cause the knee to deteriorate more quickly.
Potential risks of corticosteroid injections include: infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation/damage.
Corticosteroid injections can be fairly expensive if your health insurance doesn't cover it, so check with your insurance provider.

, Acupuncture is an ancient healing therapy based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine. It involves sticking very fine needles into specific energy points within your skin in efforts to reduce pain, combat inflammation and stimulate healing.Some research indicates that acupuncture can relieve some types of knee pain and improve joint function, particularly in people with OA.Acupuncture is relatively painless and has an excellent safety record, so it may be worth a try if your budget allows it — it isn't usually covered under most health insurance plans.


Acupuncture appears to alleviate pain and inflammation by triggering the release of hormones, such as serotonin, and other compounds called endorphins.
Acupuncture is now practiced by many more types of health professionals, including some medical doctors, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).

, If your knee pain persists after trying a variety of home remedies, medications and alternative treatments, then ask your doctor about the pros and cons of surgery. Surgery should only be considered in severe cases of arthritis and to repair significant damage, such as ruptured ligaments and tendons, torn meniscus and broken bones. There are many types of surgical procedures, including arthroscopic surgery as well as partial and total knee replacements.Arthroscopic surgery involves inserting a small cutting instrument with an attached camera (arthroscope) into the knee joint in order to clean up pieces of torn cartilage and repair ripped ligaments. Recovery time is pretty quick (1-2 weeks), depending on the extent of knee damage.
A synovectomy involves removing the inflamed lining of a knee joint afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis.
An osteotomy involves realigning the bones that form the knee joint — the tibia and femur.
An arthroplasty is total or partial knee replacement surgery. The damaged cartilage/bone is cut out and replaced by an artificial joint made from metal and plastic.

Get a vaccine if you have not had one.,
Quarantine the infected person.,
Keep at-risk people far away from the infected person.,
Use a mask when contact is inevitable.,
See a doctor immediately if you notice serious symptoms.",How to Treat Measles2," By far the quickest and easiest way to prevent the spread of measles is for every person who can safely get the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine to do so. The MMR vaccine is 95-99% effective at preventing infection and almost always gives immunity for life.Healthy people are generally able to receive the vaccine after they are about 15 months old, making vaccination a must for most families.


Like any vaccine, the MMR vaccine can have some side effects, though serious side effects from the measles vaccine are very rare. The measles virus itself is much more dangerous than any of these side effects. The side effects include:Mild fever
Rash
Swelling of lymph nodes
Sore or stiff joints
Very rarely, seizure or allergic reaction.
The MMR vaccine is not known to cause autism — a study from the 1980s that pointed to this possibility has since been discredited., Because the disease is highly contagious, a person with measles should be kept away from other people with very few exceptions. Infected people should not leave the house except for medical emergencies. School and work are out of the question — a single case can disable an entire office for more than a week if allowed to spread. Infected people should stay at home as long as needed to stop being contagious. Since this usually happens about four days after the rash forms, it's wise to plan for a week or more of absence.Be aware that it is unsafe for un-vaccinated people to even be somewhere that a person with measles has been recently. Measles virus can remain in tiny droplets in the air for up to two hours after someone with measles leaves the area., An effective quarantine is extremely important for the safety of certain types of people who are especially vulnerable to the virus. While measles is usually a prolonged inconvenience for healthy people, it can be a serious health risk for these at-risk populations, which include:Children who are too young to get the vaccine
Young children and infants in general
Pregnant women
The elderly
People who have an impaired immune system (due to HIV, etc.)
People suffering from a chronic disease
People suffering from malnutrition (especially vitamin A deficiency)

, As noted above, people with measles should come into contact with other people as little as possible — ideally, not at all. However, in situations where contact can't be avoided (such as when an infected person requires a caretaker or needs to receive emergency medical treatment), wearing a surgical mask can reduce the chance of infection.The infected person, the people s/he is coming into contact with, or both may wear masks.


Masks are somewhat effective because the measles virus transmits itself via tiny droplets of water that are thrown into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.Thus, putting a physical barrier between the lungs of an infected person and the lungs of a healthy person can help prevent infection. However, a mask is not a substitute for proper quarantine.

, As noted above, measles is usually not a serious health threat to healthy people. However, in rare cases (and in cases when measles infects someone with a compromised immune system), the disease can be much more serious — even sometimes lethal: in 2013, over 140,000 people died of measles globally (mostly un-vaccinated children).In the rare event that someone infected with measles begins to exhibit symptoms beyond the ordinary ones described above, rapid medical care is necessary. These include:Severe diarrhea
Serious ear infections
Pneumonia
Impaired vision/blindness
Encephalitis (seizures, confusion, headache, paralysis, hallucination)In general, a rapidly-declining overall physical state that shows no sign of improvement

Wear more supportive shoes.,
Get custom made orthotics.,
Lose weight If you are too heavy.",How to Fix Flat Feet2," Regardless of the type of flat feet you have, wearing shoes with good arch support is going to provide at least some benefit, and it might possibly provide total relief of your foot, leg or back symptoms. Try to find a comfortable walking or athletic shoe with substantial arch support, roomy toe box, firm heel counter and a flexible sole. Supporting your arches helps decrease tension in the posterior tibial and Achilles tendons.


Avoid shoes with heels higher than 2 1/4 inches because it leads to short / tight Achilles tendons. However, wearing completely level shoes is not the answer either, because too much pressure is put on the heel, so wear shoes that are elevated in the heel by about 1/4 or 1/2 inch.
Get fitted for shoes by a trained salesperson later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.

, If you have flexible flat feet (not completely rigid) and spend lots of time standing or walking, then consider a pair of custom made shoe orthotics. Orthotics are semi-rigid shoe inserts that support the arch of your foot and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking and running.By providing cushioning and some shock absorption, orthotics will also help reduce the likelihood of problems developing in other joints such as your ankles, knees, hips and lumbar spine.


Orthotics and similar supports don't reverse any structural deformities of the foot nor can they reconstruct an arch by wearing them over time.
Health professionals who make custom orthotics include podiatrists, as well as some osteopaths, physicians, chiropractors and physiotherapists.
Wearing orthotics often requires taking the factory insoles out.
Some health insurance plans cover customized orthotics, but if yours does not, then consider off-the-shelf orthopedic insoles — they are less expensive and may provide adequate arch support. In fact, they have been shown in some cases to be equally effective when compared to custom orthotics.

, If you are overweight (especially obese), then losing weight has a multitude of health benefits including taking the pressure off the bones, ligaments and tendons of your feet, as well as providing better blood flow to the area.Losing weight won't reverse rigidly flat feet, but it will positively impact other types of flat feet to some extent. For most women, consuming less than 2,000 calories daily will lead to some weekly weight loss even if you're only a mild exerciser. Most men will lose weight on a weekly basis if they consume less than 2,200 calories daily.


Many obese people have flat feet and tend to over-pronate their ankles (the joints collapse and turn in), which then leads to a knock-knee posture.
Sometimes women develop fallen arches during the late stages of pregnancy that then go away once their baby is born.
To help promote weight loss, eat lean meat, poultry and fish, whole grains, fresh veggies and fruit and drink lots of purified water. Avoid sugary drinks such as soda pop.

"
Try some intensive physical therapy.,
Consult a podiatrist.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical options.",How to Fix Flat Feet3," If your flat feet have some flexibility in them (not rigid) and they are caused primarily by weak or tight tendons / ligaments, then you should consider some form of rehabilitation. A physiotherapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your feet, Achilles tendons and calf muscles that can help to restore your arch and make it more functional.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic foot problems.


A common stretch for tight Achilles tendons involves placing your hands against a wall with one leg at a time outstretched behind you in a lunge-like position. Make sure you keep the outstretched foot flat on the floor to feel a stretch above your heels. Hold for about 30 seconds and repeat five to 10 times daily.
A physiotherapist can tape your foot with sturdy tape that can help relieve symptoms by providing a temporary artificial arch.
A physiotherapist can also treat inflamed and tender arches (called plantar fasciitis and a common complication of flat feet) with therapeutic ultrasound.

, A podiatrist is a foot specialist who is familiar with all conditions and diseases of the feet, including pes planus. A podiatrist will examine your foot and try to determine if your flat feet are congenital (hereditary and from birth) or acquired as an adult.They will also look for any bone trauma (fractures or displacements), possibly with the help of x-rays. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the cause of your flat feet, the podiatrist may recommend simple palliative care (rest, ice and anti-inflammatories during flare-ups), orthotic therapy, casting or bracing the foot, or some form of surgery.


Adult-acquired flat feet affects women four times as often as men and tends to occur in later years (around 60).X-rays are great for seeing bone problems, but they are not diagnostic for soft tissue issues, such as those of the tendons and ligaments.
Your podiatrist is trained for relatively minor operations of the feet, but more complex surgeries are typically the domain of orthopedic surgeons.

, If your flat feet are causing you lots of problems and not significantly helped by supportive shoes, orthotics, weight loss or intensive physical therapy, then ask your family physician about potential surgical options. Your doctor may use a CT scan, MRI or diagnostic ultrasound to get a better idea of the soft tissues of your foot. For severe cases of highly rigid flat feet, especially if caused by tarsal coalition (an abnormal fusion of two or more bones in the foot), then surgery recommendation is highly likely.Surgery is also recommended for chronically tight Achilles tendons (typically a simple procedure to lengthen the tendon) or overly lax posterior tibial tendons (via tendon reduction or shortening). Your family doctor is not a foot, bone or joint specialist, so you will likely be referred to an orthopedic surgeon if surgery is required.


Surgeons typically operate on one foot at a time so as not to incapacitate the patient and impact their lives too significantly.
Possible complications from surgery include: failure of fused bones to heal, infections, reduced ankle / foot range of motion, chronic pain.Recovery times for surgery vary depending on the procedure (whether bones need to be broken or fused, tendons severed, or ligaments altered), but can last several months.
Diseases that are contributive factors for flat feet include diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ligament laxity diseases such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes."

This can cause the pain to be slightly different depending on exactly where the heel spur is. They can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, near the sole of your foot. If you are experiencing pain along the back of your foot, up through your ankle, you might have a heel spur on the back of your heel.


If the pain you feel is localized on the sole of your foot and main curve of your heel, you may have a heel spur on the underside of your heel.;
, If you are experiencing heel pain, you should take note of when the pain is the worst. Most of the pain associated with heel spurs is worse first thing in the morning, with the first few steps you take in the morning being the most painful. There will also likely be pain when you step on your heel again after long periods of rest.


Your heel pain may also get worse if you put a lot of pressure on your foot throughout the day. Any prolonged irritation of the spur can cause pain., The main symptom of heel spurs is prolonged pain. Often, a doctor will base her diagnosis on a history of pain in your foot by the heel. You should keep a log of how often you experience pain in your heels and under what circumstances the pain exhibits itself.


The kind of pain the doctor will be looking for is any general pain or tenderness at the bottom of your heel, especially when you walk barefoot across tile or wood floors., If you have heel spurs on the upper portion of your heel, the pain you experience isn't actually directly caused by the spur. The bony outgrowth rarely causes pain on its own, but the tissue will build up calluses on them to help cushion the spurs. These will eventually cause wear and tear on the joints, which can cause the spurs to compress the neighboring tendons, nerves, or ligaments.


This is what causes injury as well as tearing, pain, and swelling.The muscle that will likely be most affected with this type of heel spur is the Achilles tendon. The spurs will cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel, where the Achilles tendon is, which is made worse when you push off on the ball of your foot., If your spur is on the bottom of your foot, along the plantar fascia, the pain is typically caused by the spur moving against the plantar fascia. This causes local tenderness due to inflammation and swelling.


The pain is typically made worse when you stand or walk on the area for too long., Heel spurs can be caused by a few separate issues relating to the muscles, ligaments, and tendons in your feet. Often, heel spurs occur when there is extended strain on the foot's muscles and ligaments. This strain is often associated with repeated activities, such as running, extensive walking on feet unaccustomed to the exercise, and repeated jumping. They can also be caused by improper fitting or worn out shoes.


The exact cause may be slightly hard to pinpoint because the pain related to the heel spurs may take a while to manifest after the activity that finally causes the pain. Try to keep track of when your pain occurs so you can try to link it with the probable cause., Individuals most at risk for heel spurs are those that put a lot of stress on their feet. People who take part in a lot of sporting events or athletic activities that put repetitive pressure on the feet are likely at risk. You may also be at risk if you are pregnant, obese, or have diabetes.Individuals who work in a job where they spend a lot of time on their feet, such as construction workers, nurses, waitresses, or factory workers, may also be at risk due to the daily strain on their feet across hard surfaces.


For example, people who run a lot, play tennis, or play volleyball are at risk for heel spurs. Individuals who do a lot of step aerobics or climbing exercises are also at risk.
If you wear ill-fitting high heels on a regular basis, you may also be at risk for heel spurs., If you are experiencing chronic pain in your heels, you need to see your doctor. If you have a podiatrist, you can go see her first. However, if you only have a general doctor, she can do a preliminary examination and refer you to a good podiatrist that will be able to help with your spurs. Your podiatrist will likely ask for a history of any past foot ailments, any stress factors that may have contributed to the spurs, and the state of the shoes you wear on a normal basis.


She will feel along your injured foot for any abnormalities and try to replicate the pain you feel in order to diagnose it. She will also likely check the range of motion of your foot and ankle as well as assess the way you walk.
You should explain to your doctor exactly the kind of pain you feel, when you feel it, and what parts of your foot the pain effects.

, If you podiatrist suspects that you have heel spurs, she may x-ray your foot to see what is going on. Since spurs occur on a bony outgrowth on your foot, they will show up on the x-ray in a very similar way to the bones in your feet. Your podiatrist will understand the difference between the spurs and normal bony areas of your foot.The kind of heel spurs that typically show up on x-rays have most likely been growing on your foot for at least six months and extend out of your foot about 1/2 an inch.


The doctor may also find other heel spurs or bone spurs that are not giving you pain. Not all spurs cause pain, just ones that have been around long enough to cause inflammation or create calluses.

, When you first start experiencing pain in your heel, you should rest the area. To do this, you should cut out any activity that puts unnecessary stress on your heels and you plantar fascia. This means you need to stop any exercise or physical activity, such as running, long distance walking, or jumping, that might irritate the tissues in your foot.


Resting for a few days usually is enough to make the pain go away, but if there is continual pain, other options might be necessary.

, If your foot in continually inflamed or irritating you, you can try to alleviate the swelling and pain with a cold compress or ice. Grab a cold compress from your freezer and a towel or cloth. Wrap the cold compress in the towel. Place the cold compress against your heel, concentrating the bulk of the compress on the area that hurts the most. Leave the compress on for 15 minutes.


You can also use ice or ice water on your heel. Just make sure you don't expose your skin to the cold for too long so you don't hurt or burn your skin.
You can repeat this multiple times a day. Try not to leave it on for more than 15-30 minutes. You don't want to stop the blood flow to your heel too much or you might injure yourself more.
Ice is especially helpful after your heels are sore from walking or other activities.

, Although it will not treat the overall cause of the heel spur, you can take over the counter medication to help you deal with the pain from your spur. You can take acetaminophen or aspirin to help relieve the pain you have while you rest your foot. You can also try medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which will also help with the swelling and inflammation. The two most popular NSAIDs are ibuprofen or naproxen.


Common brands of NSAIDs are Advil, Motrin, and Aleve. Popular non anti-inflammatory drugs are Tylenol and Bayer., One way that podiatrist often treat heel spur pain is by giving you inserts to wear in your shoes. This can be simple heel cups to cushion and protect your heel.She may also give you more advanced orthotics, which are inserts worn inside your shoes to correct mechanical motion problems with your feet that led to your spurs. These take the pressure off of your heels and help change the way you walk.


Your doctor may also suggest you tape your heel to provide pressure and cushioning for your heel.

, You can change the type of shoe that you wear in order to help alleviate the pain associated with heel spurs. This includes shoes that are more comfortable, shoes with better arch and heel support, shoes with higher heels to take the pressure off your heels, and significantly cushioned running shoes.


The type of shoe that you need will depend on the problem you have with your feet. It will vary and may take multiple kinds of shoes, depending on what you common activities are.

, Your doctor or podiatrist may recommend exercises that stretch your calf muscles, which may provide relief from foot pain.Try a calf stretch. Place both hands flat against a wall and stand with one leg stretched straight behind you, heel on the ground. Place the other leg in front, knee bent. Stretch the calf muscle by pushing your hips toward the wall and hold for ten seconds, then relax. You should feel a strong pull in the calf muscle. Repeat this exercise 20 times per foot."

Try over the counter pain relievers.,
Consider buying new shoes.,
See a podiatrist to get special orthotic inserts.,
Talk to a doctor about surgical options.",How to Deal With Morton's Toe," If you have Morton's Toe, your second toe will likely be longer than your big toe.A normal foot shape is defined by a big toe that is longer than the rest, with toes 2-5 decreasing in length.
You might have Morton's toe even if your second toe isn't longer than your big toe.
You should always see a medical professional to diagnose this condition and to discuss treatment options.;
, Morton's Toe can cause debilitating pain and long term complications.Morton's toe causes surrounding bones to be displaced, putting unnecessary weight on the head of the second foot bone.
This extra weight bearing causes stress to the bone.
This extra weight causes a callus to form underneath the bone. A callus is a hard swelling of bone.
This callus can cause moderate to severe pain in the foot.
Some people with Morton's Toe have debilitating pain. This can be a strong, aching constant pain or a sharp pain during walking.

, This condition can lead to further problems down the road. Patients with Morton's Toe can have lower back pain, knee pain, and hip pain. This is due to slight changes in the way you walk when you have Morton's Toe.
Arthritis is a common problem in people with this condition.
This condition can also lead to bunions and hammer toes.

, These may initially reduce pain and provide temporary relief.These are not a long term solution to this problem.
Over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and aspirin can help to reduce pain and inflammation.
Other simple interventions can include keeping weight off of your foot and applying ice to reduce inflammation.
These should not be used long-term. If you are experiencing severe, chronic pain you should see a doctor.

, New shoes with the right shape and comfort level can help to relieve symptoms.Purchase shoes with wider toe boxes. This extra room will provide some relief.
Make sure your shoes have enough cushioning.
Avoid shoes that pinch toes or high heels while treating this condition.

, This is often the only treatment needed for this conditions.This consists of putting a flexible pad under the metatarsal and toe in your shoe.
This pad cushions the area.
This changes the weight bearing on the toe and increases range of motion in the foot.

, Only do this if all other treatments haven't worked.Surgery is invasive and there are always risks so it is best to try all other options before resulting to surgery.
Surgery can be done to remove a small section of the bone to decrease the length of the second toe and relieve extra weight bearing.
Bone shortening is the most common type of surgery for this condition.
Other bones in the foot can be lengthened with silicone inserts by a surgeon.
Bone lengthening is not as common as other surgical methods. This type of surgery is more invasive and has more risk for complications.

Raise, point and curl your toes.",How to Exercise Toes1," Place your feet flat on the floor and try to lift each toe one by one. This may be difficult at first but try and lift each toe multiple times in a row at least once a day.This is an effective exercise for making the toes stronger and more flexible.
, While barefoot, take a few steps across the room lightly while only on your toes. This will give you a challenge in balance and also let you gauge how strong your toes really are.Use a slanted board for a more challenging toe lift exercise. Take an already slanted exercise board or put an object against a flat board to make it slanted (books, wood blocks). With the board against a door frame so you can lean slightly forward, step onto the board and rise up onto your tippitoes and then back down to your feet., While standing, first raise yourself onto the front of your feet. Stand on your tippitoes on one foot and slowly curl the toes under. Maintain balance with the opposite foot planted firmly on the ground. Hold each position for five seconds and repeat with the other foot.If curling the toes is too difficult, lift up to the balls of your feet and stay there for five seconds. Continue to lift to your toes if you feel comfortable.

If you toenail is already short, then wait a few days before attempting to cut it. You can care for the pain by soaking your feet and using a topical pain medicine.


Keep in mind that your toenail should extend past the skin under your toenail.;
, Soaking your feet in warm water will help to soften the nail and make it easier to cut. Soaking your feet may also help to reduce some of the pain caused by the ingrown toenail.Try adding a couple tablespoons of Epsom salt to the warm water. The Epsom salt may help to relieve some of the pain caused by the ingrown toenail.

, In some cases, it is not necessary to cut the nail because it is already quite short. If your toenail does not extend beyond the skin on the end of your toe, then you may only need to file it.


When you file your nail, make sure that you file it straight across. Filing your nail on a curve or at an angle may lead to a worsening of your ingrown toenail.

, If your nail extends past the edge of your toe, then you probably need to cut it. Make sure that you cut your toenail straight across. Cutting nails on a curve or at an angle is one of the causes of ingrown toenails, so it is important to cut your nails straight across.Do not cut the nail too short because this can also lead to ingrown toenails.
Avoid cutting or digging at the corners of your toenails as well. This can make an ingrown toenail worse.

, Never try to rip or pull out an ingrown toenail with tweezers, scissors, or any other tools.These tools are likely to break the skin and this may cause an infection as well.

Wriggle your toes.,
Stretch your foot with an exercise band.,
Do 20 squats.",How to Exercise Toes2," This easy stretch can be done at anytime and requires very little thought. The wriggling will loosen the toes out and stop the them from being sore, especially after a hard workout., Sit down and take a flat exercise band that is secured to a fixed spot and put it around your foot, right below the toes. Sitting with that leg extended, pull your foot towards your shin until you feel the tension of the band. Repeat this for each foot.Move your body backwards while keeping your foot pointing up towards the ceiling for a more challenging exercise., This is a simple exercise in which you plant your feet and squat your body down like you are sitting on an invisible chair. This exercise will not just help your toes, but also stretch the feet and the legs, and it a perfect workout for someone who does a lot of jumping or running."

Take 20 marbles and see if you can drop them into a bowl one at a time for an added workout., Place the towel at your feet and slowly curl it towards you by only using your toes. Repeat this five times for both feet. If you would like to increase the resistance of the towel add some weight to the end of it., Find some rocks (make sure they are not sharp or jagged) that you can walk on comfortably. Your feet will grip the rocks naturally and the changing surface of the rocks will work out the nerves in the feet that actually connect to the lower back, strengthening both."

Consider making an appointment with a podiatrist.,
Watch for symptoms of an infection.",How to Cut an Ingrown Toenail2," If your ingrown toenail is causing you pain, then consider picking up some topical pain reliving cream to put on the area. Keep in mind that these creams will not heal your ingrown toenail, but they should make your ingrown toenail a little more bearable., If your ingrown toenail is painful, then using a cold compress may also help to soothe the pain. Try wrapping an ice pack in a towel and holding it on your ingrown toenail for about five to 10 minutes.


Make sure that you do not hold the ice pack on your toe for too long or you may cause tissue damage and frostbite. Allow your skin to return to its normal temperature before reapplying the ice pack.

, Cutting an ingrown toenail yourself can be difficult and painful. Ingrown toenails can go deep into your skin and cutting an ingrown toenail may lead to pain, cause an infection, or make the ingrown toenail worse. Consider seeing a podiatrist to cut your ingrown toenail rather than trying to do it on your own.A podiatrist can provide medication to numb the area before doing anything to it.

Place your foot flat on the paper.If you intend to wear socks with the shoe you're buying, wear those socks while measuring your foot.;
, With a pen or pencil, trace the outline of your foot. Keep the pen or pencil as close to your foot as possible. This will help ensure an accurate measurement.You'll get the most accurate measurement if you have someone else trace your foot while you remain seated upright, but it's okay to do it yourself.

, After you finish measuring your first foot, do the exact same process with the second foot. Feet are usually slightly different in size, so you'll be picking shoes with your larger foot in mind., Identify the areas on your feet with the largest width. Take a tape measure or ruler to measure both widths., The first measurements will not be entirely accurate. The pencil will have created a small amount of space, making your measurements slightly larger than your actual feet. To determine your most accurate foot width, subtract 5 millimeters or 1/5 of an inch from each measurement., Shoe width varies by shoe size. To determine shoe width, measure the distance between the longest part of each foot. Then, subtract 5 millimeters or 1/5 of an inch., With a simple internet search, you can find a general size chart for shoe size. Match the length of your foot with the corresponding shoe size. But also take note that there are different size charts based on gender.For example, a foot around 8.5 (21.6 centimeters) inches would be a size 5 in women's based on US sizes. In European countries, the measurement 8.5 would be a a 35 or 36.

, The size chart should indicate your width based on your shoe size. After identifying your shoe size, look back to the width measurements of your bigger foot. Figure out what the width would be for your shoe size based on that measurement.For example, a woman with size 5 shoes with a shoe width around four inches (10.16 centimeters) would require an extra wide shoe. In stores, extra wide shoes are normally labeled as ""E.""

, Every sizing chart is different and some company's shoes may run slightly smaller or larger than average. When buying shoes, see if the manufacturer has a specific sizing chart before assuming your shoe size based on a general chart. This will help increase the likelihood shoes will fit properly, especially if you're making purchases online., The size of your feet fluctuate throughout the day. Feet tend to get bigger at night due to swelling. Measure your feet at night to make sure your shoe will fit throughout the course of a day., If you're going to typically wear socks with your shoes, put your socks on before measuring your feet. For example, running or gym shoes are typically worn with socks, so put on your normal workout socks when measuring your feet.Some shoes, like sandals and some flats, usually are not worn with socks. In this case, it's unnecessary to wear socks while measuring your shoes.

, Shoe size and width can help you find shoes with a higher chance of fitting. However, even if the measurements are correct, things like the shape of your feet can affect how a shoe fits. It's always better to try shoes on prior to purchase.If you do order shoes online, make sure it's from a company that allows you to return them for a full refund if they don't fit.

, One foot is usually a little bigger than the other. Use this foot's measurements to determine your shoe's widths. This way, your shoes will fit comfortably on both feet."

Prop your knee so it is at least 12 inches above your heart.,
Keep a 45-degree angle between your thigh and the couch or bed.,
Repeat the process several times daily.,
Apply ice to relieve any discomfort.",How to Elevate Your Knee1," Change out of any constricting garments, such as skinny jeans, before elevating your knee. Tight clothes can reduce blood flow to the area. Put on comfortable, loose fitting clothes, such as sweatpants, a skirt or athletic shorts., Lie on your back on a wide couch or in bed with plenty of room. You can place a pillow behind your head or shoulders to make yourself more comfortable, if you like. Make sure to have some propping pillows for your knee within arm’s reach.Avoid lying flat on your back if you are more than 3 months pregnant. Lying flat late in pregnancy can cause your uterus to compress a major artery in your body, which can decrease circulation. Place a few pillows behind your back and shoulders so you’re propped up at a 45-degree angle instead., Place a few pillows underneath your heel and calf to raise your knee until it is about 12 inches (30 cm) above your heart. Avoid putting pillows directly underneath the knee, which can apply pressure to any swelling and limit your range of motion. Use as many pillows as necessary to achieve the right elevation.It may be helpful to have a partner or friend place the pillows for you. This way you don’t have to exert yourself if you’re in any pain.
If you don’t feel confident about arranging your own pillows or don’t have enough to achieve the right elevation, many online retailers sell special knee-elevation pillows to hold your leg at just the right angle. Especially if you are injured or having trouble arranging multiple pillows yourself, this might be a good alternative.

, After arranging the pillows, check the angle between your thigh and the surface you are lying on. A 45-degree angle—halfway between lying flat and having your legs vertical—is best for good blood flow., Rest and elevate your knees 3 to 4 times a day for 15 minutes at a time. Use your elevations as a moment to relax, check your email, or watch a show. Elevating your knee for this amount of time will help increase blood flow and reduce any pain. It is not helpful to do elevations for a longer period of time, unless your doctor tells you to do so., Use an ice pack wrapped in a tea towel to ice your elevated knee for up to ten minutes at a time. Don’t ice more frequently than once an hour, though.Icing can reduce puffiness and ease any pain you’re experiencing. To protect yourself, always use a barrier, such as a towel or T-shirt, between the ice and your bare skin.If your pain makes you want to ice the knee more frequently, schedule a check up with your doctor to rule out a more serious knee injury.

Apply some ice afterwards.,

Stretch your lower leg muscles.,
Strengthen muscles associated with shin splints.",How to Do a Myofascial Release Self Massage for Shinsplints," Shin splint pain is often deep and achy, and generated from the outside (lateral) mid-part of your tibialis anterior muscle, the main muscle next to your shinbone. Sometimes the tibial periosteum (the thin sheath of tissue that wraps around the shinbone) is also inflamed and painful. Typically, only one leg is involved and it's usually your most dominant one — the one you'd kick a ball with.Feel around the mid-section of the muscle next to your shinbone for pain or tenderness. A shin splint is usually most tender roughly half-way between your knee and ankle joints.
Be aware that you may come into contact with a trigger point, or more commonly known as a muscle knot. Pressing on a trigger point can lead to local tenderness, referred pain and a ""twitch"" response. Referred pain can sometimes be felt into the big toe when pressing into this area.Typically there's only one tender and inflamed area, but you may find a couple different ones.
Once you've identified the area, you'll know where to focus on with the myofascial release technique.;
, Myofascial release is a deep tissue massage technique usually done with a firm foam roller or small ball, such as a tennis ball. The technique focuses on relieving pain thought to arise from the myofascia, which are the tough membranes that wrap, connect and support your muscles.The membranous junctions are a little deeper under the skin, so myofascial release requires firm pressure to be able to impact them.


Select a firm piece of foam roll, between 2–4 inches in diameter. It doesn't need to be any longer than 6 inches. The long ones are commonly used for yoga and are widely available in sporting good stores.
Select the firmest type of tennis ball you can. Some hard rubber balls might be effective also, but make sure they're not much bigger than a tennis ball. Try a lacrosse ball.
Professional massage therapists, chiropractors and physical therapists often use their thumbs or elbows to do myofascial release, but for self-treatment, foam rollers and tennis balls are more convenient and prevent a potential thumb sprain.

, Find a firm carpeted surface (or you can lay a yoga mat down on wood or tile floors) and descend to your hands and knees. You could sit in a chair and push the foam roller or tennis ball into your sore shin muscles, but working with gravity and using your body weight is easier. The idea is to roll your shin over the foam/ball, instead of rolling the foam/ball over your leg.


A hard tiled or wood floor is fine to use, but if may cause some discomfort in your knees as you kneel on it. Any padding you use is for the comfort of your knees, not effectiveness of the treatment.
Before you kneel down, change into something that exposes your lower leg below your knee, such as a pair of shorts or Capri pants.

, Once you're on your hands and knees, bend the sore leg with the shinsplints at the hip and knee and position the front of your shin onto your foam roller or tennis ball, which should be lying on the floor. For best balance, extend your other leg behind your (with your toes on the floor) and place both hands about 1–2 feet away from your bent knee and slightly ahead of it.


In this position, you're initially supporting your body weight with your arms, but then once balanced, let your entire body weight push against the roller or ball.
Once your entire body weight is balanced over the roller/ball, only your fingertips and toes of your other leg should be touching the floor.
Wear some flexible rubber-soled shoes for best support and traction on the floor.

, As your entire body weight is balanced over the roller/ball, rock yourself back and forth so that you can feel sustained pressure over the sore area of your shin. Any type of deep tissue massage, including myofascial release, can be a little painful, but this is where the old adage ""no pain, no gain"" applies. The focused, continual pressure and stretching caused by this therapy loosens up restricted and tight fascia and other tissues, which often leads indirectly to reduced pain and increased mobility in the muscle fibers.Use your finger tips and toes to rock your body back and forth over the foam roller or tennis ball — maybe a little side-to-side motion will help too. If you find that the motion is too painful, move away to an area that is less tender and hold that position for 30 to 60 seconds. Then slowly edge your way to the area of pain.
Keep the pressure over the roller or ball for about three minutes at a time, then take a five minute break and continue a few more times. Follow this routine on a daily basis.
Deep tissue massage can release inflammatory by-products and lactic acid into your bloodstream, so always drink plenty of water immediately following any self-treatment to flush them out of your body.

, After the myofascial self-treatment, which may take upwards of 20 minutes, put some crushed ice or something cold over your tender shin muscles for about 10–15 minutes.Ice therapy is great for numbing musculoskeletal pain and reducing inflammation because it restricts local blood flow. If you don't have crushed ice, consider using ice cubes, a cold gel pack or a small bag of frozen veggies from the freezer. You can also freeze water in a paper cup, then peel off the paper around the lip of the cup and roll/slide the ice over your shins.


To protect your skin from frostbite or irritation, always wrap ice in a thin towel or cloth before applying it.
Wrap the ice therapy tightly against your shin with a tensor bandage for best results.
Without combating the inflammation and tenderness with ice therapy each time, you may find the following day's myofascial session too difficult to do because of pain.

, Shinsplints are often caused by either running (or walking) too much up hills, or on uneven terrain, or on particularly hard surfaces — such as asphalt or concrete.Therefore, alter your course and change the type of surface you run or walk on a regulate basis (every week). For example, switch sometimes to more forgiving terrain, such as grass, sand or a rubberized athletic track.


If you run on a track, don't always run in the same direction. This can put an imbalance of forces on your lower legs. Make sure you change the direction in which you run on a regular basis.
Alternatively, you might also need to reduce your mileage and the number of times you workout per week.
Consider cross training. Mix in entirely different exercises in order to stay fit, but reduce the strain on your shin muscles.
Swimming, cycling and rowing are good alternatives and also great at burning calories and maintaining a healthy weight.

, Losing weight (if you're heavy) can help prevent shinsplints from developing because you'll put less pressure on the bones and muscles of your lower legs when walking and running.Weight loss is best achieved by a combination of regular exercise and eating sensibly (consuming less calories). For most overweight women, consuming less than 2,000 calories per day will lead to 1–2 pounds every week even if you're only a light exerciser. Most heavy men will lose a similar amount of weight at under 2,200 calories daily.Focus on better nutrition. Switch to lean meats and fish, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fresh fruits and veggies and lots of water for the results. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks, particularly soda pop.
Many overweight and obese people get flat feet and tend to over-pronate their ankles (they collapse and roll in), which are significant risk factors for developing shinsplints.

, Poorly fitting shoes or ones that are really heavy can also trigger the development of shinsplints. The tibialis anterior muscles work to raise your toes while walking, so if your shoes don't fit or are heavy, they muscles can get strained. Therefore, wear stable, supportive lightweight shoes that suit your sport or activity. Aim for no more than a 1/2 inch heel. If you're a serious jogger, replace your running shoes every 350 to 500 miles or after three months, whichever comes first.Get fitted by a shoe salesman later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.Get an evaluation done at a reputable running store if you're a serious jogger. You may be asked to run over a force plate that's hooked up to a computer, or get video taped while you're running as part of the assessment.
Remember to tie your footwear tightly, because loose shoes or flip-flops put more strain / stress on your foot and lower leg muscles.
If you are an over-pronator, look into getting supports (orthotics) for the soles of your shoes.

, Stretching muscles of your lower leg (both front and back) can help prevent shinsplints. If you have shin pain, gently stretch your calves (and Achilles tendons) by wrapping a towel around your toes and then trying to slowly extend your leg while holding on to the ends of the towel. In addition, gently stretch the tibialis anterior muscle by kneeling on a padded floor with your feet together and toes pointed back, then slowly sit back onto your calves until you feel tension in the muscles of your shin.


Hold each type of stretch for 20–30 seconds at a time, then relax and repeat three to five times per day or as needed.Alternatively, while in a sitting position with your sore leg in the air, try tracing the letters of the alphabet with your toes. This is a good exercise that stretches and loosens up all the muscles of your lower leg.
Focus on these stretches before running, jogging or going for long walks. It will help warm up the muscles and prevent shinsplints from flaring up.

, The best strengthening exercises to perform when you have shin splints is calf raises and hip abductor strengthening. Research has shown that these are the most effective strengthening exercises for shin splints and preventing shin splints."

Prop up your back and neck with a pillow or two if it makes you feel more comfortable.Avoid lying flat on your back if you are pregnant and past the first trimester. Your uterus can put too much pressure on a central artery, actually suppressing blood flow, which is the opposite of what you want to do. Place a couple of pillows behind your back so you are propped up at a 45-degree angle., Place pillows underneath your feet and ankles to elevate them. Stack as many as necessary to elevate your feet to the level of your heart. Raising your feet to heart level will help drain pooled blood from your feet and make it easier for your heart to increase circulation.You may be most comfortable putting a pillow or two underneath your calves as well to support your elevated feet.

, The number of minutes you perform at a given elevation session doesn’t matter as much as the total time.

If you cannot fully bend or flex the knee, or doing so causes you pain, you should call your doctor for an examination., Holding onto a chair for support, gently bear a little weight by standing on the leg with the swollen knee. If it’s too painful to do or you feel your knee cannot support your weight, sit down right away. Call your doctor, who can advise if you should go to your local urgent care facility., Close your eyes and focus on your pain level. While some mild discomfort is to be expected with swelling, if your pain registers as more than a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, it may imply a more serious injury. Make an appointment with your doctor to have the knee examined., Place a thermometer underneath your tongue to check your temperature. If the final reading is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher, you have a fever, which could be a sign of infection. You should make an appointment to rule out anything more serious than routine knee swelling."
"
Rest your knee for the first 48 hours after injury.,
Ice your knee for two to three days following the injury.,
Compress your knee using a bandage.,
Elevate your knee above heart level.,
Avoid heat for the first 72 hours following the injury.,
Stay away from alcoholic drinks.,
Do not run on your sprained knee.,
Don’t massage the knee until 72 hours have passed.",How to Deal with a Knee Sprain1," Rest is the first and most important measure for knee sprain. Rest will not only decrease pain but can also prevent further injury to the knee. Consider the use of crutches to keep the weight off your injured knee. However, many doctors say that you should actually not keep your injured knee immobile for too long. You can usually start some exercises to help keep your knee joint moving and mobile. Start these as soon as you can tolerate the exercises without them causing too much pain. Talk to your doctor when you are considering starting exercises.
Your doctor may advise you to wear a knee brace to keep your knee immobile for few days until the ligaments heal.;
, Ice application is an effective way of reducing pain and swelling caused by a knee sprain. Ice mainly acts by cooling down that area, which can help to reduce blood flow and inflammation.Do not apply ice directly to the affected knee. Instead wrap it in a plastic bag or cloth and then apply it over the affected knee for 15 to 20 minutes every 4 hours.

, Compression will reduce swelling and pain. Compression will physically reduce the swelling and enhance blood drainage from that area.Using an elastic bandage, wrap the knee starting from below the knee, and extend the bandage up past the top of the knee. The wrap should not be too tight; otherwise it will cut off circulation to the leg and ankle.
Re-wrap the if bandage if it is too tight. Remove the bandage before going to sleep.

, Knee elevation will reduce swelling around the joint. This is because when your knee is elevated above your heart, it speeds up the blood drainage in that area. This, in turn, will limit the swelling in that area.Use a pillow to elevate your knee while you are sleeping.

, Hot baths, saunas, and heat packs should be avoided for 72 hours. Heat has the opposite effect of ice when it comes to blood flow; it actually encourages blood flow rather than slowing it down.However, after 72 hours, no further inflammation is likely to develop and heat may then be soothing to your painful knee.

, Alcoholic drinks can increase bleeding and swelling and decrease healing, so alcohol should be avoided for first 72 hours after a knee sprain occurs., Running may cause further damage. Try walking after two to three days. Stop walking if you feel pain.

, A massage may be soothing after 72 hours when inflammation has subsided. However, if you massage your knee before 72 hours has passed, it could increase blood flow to the area and cause swelling."

Ask for help.",How to Deal With a Dislocated Knee," Depending on how badly dislocated your knee is or if you are in significant pain, you may need to call emergency services or get to a local hospital. Evaluating the status of your knee before deciding on the right treatment can prevent further injury and minimize discomfort.


You may have a dislocated knee if your knee appears deformed or different than it normally does.Other signs your knee may be dislocated are: you cannot straighten out a bent knee, your kneecap dislocates to the outside of your knee, you have pain and tenderness in the area, there is swelling around your knee, you can move your kneecap far to each side of your knee.You may also have trouble walking.;
, If you are able and it is not too painful, try and straighten out your knee.If your knee is stuck or too painful to straighten out, stabilize it and get medical attention as soon as possible., If your knee is deformed or painful, avoid moving the joint. You also shouldn’t force it into place. This may cause further injury to your surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels., It is very important to stabilize your knee to prevent further damage. Place a splint behind and around your knee until you can get medical attention.Make a splint using a variety of items including rolled up newspaper or towels. Apply surgical tape around your leg to keep the splints in place.Having padding on your splint may minimize pain., Place an ice pack on your knee after you splint it. This can minimize pain and swelling by controlling internal bleeding and the pooling of fluids around the injured joint.Avoid applying the ice directly to the joint to prevent frostbite. Wrap your knee or the joint in some kind of cloth or towel to reduce your risk of frostbite.

, Your doctor or local hospital can decide on the best treatment for your knee, which will likely include realigning your joint.Depending on the severity of the dislocation, you may need a splint, cast, surgery, or rehabilitation.Your doctor may ask questions about how the dislocation happened, how painful the injury is, and if you’ve had a dislocated knee in the past.
You may need an x-ray or MRI to help determine the severity of your dislocation and the best course of treatment., Once your doctor examines you, she may suggest several different types of treatment.You may undergo:


Reduction, which requires that your doctor gently maneuver your knee back into place. If you are in a lot of pain, she may give you a local or general anesthetic.Immobilization, which requires a splint or sling to keep your knee from moving around too much. How long you wear the splint depends on how much damage the dislocation caused.Surgery, which may be necessary if your doctor can’t realign your knee, the surrounding tissue is damaged, or you have frequent dislocations.Rehabilitation, which can help you regain motor strength after your splint is removed., Give your leg a chance to rest every day. Immobility can help you heal properly and minimize pain or discomfort.Wiggle your toes and lower leg if it doesn’t cause too much pain to prevent stiff joints., Apply an ice pack to your leg throughout the day for the first two to three days. The ice can reduce inflammation and pain and promote healing.Use ice as often as necessary for 15–20 minutes at a time.Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your skin from the cold.
If the ice is too cold or your skin numbs, take it off., After two to three days, place heat on your knee. This helps relax tightened muscles and ligaments and helps your knee heal.Apply heat for 20 minutes at a time.Remove heat if it gets too hot or hurts. You should have a towel or cloth as a barrier between your skin and the heat source.
Use heating blankets or patches to heat your knee.

, You may have pain and discomfort with your dislocation. Take a pain reliever to reduce discomfort and help you relax.Take over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium can reduce inflammation.If you are in a lot of pain, ask your doctor to prescribe a pain reliever with a narcotic.

, Giving your leg and knee a chance to rest can help the healing process. Avoid excessive movement and favor doing gentle movements to get blood flowing and prevent stiff joints.Start by wiggling your toes and moving your leg gently back and forth and then side to side.
Stretch your quads by lying on your stomach and bending your leg back to grasp your ankle. Gently pull your heel toward your butt.Hold this position as long as you can and gradually increase your time.
Stretch your hamstrings by lying on your back with a belt or towel looped over the ball of your foot.Straighten your leg and slowly pull the belt to raise your leg while keeping the opposite leg on the floor. Keep raising your leg until you feel a gentle stretch. Hold it for as long as you can and gradually increase your time.Ask your doctor if there are any movements or light exercises you can do to promote healing and avoid stiffness.

, Your doctor may suggest rehabilitation or physical therapy once your sling or splint is removed.Attend rehabilitation sessions until you receive the OK from your physical therapist.


Attend rehabilitation under the direction of your doctor or another medical professional. Ask your doctor to suggest a physical therapist.
Early rehabilitation could include simple movements that help promote blood flow and prevent stiffness in your knee.Physical therapy may help you regain muscle strength, joint motion, and flexibility., Wait a few weeks to return to your normal activities. You may also want to wait until your doctor approves returning your usual routine.Depending on the severity of your dislocation and the treatment, you may be on crutches or in a wheelchair. Ask your doctor if you are able to drive or even sit for prolonged periods.
Modify your eating and sleeping patterns to accommodate your treatment. For example, if you’re in a wheelchair, it may be easier for you to rearrange the lower floor of your home so that you don’t have to climb up your stairs. You may also want to order take-out so that you don’t have to stand and prepare foods.

, Eating foods high in calcium and vitamin D may help strengthen your kneecap and other bones. This could help heal your injury and prevent future dislocations.


Calcium and Vitamin D often work together to strengthen bones.
Good sources of calcium include milk, spinach, soybeans, kale, cheese, and yogurt.
Try taking calcium supplements if don’t get enough calcium in your diet. Aim to get as much calcium as you can from whole foods.
Good sources of vitamin D are salmon, tuna, beef liver, and egg yolks.Take Vitamin D supplements if you can’t get all of your Vitamin D through food.
Consider eating foods fortified with calcium or Vitamin D., Wearing clothing, especially pants, with dislocated knee can be uncomfortable and challenging. Choose clothing that will be easy to put on and take off and won’t make you uncomfortable.


Wear loose pants or shorts. You can also opt to not wear pants around the house.
Split pants or shorts down the seam and sew in Velcro to make them easier to take on and off.

, You may find certain activities challenging. Asking friends or family members to help you while you’re recovering may make your life easier and more comfortable.


Ask someone to carry your things when you’re going places so that you don’t put too much weight on your joint. If you need to be off your feet, see if someone would be willing to help prepare your meals.
Strangers are often more likely to help you while you’re injured. From helping you with groceries to holding doors open, take the chance to rest in these cases.
Avoid any challenging activities. Certain activities, such as driving, may present more of a challenge with a dislocated knee. In these cases, look for alternatives such as asking your friends or family members to give you a ride, or you could take public transportation.

Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Eat complex carbs.,
Don't forget protein.,
Know the difference between good and bad fats.,
Cut out processed foods.,
Watch out for sugary drinks.,
Sip on water.,
Don't skip meals.,
Stop eating when you're full.,
Don't eat for emotional reasons.,
Don't obsess over food.,
Don't be caught unprepared.,
Don't store junk food in your house.,
Try counting calories.,
Use healthy last-minute diet tricks.,
Exercise.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Eat Like a Model," Eating fruits and vegetables will provide your body with the nutrients it needs and, because they are relatively low in calories, you will get to enjoy eating higher volumes of food than you would if you were eating high-fat foods. This will leave you feeling more satisfied.If you have a hard time eating enough fruits and vegetables, try juicing them.;
, Carbohydrates are also important for a healthy diet, but aim for whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates. Brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and oats are all good options., Protein is extremely important because it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time, which will prevent you from overeating. Protein also requires more energy to digest than carbohydrates, which means you are burning more calories.Meat and fish are excellent sources of protein. You can also get protein from eggs, lentils, beans, cheese, yogurt, whole nuts and nut butters.

, It's good to consume a moderate amount of polyunsaturated fat, which is found in things like nuts, olive oil, avocados, and fatty fishes. Limit your consumption of saturated fats, which are found in meat and dairy products, by choosing low-fat options., Anything that is made with chemicals or refined ingredients is considered a processed food. This includes everything from white bread to bacon to potato chips. Overly processed foods are bad for you because they are typically high in calories, bad fats, salt, and sugar, but low in fiber, vitamins, and nutrients. This means you will not feel satisfied for very long, so you will continue to consume more and more calories.

Processed foods can also be addictive. It might be hard to cut them out at first, but once you get used to eating real food, you'll be glad you did.

, If you're drinking soda, juice, or sweetened coffee, you are probably consuming extra calories. The body doesn't process these liquid calories the same way it does with solid food, so you will probably feel just as hungry after drinking them.Diet sodas are not helpful for weight loss either. Even though they are calorie-free, they still trigger your body's production of insulin and storage of fat. Studies have shown that people who drink diet soda regularly are more likely to gain weight than people who don't., In addition to keeping your body hydrated, drinking water can also help you eat less. Your body can sometimes mistake thirst for hunger, so the next time you think you feel hungry between meals, see if you feel satisfied after a bit of water.Try to drink at least eight glasses of water each day.
If you find plain water too boring, add some fruits (e.g. lemon, lime) or herbs (e.g. mint) to it for added flavor.

, Skipping meals can cause your metabolism to slow down and it can also cause you to overeat because you will be very hungry by the time you do allow yourself to eat.Eating small snacks between meals is helpful for some people. If this helps prevent you from overeating at meals, go for it! For the best results, try a protein-packed snack that is 200 calories or less.

, Many people will eat as much food as there happens to be on their plate, without stopping to think if they are still hungry. Start being more mindful by stopping yourself after you've finished half of your food and asking yourself if you are satisfied or still hungry. Don't deprive yourself of more food if you are still hungry, but stop eating if you realize you are not.It might also help to eat a little slower, so your body has a chance to begin digesting and can let you know when it has had enough.
Practice what is known as ""hara hachi bu,"" which means eating until you feel about 80% full., It might be hard to recognize at first, but the next time you reach for a snack between meals, ask yourself if you are feeling angry, lonely, or tired. If you are, think about other things you can do to feel better. Going for a walk or calling your best friend might give you the pick-me-up you need., While it's important to make good decisions, try to take a more relaxed approach to it. You will have much more success in losing weight if healthy eating habits become a regular habit that you don't have to think about.


Try thinking more about the healthy foods that you will add into your diet than the bad foods you will eliminate. Also, try to find healthy foods that you genuinely enjoy eating. If you do both of these things, you may not even crave unhealthy foods anymore.
Instead of depriving yourself of the foods you love, allow yourself a little indulgence once in awhile. In fact, deprivation can lead to overeating, so it may be healthier to give in to your cravings every so often. This means you can still eat chocolate or bacon, as long as it's in moderation., Always bring healthy snacks, like raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, and low-fat yogurt with you when you go out. This will prevent you from giving into temptation if you get hungry and there are no healthy options available where you are., It's much easier to avoid eating junk food if you don't have any readily available. When you feel the need to indulge yourself, go to the store and purchase a single serving of your favorite snack. Bringing it home will make it very hard to keep yourself from overindulging., If you need the structure of a diet to reach your goals, keep track of everything you eat and calculate the number of calories you are consuming by using an online calorie counter. Then compare that number to the number of calories you actually need.You can find this out by using an online Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator, like the one here; http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/


Use this information to cut your calories by a safe amount. A modest reduction in calories, combined with a modest increase in activity, can go a long way in helping you reach your weight loss goals.
Never consume less than 1,200 calories per day unless you are instructed to do so by a doctor and you are under medical supervision.
To help you keep track of your calories on the go, try downloading a mobile app such as MyFitnessPal or SuperTracker.

, If you need to slim down for a big event, make sure to diet in a healthy way.Ramp up your healthy eating habits by making sure everything you eat is high in nutrients and vitamins.
One easy trick is to cut out foods that cause inflammation. Common culprits are alcohol, grains, and sugar. Instead, eat lots of green vegetables. This should leave you looking and feeling less bloated in a pinch.

, Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of exercise each day. You can incorporate a combination of structured workouts, like jogging or taking a yoga class, and everyday activities, like walking up the stairs, into your lifestyle.Assess your activity level by wearing a pedometer. This will give you a good idea of how much you are already moving during an ordinary day and how much activity you need to add into your daily routine.
A combination of different types of exercise is ideal because it will allow you to focus on different muscle groups., In order for your body to function at its best, it needs ample time to recharge and regenerate. Aim for eight hours of sleep every night. If this is impossible, see if you can get an extra 15 to 30 minutes each night. Anything helps!"
"
Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.,
Use ibuprofen to bring down swelling.,
Get a prescription for hydrocodone (Vicodin).,
See a physiotherapist.,
Wear a knee brace.,
Know that surgery may be necessary if the ligaments are torn.",How to Deal with a Knee Sprain2," Acetaminophen is used for mild to moderate pain. It is available over the counter and is one of the most common drugs used for knee pain.


Take 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours.Higher doses damage the liver. Patients with liver disease should be monitored for side effects.

, Ibuprofen belongs to a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). These drugs work to combat both pain and inflammation.


Take 200 to 400 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours.Ibuprofen may cause your stomach to become upset. Patients with ulcer and kidney diseases should avoid NSAIDs.

, Hydrocodone is used for moderate to severe pain, usually in combination with acetaminophen. It belongs to a class of drugs called opioid analgesics which are morphine-like drugs and are powerful painkillers.


The common dose is either 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg, depending on the amount of acetaminophen you are taking., Physiotherapy is helpful in maintaining muscle strength during the healing process when activity is limited. Do some light exercise every three to four hours for five to ten minutes.


Try walking normal with your heel down first. You can use crutches in the early days after injury to avoid bearing weight on your knee.
Lie down and bend and straighten your knee for 10 seconds. Repeat this exercise multiple times in a day.
Sit and straighten your legs. Place a small pillow beneath your affected knee and exert pressure downwards for 10 seconds. Repeat this multiple times a day.

, A knee brace can be very helpful during the healing process as it will prevent unnecessary knee movements and will give stability to your injured joint. However, do not wear the brace for long periods of time, as it may weaken muscles.A knee brace should not be too tight or loose. A tight brace can cut off circulation to your feet and ankles while a loose brace can slide down the knee and be of no use. A simple method to see if you are wearing the brace correctly is to slide down two fingers behind straps. If you are unable to pass two fingers under the straps, then the brace is too tight; loosen the straps. If after passing two fingers you can pass the third finger too, then the brace is too loose; fasten the straps and repeat the two finger method.

, When ligaments are torn, they do not heal with simple measures. Surgery is the only way to treat torn ligaments. An MRI will decide whether ligaments are only stretched or torn too.Surgery may involve using part of another ligament or tendon to repair the injured ligaments. Tendons are strong fibrous bands, just like ligaments, that anchor muscles to bones.
Partial ligament tears can take about three months to heal while complete tears need six months to one year for complete recovery. You should not return to full activity until the ligaments are fully healed.

Recognize the symptoms of a knee sprain.,
Understand how knee sprains are diagnosed.",How to Deal with a Knee Sprain3," The major symptoms of a knee sprain are as follows:


A popping sound or feeling at the time of injury can sometimes be heard if a ligament is completely torn.
Swelling of your knee. Ligaments are rich in blood supply. When they are injured, they tend to bleed inside the knee resulting in knee swelling. The degree of swelling will depend on the extent of injury to the ligament. Minor injuries will cause minimal swelling while a completely torn ligament can result in significant blood loss and knee swelling.
Pain in your knee. Again, the degree of pain may depend on the severity of the knee injury.
Tenderness around your knee on touching. This may be mild tenderness over the actual ligament in minor sprains, or more generalized and severe tenderness if a ligament is torn.
Restricted knee movements. In complete ligament tears, movement can be severely reduced, whereas in minor sprains, you may have a relatively good amount of knee movement.
Limping. Ligaments are vital for knee stability during movements. When ligaments are injured, you may limp when try to walk or run.
Bruising around your knee can sometimes appear, although not always. It may take some time for bruising to develop. Bruising is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels just beneath the skin.

, Two imaging studies are important for knee sprains: Xray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).X rays: X-rays are done to see whether knee bones are injured or not. A simple knee sprain will not have any bone fracture but with more a severe injury to knee, bones can be fractured too.
MRI: An MRI uses magnetic waves to visualize soft tissues of the body. An MRI of the knee will give valuable information about any tear or rupture of ligaments, whether partial or complete.

Don't arrive at the restaurant starving.,
Choose restaurants that offer healthy alternatives.,
Select foods that are steamed, broiled, baked, grilled, roasted or poached.,
Ask for a glass of water or water with lemon juice instead of drinking a high-calorie soft drink or alcoholic beverage with your meal.

,
Eat a large salad with plenty of raw vegetables in it before or with your meal.,
Pay attention to portion size.,
Remove skin and visible fat from your poultry or meat if it was not removed before serving.

,
Pick wholewheat bread and whole-grain pasta whenever possible.

,
Order fruit or gelatin for a light dessert, or skip dessert altogether.

",How to Eat Healthy When Eating Out," Whenever possible, if you're hungry, eat a small amount of some healthy food (vegetables- including cooked/roasted, a fruit, yogurt etc.) at home. Not being hungry when it's time to order at the restaurant helps in making better decisions regarding the type and amount of food.
, Before making reservations or sitting down at the table, ask the restaurant if they will do the following things:


Accommodate requests on cooking instructions and ingredients.
Use lean cuts of meat and trim visible fat from poultry or meat.
Serve butter, gravy, sauces and dressings on the side so you can add only the amount you need.
Offer margarine instead of butter and low fat milk instead of cream.

, Avoid cooking methods that use oils and fats, such as frying.

,, Be sure to order the dressing on the side and only use as much as needed. Try dipping your fork into the dressing to get a small amount on the tines before spearing the lettuce.

, Most restaurant meals have enough food on the plate to serve two people.


Split an entrée with your dinner or lunch partner. Half of a restaurant meal along with a salad is probably enough food.
Eat half of the portion served to you and then bring the rest home to eat another time.
Skip the entrée altogether and just order an appetizer or a bowl of soup and a salad.

Eat a balanced diet.,
Manage calories wisely.,
Eat lean protein.,
Eat a fruit or vegetable at each meal.,
Choose whole grains.,
Eat only moderate amounts of soy.,
Don't supplement with iodine.",How to Eat Healthy With a Hypothyroid Condition1," A well balanced diet is the key to help you meet your basic nutrient needs, prevent any deficiencies and maintain overall health.People with hypothyroidism are not any different. There is no special diet for an underactive thyroid. However, maintaining a well-balanced diet can help minimize any side effects.Aim to eat foods from each food group daily. Every group offers your body a different set of valuable nutrients.
Also have a varied diet. That means, try to choose a wide variety of foods within each food group throughout the week.;
, Although you may not need to lose weight, it's important to monitor your weight and calorie intake as obesity and weight gain are a fairly common side effect of hypothyroidism.Start by keeping track of your current calorie intake by using a food journal or a food journal app on your smartphone. Once you know what you're currently eating, you'll be able to make some changes if necessary.
If you feel you need to lose weight try cutting out about 500 calories daily. This generally results in a one to two pound weight loss each week.If your weight is only going up very slightly or you notice a very slow rise in weight, you may only need to cut out 250 calories a week.
Use your food journal or app to figure out what calorie level is best for you. For example, if you cut out 250 calories daily but still notice weight gain, try cutting out 500 calories daily.

, Eating adequate protein daily is very important for a well balanced diet. It's an essential macronutrient (a nutrient you need in relatively large amounts) and provides your body with the building blocks of many vital functions.To make sure that you're eating enough protein, aim to have one serving at each meal. One serving is about three to four oz or about 1/2 cup of beans or lentils.Measure your portions to help you stay on track.
The benefits of choosing leaner proteins is that these come with fewer calories and can help you stay within a designated calorie level.Choose proteins like: fish, shellfish, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes, tofu or pork.

, Both fruits and vegetables are considered nutrient dense foods and are a vital part of a balanced diet. Nutrient dense foods are ones that are relatively low in calorie but very high in a variety of nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals.


Ensuring you have a fruit or vegetable (or both) at each meal will help you meet your daily recommended five to nine servings. It'll also help bulk up your meals with fewer calories.
Like protein, it's still important to measure your portions - even on low calorie foods. Measure out a 1/2 cup of fruit, one cup of vegetables or two cups of salad greens.
There has been some conflicting studies on some vegetables - cruciferous vegetables - and whether or not they are harmful to those suffering from hypothyroidism.Although there is no conclusive evidence, do not eat large amounts of items like: cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower or brussel sprouts. You do not need to avoid them, but monitor your intake.

, 100% whole grains are a great addition to a balanced diet and can help provide your body with much needed fiber.In addition, there is no evidence to say these foods are harmful to those suffering from hypothyroidism.


Whole grains are considered more nutritious or nutrient dense compared to refined grains (like white flour, white bread or white rice) because they contain all the parts of the grain. This makes whole grains much higher in fiber, protein and many other nutrients.Again, make sure to measure your portions of these foods. One serving is one ounce or about 1/2 cup.Choose whole grains like: quinoa, millet, whole oats, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread and brown rice.

, Eating soy when you have hypothyroidism has been a widely debated subject. However, there aren't studies that have been able to conclusively say to avoid soy if you have hypothyroidism.Soy is found in a large variety of foods. It will be difficult and take a lot of time to avoid all soy. However, if you have hypothyroidism you may want to limit eating large quantities of soy-based foods or limit foods that are high in soy.
Foods that contain large quantities of soy or are mostly soy-based include: edamame or soy beans, miso (miso paste or miso soup), meat alternatives (like vegan deli meat, chicken nuggets, cheese or hotdogs), soy milk and soy yogurts, soy nuts, soy sauce (and dressing and marinades using soy sauce), tempeh and tofu.Many soy products are considered to be a protein alternative. So a serving would be three to four oz or about 1/2 cup of soy beans.Stick to these servings and consume moderate amounts throughout the week.

, It's common to associate your thyroid gland with iodine. Many people also think taking iodine supplements can help cure or resolve their hypothyroid condition. However, it's advised not to take these supplements.Generally, iodine deficiency is not the cause of hypothyroidism - especially in the US.Taking extra iodine will not change your condition and in some people can worsen your condition.
Iodine is prevalent in Westernized diets (especially in the US). Iodine has been added to a variety of foods (like iodized salt) that helps prevent deficiencies.A true iodine deficiency in Westernized countries is very, very rare.

Take regular measurements.",How to Eat Healthy and Exercise," Eating healthier is a great goal, but a broad one. To help you tailor your goal and figure out exactly what you need to do differently, start by doing a few days of a food recall.


A food recall is when you write down detailed notes about what you eat and drink in one day. Include all meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), any snacks or nibbles throughout the day and anything you drink (or add to your drinks).Be as detailed as possible. If you're not good at remembering what you ate over the last few days, try keeping a food journal for a few days, either on paper or using a smartphone diet-tracking app.
After you have your notes, review them and see where you can make changes. This will help you set goals for yourself and design an appropriate meal plan.
Examples of things you may want to change include: eating breakfast on a regular basis, drinking less soda, eating more vegetables or snacking less.;
, A meal plan will be a great help to you when you're attempting to make changes to your eating pattern and style. This will be a guide or blueprint for all your food choices.A meal plan can be very detailed or just a few notes, but take some time and write out your ideas of what you are going to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverages for the coming week.
Having a week or two of meals laid out in front of you can help you visually see if you're making the right changes to your diet. You can look and see if you're meeting your goals, like including a vegetable at each meal or scheduling a balanced breakfast every morning.
Use your meal plan to guide you throughout the week. You can also use it to help you write up a grocery list to make sure you purchase everything you need at the store.

, One of the main components to ""eating healthy"" is having a balanced and varied diet.Without these, it's difficult to make sure you're eating a nutritious diet.


A balanced diet means that you're eating the right amounts of the right types of foods for you.For example, you don't want to eat mostly grains and forget about fruits and vegetables.
Also, make sure that you have a varied diet as well. That means eating a wide variety of foods from within each food group. For example, don't only go for an apple every day. Rotate through apples, oranges, berries or pineapple.
A combination of both a balanced and varied diet will provide the basis for a nutritious diet that provides with you with all the recommended vitamins and minerals you need.

, One of the ways to make your meal balanced and nutritious is by filling up half your plate with a fruit or a vegetable.


Both fruits and vegetables are low-calorie and high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.These foods are main sources of many essential nutrients.
Include one to two servings of either fruit or vegetables at each meal and snack. One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup or one small piece,and one serving of vegetables is 1 cup of chopped veggies (like carrots or broccoli) or 1 to 2 cups of leafy greens like kale.If you can, try to choose the fruits and vegetables that are the most nutrient-dense. These foods are incredibly high in nutrients compared to others and are typically darker and brighter in color.For example, dark green vegetables like spinach or kale are much higher in vitamins (especially Vitamin A and K) when compared to iceberg lettuce, which is almost white.

, Lean protein is another essential component to your diet. Protein provides the building blocks your body needs to function every day.To meet your daily recommended needs, include a 3 – 4 oz serving of protein at each meal. One serving is about the size of your palm or a deck of cards.Leaner proteins are lower in calories and fat compared to proteins that are less lean and make an important part of a healthy diet.Choose foods like: poultry, eggs, lean pork, lean beef, seafood, tofu and legumes. Limit fattier protein sources like sausage, bacon, deep-fried fish/chicken, processed meats and higher-fat beef and pork.

, Grain-based foods make up a large part of many diets. Foods like breads, rices and pastas are delicious and can be a part of a healthy diet. Make most, if not all, of your grain choices 100% whole grain.


Whole grains are minimally processed and contain each part of the grain (the bran, endosperm and germ). This makes whole grains higher in fiber, protein and other nutrients that are beneficial to your diet.More refined grains like white bread or white rice are stripped of those vital nutrients. These types of foods should be limited in your diet.
Stick to 1/2 cup or 1 oz servings of whole grains.Try foods like: 100% whole grain breads and pastas, brown rice, quinoa, oats, millet and barley.

, Outside of foods, drinking adequate fluids can also help you have a healthier diet. Although water doesn't provide any nutrients, it's an essential part of your diet.


Water is important for a variety of functions in your body including regulating body temperature, maintaining acid/base balance, lubricating joints and managing your blood pressure.Most health professionals recommend consuming anywhere from eight to 13 8-ounce glasses of water daily (1.9 to 3 liters). This will differ for everyone based on gender, age and activity level. You should drink enough so that you do not feel thirsty at any point during the day.Stick to clear, sugar-free and decaffeinated beverages. Try: water, flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee and tea.
Limit sugary drinks and alcohol. These contain excess calories and provide little to no worthwhile nutrition.Keep alcohol at a max of one serving or less daily for women and two servings or less for men., Snacking can get a bad rap in terms of ""healthy eating."" Many people associate snacking with foods like chips or candies; however, eating a healthy snack can help improve your overall diet.


Snacks are a great addition to your diet when you're feeling hungry and your next meal isn't for another few hours, to help you fuel up for a workout, or recover from an intense exercise session.Snacks can lead to unhealthy weight gain if you eat when you're not hungry or out of boredom, or if you choose unhealthier foods.Snacks, like your meals, should be well-balanced and contain a combination of lean protein, fruit, or vegetables.
Limit processed foods, foods with added sugars or those that are higher in fat and calories. Desserts, candies, cookies, pastries or chips should be limited. You do not have to avoid these foods completely, but these treats should only be eaten in moderation.
Examples of nutritious snacks include: 1/2 cup of yogurt with 1/2 cup of fruit; four whole grain crackers with 1 oz of low-fat cheese; a handful of nuts (raw walnuts, almonds, macadamia nuts); or an apple with a low-fat cheese stick.

, Many times people perceive healthy eating as ""boring and flavorless."" Actually, the opposite is true, especially if you take the time to make foods you truly enjoy.


Don't misconceive healthy eating as only salads, plain steamed vegetables or baked lean proteins without any flavors. Spending some time researching different ways to make healthy foods enjoyable will be to your benefit.
If you're not truly enjoying the foods you're eating, you most likely won't continue with your healthy eating pattern long-term.
Start by reviewing the recipes of some of your favorite foods or meals. You can always add in extra veggies to baked dishes like baked pastas, meatballs, meatloaf and even cakes. Use 100% whole grain flour when baking and swap the sugar for applesauce.
For example, if you love mac and cheese, add some pureed butternut squash to the sauce and toss in some of your favorite vegetables with the noodles. You could also try making homemade baked sweet potato fries instead of regular french fries. Add shredded carrots or zucchini to cakes, cookies and muffins for an extra hit of nutrition.

, Like your meal plan for healthy eating, spend some time thinking about what types of exercise you'd like to include for your activity.


There are many different ways to be active. The more you enjoy your workouts, the more likely you are to stick with them long-term.
Consider what types of activity you may want to include. It is important to include both cardio and strength training activity each week for the best overall exercise and health benefits.Gyms are a great place to join if you want to work on adding in physical activity. You have access to group classes, cardio machines, weight machines and personal training staff.
If you're not one for the gym, consider what activities you can do at home. You may want to purchase exercise DVDs, plan a walking/running route or find free online videos.
Find activities you want to do each week and schedule them into your day and week., One main type of exercise is aerobic exercise (cardio). These activities have a lot of great health benefits when done on a regular and weekly basis.


The USDA recommends doing about 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity cardio activity each week. Moderate intensity activities are those that make you sweat and get your heart rate elevated for at least 10 – 20 minutes.The benefits associated with cardio exercises include: weight loss or healthy weight support, decreased risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, decreased risk for obesity, improved mood and sleep habits.Do a combination of activities that you've planned out. They can be anything from swimming, dancing, hiking, walking or doing a gym aerobics class.

, In addition to cardio, you should do strength training each week. These exercises offer different health benefits than cardio and will help round out your physical activity regimen.


Strength or resistance training exercises aim to help build your lean muscle mass. The benefits include more dense and hard bones, decreased risk of osteoporosis, increases in lean muscle mass and increased metabolism.Activities like weight lifting, yoga or pilates can all count as strength training. Choose your favorite activity and include it two to three days a week in addition to your cardio., The last main type of activity is baseline or lifestyle activity. Although it's not considered planned or consistent exercise, there are still a variety of benefits to increasing your baseline activity.


Lifestyle activities are those that you already perform as part of your daily life. These can include walking to and from your car, doing laundry, raking leaves and taking the stairs.These types of activities do not count towards your 150 minutes of planned cardio each week. These are done in addition to that.
Studies have shown that these activities may provide similar benefits to more traditional, planned physical activity (like going for a 30 minute jog). They can also increase or support these benefits if done in combination with planned physical activity., In addition to eating healthy and being physically active, visiting your doctor on a regular basis can help support your goals to be healthier.


Speak to your doctor regarding your new plan for a healthier diet and physical activity routine. They will be able to tell you whether or not your plan is safe and appropriate for you.
Talk to your doctor about why you want to eat healthier and exercise more often. They may have some tips for you and may be able to let you know long-term whether or not your plan has had a positive effect on your health.
Your doctor may also be able to refer you to a registered dietitian or personal trainer to help you get additional guidance on your goals.

, When you're first starting with a new type of diet and exercise plan, it can be exciting and fun. Over time you might get bored with your routine which may make it more likely that you'll give up.Trying new things to keep your routines fresh can help you stay motivated and interested in your plan for a healthier lifestyle.A few ways to keep your healthy eating plan fun and fresh are by: trying new recipes, buy a new ingredient or new item you've never tried, or try recreating your favorite restaurant or comfort foods at home.
You may also get bored with your fitness routine. Like your diet, there are some ways to keep things fresh like: signing up for a race or competition, find an exercise buddy, signing up for a new gym class or listening to a good audiobook while you work out.

, Starting a journal is a great way to help you stay on track with your new diet pattern and fitness routine.


Try journaling about your old eating habits, what you want to change and how it's going with your new eating habits. A food journal can provide you with a lot of insight on why you eat, when you eat and how certain foods affect your body.You can also use your journal to write out your meal plan and fitness plans for the week.
It may also be a good place to track your progress towards your goals. You can make notes about how easy or hard it's been and how your goals have changed over time.

, Regardless of what your ultimate end goal is, taking some measurements may help keep you on track with your healthy eating and activity plan long-term.When you eat healthier and are more active you may lose some weight. Regular weigh-ins can help you see how your new goals have affected your weight. Weight yourself once a week — you're more likely to stick with your plan if you weigh yourself regularly. Make sure you do it at the same time of day each week, wearing the same clothing.You may also want to consider tracking your clothes size, waist or hip size as well. If you notice any of your measurements getting too big or too small, you can return to your journal and make any changes you need to your eating and fitness plans.

Make sure carbohydrates comprise 45% to 65% of the athlete’s total caloric intake.,
Aim for proteins to comprise between 10% and 30% of the athlete’s total caloric intake.,
Strive for a diet with fats comprising 25% to 35% of the athlete’s total caloric intake.",How to Eat As a Young Athlete1," Carbohydrates are key to a young athlete’s performance and health. The body stores glucose in muscles and the liver as glycogen, which is the most readily available source of energy. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products are all good choices.Avoid processed carbohydrates like muffins, cookies, and chips.
Opt for whole grains like oatmeal, whole wheat, or brown rice.;
, Proteins are critical for the building and repair of muscle tissue, skin, hair, and nails. While proteins are not a primary source of energy during exercise, they help keep blood glucose at a healthy level through liver gluconeogenesis.Young athletes should choose lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products as protein sources.

, Fat is an essential element of proper nutrition, especially for young athletes. Fats help the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins and they also nourish the body with essential fatty acids. Fats are also a source of energy that is rich in calories.Saturated fats should be no more than 10% of the athlete’s total caloric intake.
Aim for good sources of fat including olive oil, sunflower oil, fatty fish (like salmon), and nuts.

Have healthy snacks on hand. Sometimes you need a snack to get you through a long period between meals. Foods like Greek yogurt, fruit, nuts or hard boiled eggs can give you a boost of nutrition and manage your hunger.

, Many supplements interfere with a variety of medications that are used to treat hypothyroidism.Make sure you time them throughout the day to minimize any complications.


Both iron supplements or multivitamin formulas that contain iron should not be taken at the same time as your medications.Calcium supplements, multivitamins containing calcium and medications containing calcium (like antacids) should also not be taken at the same time as your medications.Many other prescription medications may also interfere with your medications to treat hypothyroidism. Make sure to tell your doctor each medication or supplement you're taking and the dose.
Separate your supplements from your hypothyroidism medication by at least two hours.

, Like many supplements, there are a variety of foods that can also interfere with the absorption of your thyroid medications.There is no ""hypothyroid"" diet to follow. However, you do need to pay attention to your diet and timing of foods to make sure your medications work as intended. It's typically recommended to take thyroid medications on an empty stomach to prevent any issues.Some foods that can interact with your medications include: walnuts, soy-based products, cottonseed meal and calcium-rich foods (like dairy products).Try to take your thyroid medication at least three to four hours before or after eating these foods.It is best to take your medication in the morning or at night. For example, you can time doses so that you are consistently taking them either 60 minutes prior to breakfast or at bedtime (more than three hours after supper).

, Exercise is important for general health, but health professionals recommend exercise specifically for those suffering from a thyroid condition.Some of the side effects of a hypothyroid include weight gain or difficulty maintaining weight, depression, fatigue and insomnia. Exercise can help lessen these symptoms.Some health professionals recommend starting an exercise program with low-intensity exercises and lifestyle activities. It's an easier and more gentle way to get in the habit of being active - especially if you're dealing with fatigue. Yoga, walking or stretching are great areas to start.
Over time, try to work up to 150 minutes of physical activity each week.This is recommended for most healthy adults and can help you deal with side effects.

Cut out one snack at a time.,
Reduce your carbohydrate intake slowly.,
Replace sugary drinks with water and other non-sweet drinks.,
Swap out unhealthy ingredients with healthy ones.,
Maintain a checklist of your achievements.,
Stop eating out.",How to Ease Into a Healthy Diet1," Cutting out all of the things that you're used to eating could make your irritable or could make you violate your diet altogether. Identify times that you snack throughout the day and try to eliminate one of those snacks. Once you get comfortable without the snack, continue to eliminate snacks until you're just eating three healthy meals and one or two healthy snacks a day.The goal of the diet is to better your health without draining your energy or leaving you hungry.
Keep in mind that snacking is not necessarily a bad thing. It is just important to limit them and make sure you are snacking on healthy things like fruit, low-fat yogurt, and veggies with hummus.;
, Decreasing your carb intake can help you lose weight and may also reduce your risk of heart disease.Carbs are commonly found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and milk. While you don't want to cut out all of these foods, especially fruits and vegetables, you can do your best in cutting out high-carb products that don't hold much nutritional value otherwise. These foods include things like refined grains, sugars, and highly processed foods such as pasta.Replace sugar with things like berries or citrus.
You can cut down on refined grains by using whole wheat products.

, Sugary drinks and sodas contain a ton of sugar and carbs. Even non-sugar variations of most soda contain a significant amount of unhealthy sodium. Try to cut back, or eliminate sugary drinks altogether. If you are a big soda drinker, start by reducing the amount you have by a can or glass per week. You can also try other healthier alternatives like club soda with lemon or iced tea.Avoid sweet drinks such as soda, fruit juice, lemonade, Kool-Aid, and sweet tea.
Replace sweet drinks with unsweetened drinks such as water, flavored or sparkling water, and unsweetened tea.

, When you cook at home, you can use healthier alternatives for many harmful products in your kitchen. Replace high-fat variations with their low-fat counterparts. For example, ground beef can be substituted with lean ground beef, or ground turkey breast. Try to find other, healthier, or low-fat organic alternatives for the ingredients that you typically use.Replace regular bacon with leaner choices such as Canadian bacon, turkey bacon, or lean prosciutto.
Replace lettuce with more nutrient dense greens such as arugula, chicory, collard greens, dandelion greens, or kale.
Replace refined grains with whole wheat grains to get more nutrients and fiber.

, A visual list of things you've accomplished on your diet will motivate you and inspire you to strive to continue it. Create a list of goals, and check off your goals as you accomplish them. The satisfaction you'll get from making progress can motivate you to continue making good dietary decisions., When you eat out, you can't always control the quality or ingredients that are used in the food. The food could be packed with unhealthy ingredients that go against the diet that you have. Instead, try cooking at home more often. This allows you to control the ingredients and use things that adhere to your diet. It'll also remove the temptation of ordering something unhealthy off of a menu.If you do eat out, choose a restaurant that is aimed towards diet healthy eating.

Skip the premade mixes.,
Choose diet or 100% juice.,
Be mindful of how much soda you add.,
Keep your order or recipe simple.,
Choose low-calorie liquors.,
Stick to one to two drinks total.,
Measure the portion size of your beverage.,
Eat a little something with your summer cocktail.,
Drink water, too.,
Try a watermelon limeade.,
Make your own boozy Arnold Palmer.,
Mix up a summery mojito.,
Start your day with a mimosa.",How to Drink Healthier Summer Cocktails," Although those premade cocktail mixers are convenient, many are loaded with extra sugar and calories. To keep your summer cocktail on the healthier side, skip these mixers.Whether it's a margarita, daiquiri or piña colada, you can often find a premade mix in the grocery store or liquor store; however, these usually are higher in calories.
Instead of using these mixes, consider making your own cocktails from scratch. You'll be able to control the calories and total sugar much more easily.
Look for recipes online for your favorite drink mixes so you know what ingredients you need to use to make these beverages.;
, Many summer cocktails are mixed with one or more juices to give them a sweet flavor. Make sure you're careful about the type and quantity of juice you use in your summer cocktails.


Although juice isn't overly unhealthy, it usually contains a ton of sugar.
If you're using juice, always choose 100% fruit juice and stay away from the fruit juice cocktails and fruit flavored drinks.These have added sugar are are overly high in calories.
Also, keep the portion of juice low. Mix more seltzer water or diet soda instead of fruit juice. This will allow you to have some of the flavor, but keep total calories and sugar in check.

, Similar to fruit juice, many summer cocktails feature sodas to give them a little sweetness and extra fizz; however, sodas are also loaded with empty calories and sugar.


Sweetened beverages like sodas, are not something you should have in larger quantities or on a regular basis. Using them to make summer cocktails is something you should try to avoid or minimize.
Sodas and other sugary drinks have been linked to increased risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes and of having a heart attack.If you do want to have the fizz and flavor of some soda, go for diet sodas for a calorie-free beverage. Or, if you want to avoid artificial sweeteners, have a very small portion size (1 – 2 oz per drink) of soda.

, Another great tip for keeping your summer cocktail a little healthier is by keeping it simple. Whether you're ordering a drink out or are making some cocktails for friends, keep the recipe ingredients to a minimum.


Some summer cocktails have several ingredients. There could be multiple types of liquors, simple syrups, fruit juices, sodas, bitters, etc that can all end up adding up to a lot of calories or sugar.
Items that have just a few ingredients are easier to control. You'll only need to worry about the calories, sugar and portion size of just two or three ingredients.Consider ordering or making summer cocktails like a infused vodka and club soda or a mimosa with reduced calorie orange juice.

, Alcohol itself is relatively high in calories with roughly 7 calories per gram. Depending on the size of drink consumed, one can end up taking in more calories just from the alcohol before even considering the amount for calories from the rest of the ingredients in a cocktail.


Some liquors are overly high in sugar content, which makes them much higher in calories.Stick to distilled alcohol like vodka, whiskey, gin and rum. After being distilled, what remains is mostly alcohol with little to no carbohydrate content. A 1.5-ounce serving (1 jigger) has about 100 calories.
Liquors and cordials, like brandy or schnapps, are sweet to the taste which makes them a great summer cocktail mix in; however, this sweetness is from the extra sugar.

, When you're enjoying the occasional summer cocktail, make sure that you drink in moderation. Even if you choose healthier or lower calorie cocktails, you can still overdo it if you drink more than the recommended amount.


Health professionals will typically tell you to only drink occasionally and drink in small quantities. Women should have one serving of alcohol or less per day and men can have up to two servings daily.Also, don't drink on a regular basis. It's not recommended to have one to two drinks everyday either. Drink only occasionally during the week or month.

, Just like moderating how many drinks you have per day or per week, you also need to measure the overall portion size of your drink. This will help make sure you keep the total calories in check.


Again, even if you're making a healthier summer cocktail or found a recipe for a low-calorie drink, if you're not measuring the portion size and drink larger quantities of it, you'll still end up consuming more calories or alcohol than you should.
Always measure drinks that you consume. Measure them out when you're serving yourself at home or ask the bartender what the portion size is of drinks you order out.
In general, you want to have a mixed summer cocktail drink that has 1.5 oz of liquor or spirits. This counts as one serving of alcohol., If you want to keep your drinking moderate, make sure you eat as you sip your summer cocktail. This can help curb how much you drink overall.


If you don't have something to eat, or have an empty stomach when you start drinking, the alcohol will hit your body harder and more quickly.If you get a little tipsy or buzzed, you're more likely to drink and eat more and eat more. Alcohol increases the tendency to reach for salty, fatty and generally unhealthy foods, packed with extra calories. This inevitably causes weight gain and other health issues.
Instead make sure to eat a meal before having your summer cocktail or drink your cocktail along with some small appetizers. This helps slow the absorption of alcohol in your system.
In addition, alcohol can cause problems with the body's normal process of nutrient absorption and burning of energy. Since our bodies cannot store alcohol, removing it from the body takes preference over normal functions, which in turn interrupts the fat burning process.

, In addition to eating some food while you drink or before you drink, also plan on sipping on water too. This can help keep you hydrated and slow down your drinking pace.As a rule, try to alternate summer cocktails with a glass of water. This can help get in some hydrating, calorie-free fluids while you're also enjoying a cocktail.
For the whole day, it's recommended to aim for about 64 oz (2 liters) of clear, hydrating fluids. Go for water, sparkling water, or water with a squeeze of lemon or lime., The perfect combination of summertime flavor, this watermelon limeade is sure to please everyone. Make this ahead and have a pitcher on hand for BBQ or summer cookouts. To start, slice up some watermelon. Set aside three medium sized cubes of watermelon — these will be used to mix with the other ingredients.
In a glass, add the cubed watermelon, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and 1 teaspoon of agave nectar.
In a separate shaker cup, mix together 2 oz of a low calorie or ""skinny"" cosmopolitan mix and 1 oz of your favorite tequila. Shake together with ice.
Pour the shaken alcohol over the watermelon cubes and lime in your glass. Give it a quick stir and enjoy.

, If you enjoy a nice cold glass of summer tea or lemonade, this Arnold Palmer drink will definitely make you happy.


Start by making a pitcher of low calorie lemonade. You can make your own from scratch, by the premade diet lemonade or use the calorie-free lemonade flavoring packets.
Pour about 6 oz of the lemonade into a large glass with a few ice cubes. Then, measure out 1.5 oz of sweet tea flavored vodka. Add to the lemonade.
Gently stir or shake the lemonade and vodka mixture until combined. Serve over ice and enjoy.

, Another popular summertime drink is a mojito. Many times this sweet drink is overly high in calories and sugar. Try this lower calorie version instead.In a medium glass, pour in 2 oz of sake or rum (whichever you prefer). Add in a few ice cubes and stir to help chill the alcohol.
Also add in a splash of citrus flavored soda (like lemon lime), a splash a fresh lemon and lime juice and fresh mint.
Stir to combine all the ingredients. Try to bruise the mint gently to help release all the flavors. Serve over ice and enjoy.

, If you want to start your day with on a relaxing note, consider making yourself a mimosa. Full of 100% fruit juice, it's a great summer drink.


In a champagne or wine glass, pour in about 2 – 3 oz of champagne or sparkling wine. Choose a drier wine to cut down on the amount of sugar.
Then, add in about 2 oz of reduced-calorie orange juice. You can also use 100% orange juice, but this will have a more sugar and calories compared to the low-calorie version.
Stir gently and serve immediately.

Drink cactus water during exercise.,
Sip on cactus water before drinking alcohol.,
Choose cactus water when you're sick.,
Drink cactus water during the day.,
Make a breakfast smoothie.,
Mix with your favorite alcohol.,
Make a cactus water vinaigrette.,
Drink an adequate amount of fluid.,
Stick to hydrating fluids only.,
Keep water with you at all times.,
Check for signs of dehydration.",How to Drink Cactus Water for Health," Sip on this drink in place of your regular water. Cactus water (like many plant waters) is full of electrolytes and simple sugars (from the cactus fruit puree) and can help you during and after exercise.


One particular component of cactus water is taurine which is an amino acid. It helps the body reverse muscle tissue damage (like after exercise), repair and build muscle.In addition, taurine has been shown to help the body consume and use oxygen more efficiently during exercise.
Outside of athletic performance, cactus water also has a little bit of sugar and electrolytes which can help replace the fluids you've lost through sweat during exercise.
Sip on cactus water during and after exercise for the most beneficial effect.;
, No one enjoys going out for a fun night of drinks and waking up feeling a little nauseous and hungover. However, drinking cactus water might help curb those unpleasant hangover symptoms.


Studies have shown that cactus water may help prevent and even relieve symptoms of a hangover. Betalain (the antioxidants in cactus water) is responsible for relieving symptoms like nausea and dry-mouth.However, those same studies showed that the morning after headache is not affected or changed by cactus water consumption.Cactus water consumed before, during or after alcohol consumption was shown to be beneficial. Try consuming 8 oz before you go out and wake up to another 8 oz if you're feeling a little sick.

, Cactus water may also be beneficial when you're feeling a little under the weather. Drinking adequate fluids, including cactus water, can help support your immune system when you're sick.Any type of fluid is important when you're sick. Although you may not feel like drinking (or eating), it's important to drink fluids to help keep you hydrated and flush any toxins out of your body.
Cactus water in particular may be good because it has a little bit of sugar, antioxidants and electrolytes. This is the perfect combination when you're feeling under the weather.
If you're feeling a little sick, aim for a minimum of 64 oz of fluids daily. If you want, you can make half or more of these fluids cactus water.

, Cactus water and other plant waters do come in quite useful in certain situations (like during exercise or before going out on the town). However, that doesn't mean you can't drink cactus water more regularly.


If you have trouble getting in regular water because it's not appealing or lacking in flavor, drinking cactus water might help you meet your fluid needs everyday.Cactus water may be beneficial if your other options would be to use artificially sweetened flavored waters, powdered drink mixes or sports drinks. These are highly processed and can contain a lot of sugar or artificial sweeteners.
Cactus water is a much more natural source of antioxidants and electrolytes while still doing a great job at keeping your body hydrated.
As long as you can maintain your weight and can stay within an appropriate calorie goal, drinking cactus water throughout the day should be appropriate. It’s a great alternative to fruit juice for those watching their calories, as it only has about 14 calories and only 1 gram of sugar per cup., Since cactus water is full of nutrients and electrolytes, it makes an ideal liquid for a smoothie. You can blend it with your favorite fruits and vegetables for a nutrient packed breakfast.Start your smoothie the day or night before. Freeze cactus water into ice cube trays so you have frozen cactus water chunks.
Place about 1/2 to 1 cup of your favorite fresh fruit into the canister of a blender. In addition, add in a tablespoon of honey and a 1/2 cup of greek yogurt. Blend until just combined.
Last, add in about 1 cup of the cactus water ice cubes. Blend until your smoothie is creamy and smooth. Serve immediately.

, Since cactus water does such a great job at blunting a hangover, consider drinking it with alcohol. Mixed together with your favorite spirit, this plant water can help keep you a little better hydrated.Cactus water's naturally sweet flavor pairs well with spirits like vodka or tequila.
For a mixed beverage, shake together 2 oz of cactus water, 1 oz of tequila and 1 oz of seltzer water.
You can also mix 2 oz of cactus water with 1 oz of vodka and a splash of cranberry juice as well.
Alcohol intake should not exceed 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. One drink is defined as 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor.

, Another great little trick to use cactus water (and other plant waters) is in a vinaigrette salad dressing. The lightly sweet notes pair well with salads and other dressing ingredients.In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard, 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of cactus water and the juice of one lemon. Stir to combine.
While stirring, slowly drizzle in about 1/4-1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil. You want to stir until it's combined well.
Sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste. Give the dressing a quick taste and adjust for seasonings.

, Regardless of what type of fluid you drink each day, you need to aim for an adequate amount to stay well hydrated. If you don't meet your fluid needs you run the risk of becoming dehydrated.


Most health professionals recommended consuming at least 64 oz or about 8 glasses of hydrating liquids each day.This amount may change depending on your age, gender and activity level. Depending on these factors, your fluid needs may be up to 13 or more glasses daily.
For example, if you run 3 miles (4.8 km) every day, you will most likely need more fluid to stay hydrated.

, When health professionals recommend drinking 8 glasses of fluids daily, they're talking about specific types of fluids. Not all beverages count towards that recommended 8 glasses.


It's most commonly recommended to drink 8 glasses of water daily. It's naturally no calorie, sugar-free and caffeine free. It's the best option.
However, there are other beverages that can hydrate you. Cactus water and other plant waters (like coconut water), decaf coffee, decaf tea, sparkling water and flavored waters all count towards your fluid guidelines.
Sweetened, alcohol or caffeinated beverages do not count towards your 64 oz. Don't count sodas, coffee drinks, fruit juices, beer, wine or sweet teas.

, To help you meet those guidelines for all that fluid, you'll need to drink water consistently throughout the day. However, if you are busy or forgetful, it can be hard to stay on top of that fluid goal.


To help you meet your specific fluid needs, keep water on you at all times. If you constantly have a bottle of water or cactus water with you, you may be tempted to drink more frequently.If you don't want to continuously buy bottled waters, consider purchasing a reusable plastic or stainless steel water bottle. They're environmentally friendly and all you to fill up anywhere.
Keep water bottles everywhere you go as well. Keep one for your desk, keep one at home and also have one you leave in the car.

, Cactus water is a great beverage to drink to help prevent dehydration or replace fluids if you are already slightly dehydrated. However, you need to keep an eye out for signs of dehydration.


Thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status. Just because you're not feeling thirsty doesn't mean you don't need fluids. If you are feeling thirsty, that means you're already dehydrated.Also, check how often you urinate and the color of your urine. You should be going to the bathroom about 4-6 times a day. In addition, your urine should be pale yellow.
Other signs of dehydration are fatigue, headache and feelings of hunger. If you feel these symptoms, drink some water to see if they are relieved.

Start small.,
Be realistic with your goals.,
Learn about binge eating and other unhealthy dieting risks.,
Consult a physician before starting a new diet.,
Analyze and modify your slip-ups.",How to Ease Into a Healthy Diet2," It's hard to change bad habits that you've acquired over an extended period. Take pride in small victories, like cutting out sugar from your coffee in the morning, or eating carrots instead of chips at lunch. Do not go off and try to change your entire lifestyle, because it will be unenjoyable and often unhealthy for you.Understand that dieting is a gradual change and doesn't happen overnight.


An example would be switching from whole milk to skim milk.
Find healthier alternatives to snacks that you'd eat throughout the day without starving yourself.

, It's unrealistic and unhelpful to create unattainable goals for yourself. Set realistic, short-term goals for your diet and work every day towards these goals. Create deadlines for your initial set of goals and work towards achieving them. Instead of aiming to lose 30 pounds in 3 weeks, set a goal to lose 1-2 pounds this week. Once you meet that goal, aim to continue the trend for several months until your ultimate goal of losing 30 pounds is met.


Make sure your goals are SMART, which stands for specific, measurable, agreed-upon, realistic, and time-based., Substantial reduction in your daily caloric intake could leave you hungry, which could lead to binge eating. Also, a lack of essential nutrients and vitamins like vitamins A, C, and E could cause acne, dry hair and skin, hyperkeratosis, and broken fingernails.Be wary of ""crash diets"" or diets that concentrate on restricting or eliminating your daily intake of calories. These unhealthy diets can weaken your immune system and can result in dehydration, heart palpitations, and cardiac stress., To get the best advice for starting and maintaining a healthy diet tailored to your individual situation, you should consult your doctor. Talk to them about the diet that you are considering and ask them if any existing medical conditions would make the diet ineffective or unsafe. Ask your doctor for a referral to see a registered dietitian. They can provide you with new tactics or strategies that could help you choose smarter food choices.Remember to stay hydrated, get enough sleep, and slowly alter your eating habits to form to your new diet.

, It's easy to want to quit after making a mistake. However, in dieting, this won't result in better health. Instead of getting down on yourself every time you violate your diet, take an objective view of how you messed up, and think of what you can do to prevent yourself from doing it in the future. Don't dwell on making a mistake, and continue to work towards your dieting goals even if you mess up occasionally.For instance, if you mess up on your diet because you went to a gathering that had cookies and cake, try to stay away from gatherings that have cookies and cake or make sure to fill up on healthy food before attending an event that has unhealthy food.

Learn about calories.,
Follow dietary guidelines.,
Read labels.,
Cook.,
Snack.,
Add more flavor to your foods.,
Avoid fad diets.",How to Diet Properly1," Most dieters report that they count calories, but an overwhelming majority also say that they don't really know how many calories they need. We are trained to think that fewer calories means more weight loss, but really, you need to be mindful of where you calories are coming from, not just how many you consume.Men report eating an average of 2,600 calories per day, with women consuming about 1,800. You may need less than that if you are trying to lose weight, but you should always eat at least 1,200 calories a day. Any fewer and your body thinks it is in starvation mode. That means it will hold on tightly to fat stores.
Ask a registered dietitian or personal trainer to help you figure out how many calories you should eat per day for healthy weight loss. Take into account how active you are.
Make your calories work for you. Fill up on foods that have a lot of fiber (whole grains) and protein (lean meats). These will help you feel full longer and give you more energy.
Avoid ""empty"" calories that don't give your body much fuel. Alcohol and items like potato chips are good examples of calories that aren't serving much of a nutritional purpose.;
, The USDA has dietary recommendations to help ensure you get the proper amount of nutrients from your meals and eat a balanced diet. This means you are getting the proper amount of servings from each of the food groups without eating too much from any one group. You also want to vary the foods you eat in each group — don't only eat apples and no other fruits, for instance. Other key recommendations include: make less than 10% of your daily calories from added sugar; make less than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fats; and consume less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily.In addition, there are specific recommendations for the amounts of foods you should strive to eat every day. These are as follows:


Eat nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily. One serving of fruit is equivalent to about 1 cup of chopped fruit or one small piece of fruit. One serving of vegetables is equivalent to 2 cups of loose, leafy greens, or about 1 cup of cut veggies.
Eat six servings of grains per day and make at least half of those grains whole grain. One serving of grains is equivalent to one slice of bread or 1/2 cup of cooked rice or pasta.
Eat two to three servings of dairy per day, but try to make it low-fat dairy. 1 cup of milk is the equivalent to one serving of dairy.
Eat two to three servings of proteins daily. One serving of meat is 3 oz., or about the size of an adult's palm. One serving is also equal to one large egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, 1 ounce of walnuts, and 1/4 cup of beans.
Try to ""eat the rainbow,"" meaning eat foods that are a variety of colors (blueberries, red apples, asparagus, etc.). Different colored foods mean you are getting different nutrients and vitamins.

, Paying attention to the nutrition labels on food packages can help you make sure that you are making healthy choices. One of the most important parts of the label is the serving size information. This tells you how many servings are in each package, and what the nutrition facts are for each serving.You should also note how many calories are in each meal.
Try to limit the following nutrients: trans fats, saturated fats, and sodium. These are not only linked to obesity, but also to heart disease and high blood pressure.Look for foods that have significant amounts of fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, vitamin D, and calcium.
Your dietitian can help ensure you are getting all the nutrients you need and in the proper quantities.

, Eating out or buying prepared foods is convenient, fast, and easy. But it also means that you can't control how your food is prepared or what ingredients are used. One of the most effective ways to lose weight is to cook your meals at home. You can choose healthy cooking methods (e.g. baking instead of frying) and fresh ingredients.Plan your meals in advance. By making a weekly menu, you will be less likely to go off track and call for take-out midweek. You can make things easier on yourself by preparing healthy meals to keep in the freezer and eat as needed.
Make cooking fun. Treat yourself to a new set of knives or a cute apron. These sorts of things can give you the motivation you need to spend more time in the kitchen.

, Good news! You actually need to snack while you're dieting. Eating frequently keeps your metabolism going and will help your body burn more calories throughout the day. Healthy snacks can also reduce hunger and keep you from overeating at meals.The key is to make sure that you are choosing healthy snacks. Reach for fresh fruits and veggies, nuts, or low-fat dairy. Try some cucumber slices with hummus for a satisfying afternoon snack.
Keep healthy snacks handy in your desk at work. If you have some roasted almonds nearby, you'll be less likely to head for the cookies someone left in the break room.

, If foods taste great, you're more likely to eat them. One way to add flavor to any healthy food is to add some salsa. Try topping your baked potato with salsa instead of butter and you'll save on calories and fat. Bonus: you've also added an extra serving of veggies to your meal.Adding salsa to your chicken, fish, and even salads, can help liven up your meals and provide a little more zest. Try buying fresh salsa at the grocery store, or even making your own.
You can add flavor to almost any dish by adding herbs and spices, most of which contain almost zero calories. Try buying fresh herbs such as parsley, rosemary, or thyme. They will make your chicken, pork, or salad taste fresh and original.
Some ingredients offer an added bonus other than flavor. For example, garlic is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. Season your fish or soups with garlic for a flavorful meal that is also healthy.Turmeric is another popular, flavorful staple that should be in your spice rack. Try adding it to healthy salad dressings for an extra pop of flavor.

, It can be very tempting to try the latest trend in dieting. The media is often full of stories about celebrities who tried a fad diet and had great success. However, it is important to remember that not only do fad diets often not work, they can also be harmful to your health.Most fad diets require you to cut out a major food group, such as carbs. The most important part of a healthy diet is making sure that you are eating a well-rounded meal plan that includes all nutrients. Avoid diets that require you to cut out food groups.
Some fad diets can make you sick. Many fad diets promote eating a very low amount of calories, which can be dangerous to your health. Instead, eat the recommended number of calories for your body type and make healthy choices.

Choose a method.,
Determine your carb and calorie goals.,
Space out your days evenly.,
Come up with a meal plan.,
Monitor your progress.",How to Do Carb Cycling1," There is no one correct way to carb cycle. People use different carb cycling plans to meet their different needs and goals. Therefore, you should choose a carb cycling plan that suits you.


If you want to lose weight, for example, you might want to do a plan that involves low-carb days for five days each week, and then have two high-carb days.On the other hand, if you are looking to gain muscle, you might want to try a more even mix of four high carb days and three low carb days.
As an example, the “classic” carb cycling schedule involves alternating for 6 days each week between high- and low-carbs. On the seventh day, you get to have a “cheat” day where you don’t need to monitor your calorie and carb intake so closely.;
, As a general rule, on this diet, women should plan to take in about 1,200 calories each day and men should plan for about 1,500 calories on low-carb days. On high carb days, you’ll eat slightly more calories.


Another general rule to keep in mind when starting out is that on high-carb days you should aim to consume about 1.5 grams of carbs per pound of body weight. So if you weigh 150 pounds, you would want to consume 225 grams of carbohydrates. On low-carb days, you should try to avoid carbohydrate-rich foods, and stick to foods that are high in protein., It’s important to try to keep a balanced schedule, which involves spreading out your high- and low-carb days so that you don’t have too many of the same days back-to-back. Instead, try to alternate, or at least spread them so that your days are fairly even.For example, if you are doing two days of high carbs and five days of low carbs, you might feel tempted to make both Saturday and Sunday high-carb days. However, it would be better if you spread these two days out. For example, you could make Tuesday and Saturday your high-carb days.

, One of the best ways to stay on track with your carb cycling is to come up with a meal plan for each day. Make a detailed plan regarding what you will eat for each day of the week. Having a clear plan will help keep you on track.An example of a low-carb day meal plan could look like this:

For breakfast, two scrambled eggs plus half of a bell pepper.
As a morning snack, you can have a protein shake and a handful of berries (e.g. raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, etc.)
For lunch, have three ounces of grilled chicken with one cup of asparagus.
For an afternoon snack, have one-third of a cup of oatmeal (cooked) with ten almonds.
Have a three-ounce steak with two cups of steamed broccoli or cauliflower for dinner.


For a high-carb day, your meal plan might look like this:

Half a cup of oatmeal with walnuts and berries of your choice for breakfast
As a mid-morning snack, enjoy an apple with two tablespoons of nut butter (e.g. peanut butter or almond butter).
Half of a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread for lunch.
As an afternoon snack, eat one cup of three bean salad with one cup of quinoa.
For dinner, try three ounces of grilled chicken with one cup of whole wheat pasta topped with pesto.



, It is important to keep a close eye on your progress to see what is working and what isn’t working so you can adjust accordingly. If, after sticking to a schedule for a few weeks, you haven’t seen any progress, then you may need to adjust your carb cycling schedule. For example, if you’ve been eating low-carb for four days each week and high-carb for three days each week, you might want to try switching to five days of low-carb and two days of high carbs.Also look at the things you are eating. This diet relies on having a healthy eating lifestyle and is not a quick fix-all. On your high-carb days, you should be eating healthy sources of carbs such as fruits, whole grains, and legumes. On your low-carb days, you should still be eating healthy. Fish and lean meats, such as chicken are a good source of protein, which will help keep you from feeling hungry. In addition to that, you can eat leafy green vegetables that are low in carbs.

Restrict your diet to vegetables and broth.For the rest of the day, eat only mild preparations of vegetables (no spices) and clear broth.",How to Do a Liver Flush2," Stop after the night of sleeping on your side, before you take the enema in the morning. You will replace the enema with another dietary treatment., If you don't have sea salt, you can use the juice from half a lemon instead. Drink this mixture first thing in the morning.

, You should eliminate the gallstones through your stool sometime during the day.

Do not do an apple-based liver flush if you have certain medical conditions.This method will require you to drink large amounts of apple products.,
Go on a two-day apple juice fast.,
Take an olive oil and citrus juice mix on the second day.At 8:30 p.m. on the second day, mix ½ cup of olive oil with ½ cup of lemon juice or ¾ cup of grapefruit juice.,
Go to bed immediately.It may feel too early to go to bed, but it’s important to keep to the schedule for this liver flush.,
Drink a saltwater mixture in the morning of the third day.Dissolve two teaspoons of un-iodized sea salt into 4 cups of warm water.",How to Do a Liver Flush3," While apples are perfectly healthy in moderation, in excess they add a lot of sugar to your system. If you have cancer, a yeast infection, diabetes, hypoglycemia or a stomach ulcer, do not use this method.

, For centuries, scientists have researched ways to treat gallstones without surgery. A liver flush is a ""chemical contact"" treatment, in which you consume chemicals that break up the gallstone from within.Many chemical contact treatments doctors tried throughout history had long-term negative side-effects on patients. The malic acid and liminoid found in apples, though, have relatively benign side effects that last a short amount of time.Don’t drink juices made from concentrate or that have added sugars. Look for natural apple products.
Keep the juice at room temperature, and mix it with warm water to further raise the temperature when you drink it.
Drink 16 oz. (2 cups) of organic apple juice or apple cider every 2 hours between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on both days

, The juices should be freshly squeezed, not processed.


You may feel nauseous after drinking this mixture, but try to relax and see your way through it. You’ll feel better when the process is over!

, You’ve taken the olive oil and citrus juice mixture after about 36 hours of fasting, and now you need to go to bed. Remember to lay on your side to help the cleansing process.

, Again, you can substitute the juice from half a lemon if you don’t have sea salt.


Eat only vegetables and clear broths for the rest of the day. The nausea you felt the night before should pass once you get some food in your stomach, and you should pass your gallstones sometime during the third or fourth day.

Get moving.,
Stay rested.,
Reduce stress.,
Set healthy goals.,
Don't skip meals.,
Be mindful about eating.",How to Diet Properly2," Dieting properly is a great way to start living a healthier lifestyle. However, you'll see the best results if you also begin a healthy exercise regimen at the same time. Studies show that combining diet and physical activity will have positive benefits for your overall health and for weight loss.Aim to be active for at least 60 minutes per day. You can break this up into small sections to make it manageable. For example, try walking to work and taking the stairs instead of driving and taking the elevator.
Go outside. People who exercise outside report that they enjoy it more. Explore your neighborhood, or go hiking in a nearby state park.
Call a friend. When you make plans to exercise with a friend you will be more likely to stick to the plan. Ask a buddy to join you at yoga or go for a long walk with you after work.

, If you're not getting enough sleep, you might be more susceptible to weight gain. When you're low on rest, your body produces more cortisol, which is the stress hormone. This can make you more likely to reach for comfort foods instead of making healthy choices.Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per night. People who do tend to have a healthier body weight than people who clock only five to six hours per night.
Avoid using devices that emit blue light, which can keep you awake, at least 30 minutes before bed. These devices include smartphones, tablets, laptops, and televisions.Get on a schedule. If you try to go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at the same time each day, your sleep will be more restful and effective.

, There is a clear link between stress and weight gain. When you are stressed, your body releases more cortisol, which causes your body to retain more fat. This tends to happen especially in the abdominal region. To get the most out of your healthy diet, you need to work on reducing your stress levels.A great way to reduce stress is to make sure that you are exercising regularly. This releases endorphins and generally improves your mood.
Take deep breaths. Focusing on your breathing is a very effective method for reducing stress. Breathe deeply in and out, slowly inhaling and exhaling. This will slow your heart rate and help clear your mind.

, Part of living a healthy lifestyle is knowing how to set realistic goals. Avoid making impossible demands of yourself, such as ""I will lose 15 pounds this month."" Instead, set smaller, more achievable goals. Healthy weight loss is generally considered 1 – 2 pounds per week.Give yourself manageable goals, such as ""I will exercise six days this week."" That progress is easy to track, and you can reward yourself for achieving these mini-goals. Avoid food-based rewards — instead, your rewards might include buying new exercise outfit or shoes,

, You may be tempted to try and boost your weight loss by skipping meals, or you may simply get so busy or distracted that you forget to eat. Whatever the reason, skipping meals only serves to sabotage your diet. It may cause you to overeat later in the day or it may cause your body to cling to fat and slow down your metabolism.Aim for three meals with one to two snacks every day or four to six small meals.

, Eating while watching TV, looking at your phone, or while running out the door is common practice these days, but it may cause you to eat more. When it's time to eat a meal, remove all distractions and take a seat at the table. Focus on the food in front of you and take in it's smell, how it looks, it's taste and texture. Try setting your fork down between bites to ensure you take your time and chew thoroughly.>

Stay positive.,
Have a good body image.,
Be kind to yourself.",How to Diet Properly3," The power of positive thinking is not just a myth. In fact, positive thoughts are key to dieting properly. Thinking positive thoughts can increase your motivation and energy levels. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, can lead to behaviors such as emotional eating and skipping a workout. Avoid negativity. Try to not get angry at yourself if you slip up and reach for pizza instead of a healthier option. Instead, get back on track the next day.

, Some days it can be hard to feel comfortable in your own skin. It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices. Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day.
Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time.

, Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on."

Cleanse for three days.,
Eat often throughout the day.,
Search for recipes.,
Keep the soups natural.,
Drink water.",How to Do a Soup Cleanse2," Most soup cleanses last for three days, but they can last for one or even five days.You don’t have to eat soup for every meal for the rest of your life to reap the benefits. Start with one day, then a few weeks or months later, go for three or five days. Or start with a five day cleanse first. It’s up to you.

, During your soup cleanse, start by having six meals for yourself each day. Remember, you are just eating vegetable packed soups throughout the day and nothing else. If you are hungry, add another serving of soup to your day.


Some people suggest eating once an hour on a soup cleanse., Soups for the cleanse can be made by just adding any vegetables to your broth. Another way you can make easy soups is to put one vegetable, like kale, spinach, turnips, butternut squash, or beets, into a food processor and pureeing it to make a creamy pureed soup; however, if you want to get some more ideas for soups, search online. There are numerous detox soups or healthy soups for you to try.

, When making soups, be sure to only cook soups that include vegetables and all-natural ingredients. Do not eat any cream soups that contain dairy because soup cleanses removes dairy. Make sure not to eat soups with wheat products, flour, or pasta.


When a detox soup says a ""creamed kale or spinach,"" it means pureed, not that it contains dairy products.

, Water helps flush your body. It removes toxins and waste, and it also helps move nutrients to where they need to go. Try to drink eight to 10 eight ounce glasses of water during your cleanse."
"
Choose a soup cleanse over a juice cleanse.,
Decide if a soup cleanse is for you.,
Know the nutritional impact of a soup cleanse.,
Consult soup cleanse resources.,
Think about the negative side effects.",How to Do a Soup Cleanse3," Soup cleanses are much better for you than juice cleanses. Juice cleanses revolve around foods that are packed with sugar. Soup cleanses promote foods that have relatively low amounts of sugars. Due to the juicing process, juice cleanses remove a lot of the good parts of the fruits and vegetables by leaving the fibrous pulp behind. Soup cleanses give your body all parts of the vegetables so you get maximum nutrients., Soup cleanses are short-term eating plans where you eat nothing but soups for one to five days to rid your body of toxins. The idea is to help reduce inflammation, protect you against heart disease, weight gain, and joint pain, and increase your energy levels. Soup cleanses are also aimed at helping you get better looking skin and hair, along with reducing stress.Soup cleanses are meant to be temporary so you give your digestive system a break during the days of the cleanse., Soup cleanses detox your body by getting rid of toxins. Maybe even more important, you feed your body tons of nutrients when you do a soup cleanse. By eating these foods, you nourish your body and fill it with healthy, immune boosting ingredients. When you do a soup cleanse, choose easy-to-digest foods.Mostly you will be eating vegetables. However, you can add clean sources of protein to your soups if you need to. Foods like gluten, dairy, corn, and sugar, and all processed foods are not part of a soup cleanse.Pureed soups are easiest to digest. Consider eating pureed soups as often as you can.
Add some lemon to your water to give extra detoxing effects. Lemon helps increase digestion.

, If you want to do a soup cleanse, but don’t want to try it on your own, there are resources available. You can buy books full of recipes, plans, and information. You can also purchase soup cleanses where your days’ meals are mailed to you so you have no prep yourself., Soup cleanses have negative side effects to think about. For one, it is not a weight loss aid. You only do a soup cleanse one to five days, which isn't long enough to lose any weight, other than water. Soup cleanses can be so low in calories that you don't get the calories you need every day. You should never eat less than 1,200 calories each day. On soup cleanses, you can easily fall below that.Soup cleanses do not contain protein, unless you add enough beans or other protein sources.
Soup cleanses might make you feel fatigued or drained, give you headaches or dizziness, or make you nauseous.
A soup cleanse might give you an imbalance of nutrients, depending on the amounts of foods you are eating in your soups.
A soup cleanse might be difficult to maintain since it is inconvenient and takes a lot of prep.

Talk to your doctor.,
Try to make sure your carbs are good carbs.,
Allow yourself an occasional treat.,
Don’t skip breakfast.,
Recognize problems.",How to Do Carb Cycling2," For some people, eating a low-carb diet may actually be beneficial for dealing with other health problems; however, there may also be some health problems that could be exacerbated by a low-carb diet. Therefore, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor about carb cycling before beginning the diet.This is true for any major lifestyle change, not just carb cycling. It is important to learn how certain lifestyle changes might interact with any health conditions you may have before taking them on.

, Typically, carb cycling diets don’t restrict what you can and cannot eat. However, it stands to reason that when you do eat carbs, you should aim for foods that are healthy and unprocessed. For example foods such as rice, potatoes, whole grain bread, legumes, and other whole grains all provide a good source of healthy carbs.These are also known as resistant starches.
Some people also recommend limiting yourself specifically to what are called “complex carbohydrates.” This is in comparison to refined carbohydrates, which are usually highly processed and don’t contain much fiber. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, and nuts. These will be processed by your body more slowly and will keep you feeling full for longer., In order to stick to any diet over the long-term, you’ll have to allow yourself a reward. If you don’t, you will more than likely get frustrated and give up. Thus, you should allow yourself a cheat meal once per week. This doesn’t mean an all-out binge meal, but if you want to have a dessert with your meal or something that you normally wouldn’t eat, then allow yourself to have it.When you have your reward, try to really savor it. Don’t just gobble it all down without even tasting it.

, If you are on a low-carb day, you may think that an easy way to cut out some carbs (and calories) is to simply skip breakfast. However, you should not skip breakfast regardless of whether it is a low-carb day or a high-carb day. Eating breakfast is important for your overall well-being, and it often is helpful for losing weight.If you don’t have much time for breakfast, keep it simple. You can make oatmeal in a microwave in only a couple of minutes. If you are really running late, grab a banana.

, The idea behind carb cycling is to prevent the negative side effects that may occur as a result of a low carb diet. That said, there are risks that come with not getting enough carbohydrates in your diet, and some negative side effects may occur. If you notice any of the following symptoms, you may need to adjust your carb cycling schedule to balance out your diet.Headaches, weakness, bad breath, feeling tired, and constipation or diarrhea may all occur if your body is not getting adequate carbohydrates.

"
"
Be aware that carb cycling is designed to be easier on the body.,
Understand that carb cycling can prevent plateaus.,
Understand that carb cycling also means calorie cycling.",How to Do Carb Cycling3," Carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation in the last several years. Unfortunately, this bad reputation isn’t really deserved because carbohydrates play a huge role in keeping your body functioning and healthy. Restricting your carbohydrates over the long term can have negative effects on your body. Therefore, using carb cycling, you can give your body the carbs it needs to keep going while still losing weight.Carbohydrates are an essential fuel for your body. Without this fuel, your body slows down so that it can preserve energy.
For example, long-term carb restriction can cause the metabolism to actually slow down.

, Whether your goal is to gain muscle, to lose fat or both, many fitness professionals believe that carb cycling offers a good way to keep your body from plateauing. Thus, if you feel that you are having a more difficult time gaining muscle, or losing that last five pounds, a carb cycle may help get you over that plateau.This is because while you are essentially eating a low-carb diet, you are also “surprising” your body with a few days of high-carb intake. This prevents your metabolism from slowing down.

, On the days that you eat more carbs, you will also be eating more calories, and that is OK as long as your carbs are coming from healthy sources. This is because carbohydrates are simply naturally more calorie dense. On the days that you are eating low-carb, you will naturally eat fewer calories as long as you are sticking to healthy foods (e.g. lean meat, fish, and lots of leafy greens).This is especially important to understand if you are trying to lose weight because you may be worried that you are eating too many calories on your high-carb days. In general, if you are sticking to healthy high-carb meals with reasonable portion sizes, then those extra calories won’t be a problem.

Shift your eye.,
Talk to your doctor about floaters.,
Do nothing at all.Although floaters may be annoying, they usually don't interfere with your vision so much that you can't perform daily tasks.,
See a doctor immediately if floaters are accompanied by flashes of light or a loss of side vision.,
Talk to your ophthalmologist about special treatments if the eye floaters are causing serious vision disturbances.,
Undergo surgery if it is deemed necessary.,
Try dietary supplements to reduce floaters.,
Take supplements that increase blood flow.,
Find ways to reduce stress.",How to Reduce Floaters," If you happen to focus on a floater, try moving your eye up and down or side to side.The movement of the eye can shift the floater and provide relief.;
, If you have floaters that frequently disrupt your vision, new floaters that suddenly appear, or just have questions about them, talk to your ophthalmologist or physician. These professionals can help you determine if your floaters require medical intervention, based on your symptoms.


Although most eye floaters can be chalked up to a normal part of the aging process and treatment for eye floaters is not always needed, some rare cases require targeted medical intervention.Have your eyes checked by an optometrist or ophthalmologist at least once every two years or more often if you have certain medical conditions (like diabetes)., Normally, your brain learns to ignore floaters and adapts your vision accordingly.Nearsighted people or those with previous eye injury or certain conditions such as diabetes are more likely to experience floaters, or to experience them more frequently.You may have floaters for years, and they may fade in time. If you notice new ones, however, contact your ophthalmologist for an examination., If not treated immediately, the underlying condition could cause a loss of vision.Serious conditions associated with floaters include:


Vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding between the lens and the retina)
Vitreous and retinal inflammation (caused by infections or autoimmune inflammation)
Eye tumors
A tear in the retina (when numerous floaters suddenly appear)A detached retina (when accompanied by blurry or clouded vision)

, Severe cases of floaters can be treated with surgical techniques. Surgery to remove the incidence of floaters comes with serious risks. Most often, the risks associated with surgery are deemed far worse than the minor annoyance of an occasional floater.Your ophthalmologist can help you decide if surgery is needed or advisable, given your particular case.


Risks associated with eye surgery include cataracts, retinal tears, and retinal detachment, so surgical treatment is only recommended in extreme cases.Surgery may not be a permanent solution for floaters, since new ones can appear at any time.

, If you and your ophthalmologist decide that special treatments are necessary to reduce your floaters, there are a few options available. Make sure to ask your ophthalmologist any questions you may have about these procedures.

A procedure known as vitrectomy removes the actual vitreous from the eye and replaces it with a saline solution, eliminating the eye floaters in the process.Freezing therapy or laser therapy which super cools the eye, may be needed to correct retinal tears, and to reduce floaters., Some health professionals believe that certain nutritional supplements may help get rid of eye floaters. Nutritional supplements have not been clinically shown to reduce floaters, but some people may find them to be helpful. Discuss these treatments with your ophthalmologist before starting any of them:


Try antioxidant-rich substances such as turmeric and rose hips. There is some evidence that these antioxidants are effective in treating macular degeneration, but not in directly reducing floaters.Rose hips are commonly available as an herbal tea, and turmeric as a spice.
Consider hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid has been shown to be effective in helping eyes heal after cataract surgery.Some use hyaluronic acid to treat floaters, although no established medical connection has yet been formed.

, The idea is that increased blood flow will help your eyes better flush out the gelatinous protein from the vitreous. No proven connection, however, has been formed by the following supplements and floater reduction, so discuss these treatments with your ophthalmologist before starting them:


Try Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has been proven effective in increasing ocular blood flow and is used by patients suffering from glaucoma.Try lysine. Lysine is a vasodilator, which means that it widens blood vessels, particular in large veins. Lysine has proven effective in widening blood vessels in some areas, but not necessarily in the eyes.Try bilberry. Bilberry is used both for improving eyesight and for widening blood vessels. More tests are needed to investigate the efficacy of bilberry in treating floaters.

, Another potential irritant for eye floaters is stress, so practicing stress management techniques may reduce the visibility of them.Meditation, prayer or spending time in nature are some options people find helpful to lower stress levels. Daily exercise like yoga, Pilates or Tai Chi can also reduce stress and help you develop a more relaxing lifestyle.

Take a walk over to your health department (or review their website) to see what services are offered to students.


Work with the dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you. Consider your schedule, meal plans and dining options that you prefer. They will be able to give you meal plans and ideas for eating healthy on campus.
Many services provided by the health and wellness department are free or very reasonably priced for students.;
, It's important to eat consistently throughout the day. You might choose to eat three meals a day or four to five smaller meals throughout the day.Either way, you'll need regular meals to help fuel you through long classes and study sessions.


Eating regular, consistent meals helps provided a steady supply of fuel to your body and brain. Skipping meals or allowing too much time between meals will cause a drop in blood sugar can make you feel tired, mentally foggy and have poor concentration.Some dining halls offer grab and go options when you are pressed for time.
How often you eat or when you eat will most likely be determined by your class and activity schedule. Determine what meals you can eat at home, at dining halls, or where you'll need to pack a meal or snack.
You may also want to write a meal plan to help keep you on schedule throughout the week. That way you'll know to which classes you'll need to bring a pre-packed snack or when you can grab a quick meal at a dining hall.
Keep track of long classes or study sessions. Be sure to take a small meal or snack with you if you won't be able to take a break to purchase food.

, Many colleges offer great dining plans for students. You'll have access to a variety of different foods that will allow you to consume well-balanced meals most days. When you're choosing your meals, make sure to include:


Lean protein. Protein helps fuel your body, keep you satisfied and support weight loss or weight maintenance.Lean protein foods include: poultry, eggs, lean beef, low-fat dairy, tofu, nuts and legumes. Pick items that are not fried or cooked in a lot of butter or oil to help minimize your calorie intake.
Fruits and vegetables. These foods contain very little calories are are an essential part to a healthy diet. They provide most of the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day and include a variety of different colors as well.
Whole grains. When you're choosing grains, aim to pick items that are 100% whole grain. They have more fiber and other nutrients compared to refined grains like white bread or plain pasta.Choose items like: brown rice, quinoa, or 100% whole bread and pasta.

, If you can, stock your dorm room with healthy foods for quick meals and snacks. Even if you're on a meal or dining plan, having healthy options stocked at home can help keep you on track with your diet.


If you have a small refrigerator in your room, keep healthy items like these on hand: low-fat cheese sticks, low-fat yogurts or individual cottage cheese cups, cut up raw vegetables, low-fat salad dressings, hummus and low-fat deli meat.
Also stock dry goods and shelf-stable items in your dorm like: individual oatmeal packs, high fiber/high protein cereal, whole wheat bread/wraps, nut butters, high protein bars, low-fat/low-sodium canned soups and nuts.

, Aim to consume at least 64 oz or about 2 L of water daily.Carrying around a reusable water bottle can help keep water handy and help you reach your goal each day.


Other fluids that can help maintain proper hydration include: sugar-free flavored waters, sugar-free flavored powders, decaf coffee and tea and no calorie sports drinks.

, It can be difficult to choose healthy foods all the time in college. There are a lot of tempting foods at dining halls, parties, and study groups. Choosing wisely when you consume these higher fat, higher calorie foods can help minimize weight gain.


When you can, have a say in what's ordered or bring a healthy option at potluck style parties. For example, bring a fruit salad or veggie tray to a party.
Other ways to make junk food a little healthier include: ordering a pizza with a thin crust, 1/2 the amount of cheese and extra vegetables; ordering a kids meal at a fast food restaurant instead of an adult meal; indulging in a higher calorie entree like a burger, but ask for a salad instead of fries; or order an appetizer or half size portion.

, Alcohol is a common source of extra calories for college students. In addition, these extra calories are ""empty calories"" that provide no nutrition for your body.If you're 21, choose lower calorie alcoholic beverages like: low-calorie or low-carb beers, wine or mixed drinks made with 1 ounce of liquor and without juices or other sweetened beverages. These items have about 100 calories per serving.Drinks to stay away from include: higher calorie beers, wine spritzers, and mixed drinks.
If you're of legal age to drink, women should consume no more than one alcoholic beverage a day and men should consume no more than two alcoholic beverages daily.In addition, alcohol inhibits your senses and ability to make good decisions. This may lead to eating high fat junk foods., Many college students are up late into the night studying or coming home from social activities. Since it might have been awhile since your last meal, it can be tempting to snack or eat again prior to going to sleep.


This additional meal or snack can add a significant amount of calories to your day and cause weight gain or slow weight loss.Try to skip this late night snack or meal altogether. If you can't, take a small portion of food or choose a healthy option. For example, if everyone's ordering pizza, eat only one slice or choose a healthy option you have stocked at your dorm room (like a cheese stick and an apple).
Keep healthy snacks in a backpack or purse, like a granola bar, cheese and crackers, etc.
Eat enough before you head out for the night. It might be tempting to skimp on dinner, however that may lead to snacking later one if you go out on an empty stomach.

, Many colleges offer PE classes as courses you can sign up for. Many times, these PE classes teach you about physical activity, different types of activities, and how to do them safely.


PE classes will generally include both cardio, strength training, and stretching. They are well-rounded and a good place for beginners or those wanting to learn more about physical activity.
Common PE classes offered by colleges include: weight lifting, dance, martial arts, aquatic exercises, yoga, and basic or intro classes., Take advantage of your school's gym. It's likely that your school has an expansive and free gym for you to use. Check out the treadmills, ellipticals, pools, or any other features of your school's gym.


Do both cardio and strength training activities during the week. You should aim for 150 minutes of cardio each week and two days of strength training.If your college doesn't have a gym or offer aerobic classes, many local gyms give discounts to students with a valid student ID.

, Many schools offer additional ways to be active and socialize. Joining a club or intramural sports team may provide a more fun and enjoyable outlet to be active.Refer to the student activities page or club listings to find more information about different sports teams that are offered. There may be more than one per sport to cater to a variety of skill levels.
Typical sports clubs offered include: soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, and even skiing.

, One easy way to get in some extra physical activity is walking to and from classes. If you can and it's safe, take longer pathways to class or skip driving or taking the bus to class.


You can also consider purchasing a pedometer to see how many steps you take in a day. Take this opportunity to plan additional steps into your routine.

, If you can't make it to the gym or walk a longer pathway to class, try working out in your dorm room. There are a variety of exercises you can do in a small space with limited or no extra equipment.


Get a set of resistance bands or light weight dumb bells (these can be purchased fairly inexpensively). There are a variety of exercises you can do with this equipment to help work up a sweat and build lean muscle mass.Exercises to try include: lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, bicep curls, shoulder raises, or tricep dips.
Cardio activities can include: lunges, jumping jacks, knee raises, or running in place.
You can also find a variety of free, online cardio videos that require little to no equipment or space.
Try alternating between some cardio activities and strength training activities for a well-rounded workout., Maintaining a healthy diet or weight loss plan in college can be difficult. This is especially true if friends are not following a healthy diet or lifestyle. Speaking to a therapist on campus might provide you with additional support and confidence to maintain your healthy eating plan.


Many colleges offer free or very reasonably priced counseling to their students. Contact your campus health department to find out what type of services are offered and their price.
Talk to a behavior therapist about your healthy eating plan, any barriers you have, and what difficulties you're having. They'll be able to coach, guide, and support you.

, Sleeping is very important to a healthy weight and helps support weight loss.Try going to bed early enough that you can get a solid seven to nine hours of sleep prior to waking up for your first class.


Adequate sleep also helps with memory, your ability to retain and recall new information, and may help improve your study habits and grades., Whether it's exams, living in close quarters with roommates, or tough classes, there are a variety of reasons for high stress levels in college. It's important to manage and address your stress, as high levels of stress may cause increased snacking or the consumption of high-fat foods.If you're noticing increased stress, try to relax and self-soothe with restorative activities like: yoga, meditation, exercise, talking to a friend or therapist, or listening to music.
If you notice you're reaching for food when you're stressed, try to go for healthier snacks instead. Try: raw carrots and hummus, an apple with peanut butter, or a small greek yogurt.

, College is a great place to find a variety of friends that share common interests with you. In addition, many other students might be fighting the same ""freshman 15"" and will want to get on a healthy eating plan.


Studies have shown that those who have a solid support group have an easier time losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term. They provide you the encouragement and motivation to stay on track.Ask friends or roommates if they'd be interested in eating healthy with you and being more active. Working as group can be more fun and enjoyable.
Also check your campus clubs or group listing to see if there are any clubs that focus on healthy eating, nutrition, or physical activity.

To help make your transition to this diet a little easier, write out your meal plan and a corresponding grocery list.Start by reviewing the allowed foods for whatever phase you're following. Also review the corresponding recipes that incorporate these allowed foods.
To make your meal plan, take a calendar or date book and write in what you plan to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and any planned snacks. Do this for one week at a time.
Review your meal plan and recipes and write up a corresponding grocery list. This will help keep you on track in the grocery store and prevent you from purchasing things you don't need.

, In addition to following a specific eating plan in the 20/20 diet, Dr. Phil also suggests setting up an exercise schedule. He gives some specifics in the diet to help support your weight loss.


The first thing to do is to get clearance from your doctor. The diet recommends this and it's a general safety practice you should always follow. You need to make sure exercise is safe and appropriate for you.
Consider joining an exercise program at a gym, working with a personal trainer, buy some fitness DVDs or watch them for free online, or just start walking for 30 minutes every day.
As you become more familiar with which exercises you enjoy, try to write out an exercise schedule for yourself week by week (you can ask a trainer to help you with this, too). It should be similar to your meal plan. Write out what type of exercise you want to do and for how long on each day of the week.
In phase one, it's recommended to start by increasing your steps and overall endurance. This is especially important if you haven't been overly active previously.However, if you're already in fairly good shape, Dr. Phil recommends that you start the 30 second exercise plan, which is detailed in his book. This is where you do 30 second bursts of very high-intensity activity alternating with lower intensity exercises.

, In addition to the 20/20 book, there is also an app that you can download to your smartphone or tablet. This is an extra resource that may prove to be useful as well.


The 20/20 app is available for both iPhone and Android devices. It's free to install with both.The app provides a lot of the same information as the book; however, the sources are less robust as is the overall content.
You can find information on each of the phases, lists of allowed foods and a variety of recipes on the app.
The app also has information on performing the recommended exercises.

, To start off your weight loss on the 20/20 diet, you'll begin by entering phase one or the ""five day boost"" phase. The goal here is to help kick start your weight loss.The five day boost phase is the most restrictive part of the 20/20 diet. There is only a small list of foods that are allowed at this time. All are whole foods which are not processed and are naturally lower in carbohydrates.
Start by gathering the list of foods that are allowed during this phase. They include: coconut oil, green tea, mustard, olive oil, almonds, apples, chickpeas, dried plums, prunes, leafy greens, lentils, peanut butter, pistachios, raisins, yogurt, eggs, cod, rye, tofu and whey powder.
During this kick start phase, you'll need to eat four meals a day about four hours apart. Writing yourself a meal plan will help you stick to this schedule.
If you purchase the 20/20 diet book, there are recipes provided for this specific phase.

, After you move through the five days of the boost phase, you'll enter phase two which is called the ""five day sustain"" phase. You'll continue your weight loss, but are now able to eat a wider variety of foods.In phase two, there are additional foods that you can eat; however, you need to continue with your current eating plan. Aim to have four meals a day about four hours apart.
In addition to the approved 20 foods, you can also add: chicken breast, tuna, oats, brown rice, carrots, tomatoes, mushrooms, cashews, and blueberries.
At each meal, you can add some of these new foods, however you still need to include two of the original 20 approved foods. This helps continue your weight loss.
Another addition that you can do during this second phase is to incorporate two ""sensible splurges"" each week. These splurges need to be calorie controlled and total no more than 100 calories per splurge.

, Phase three or the 20 day attain phase is very similar to phase two. You do get to add in more foods and your main goal is to work towards attaining your goal weight.In this last weight loss phase of the 20/20 diet, you are able to add in even more foods. These include: avocado, raspberries, mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, quinoa, and black beans. They include more carbohydrate rich foods, but are still very nutritious and low in calories.
Again, the eating plan doesn't change. You're to aim for four meals about four hours apart and can still include the two ""sensible splurges"" for 100 calories each.

, After the first three phases, you probably will have lost a significant amount of weight; however, to decide whether or not you should transition to maintenance, decide whether you want to continue with further weight loss.


The 20/20 diet recommends that you evaluate your weight after phase three comes to an end. Do you still want to lose more weight? Or are you content with your current weight loss?
If you'd like to lose more weight, it's recommended that you restart from phase one and go through all three phases again. Repeat this sequence until you've hit your desired goal weight.If you're content with your weight loss, you can transition to phase four which focuses mostly on weight maintenance.

, The last and final phase of the 20/20 diet is the maintenance phase. This is the final phase and the habits and eating patterns you've adopted shouldn't change.


In order to prevent you from regaining the weight, the 20/20 diet recommends that you stay in phase three (with the occasional sensible splurge) long-term.
You're encouraged to continue trying new recipes and monitoring your diet so that you stay on track with the four meals daily about four hours apart.
Another important phase of maintenance is the continued work on your relationship with food and managing your desires to eat.

, When you've hit your goal weight after following the 20/20 diet, there are many lifestyle habits that you'll need to continue in order to maintain that weight. One of the is regular and consistent physical activity.


Research shows that one of the best ways to maintain a healthy weight or a weight loss is by including regular physical activity.The 20/20 diet in addition to most health professionals will recommend that you include at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity each week. Also include one to two days of strength training in addition to your cardio.
For cardio, you can try: the 20/20 diet's high-intensity interval training program, running, walking, using the elliptical, hiking, dancing or taking a spin class. For resistance training, try: lifting weights or taking a yoga or pilates class.

, One place that many dieters slip up, is when they increase how much they snack or cheat during their maintenance phase. Too much of this behavior can cause weight regain.


The 20/20 diet specifically emphasizes that you should monitor your splurges and cheats. It allows you two sensible splurges long-term, so use those wisely and make sure you stay accountable to those two splurges.You may want to keep a food journal or diary during your maintenance phase. This can help you plan for and remember splurges so that you don't overdo it.
If you do notice some weight regain, one of the first places you should evaluate is the amount of splurges you've been having.

, One unique aspect of the 20/20 diet is the emphasis on emotional eating and your relationship with food. It suggests continually monitoring this relationship and to work on controlling your cravings and desires to eat when you're feeling upset.The 20/20 diet says that your emotions play a big part in how much you eat and what you choose to eat. You need to continue to be aware of this so you don't fall back into old habits.
The book associated with this particular diet gives a lot of great advice and tips on how to continually manage this aspect of your weight loss.
For example, if you have a craving for junk food, try drinking a glass of water and going on a walk to help distract you from the craving. Or you could brush your teeth, which might keep you from indulging (and help support your oral health!).

, In addition to regular exercise and sticking to a sensible eating plan long-term, it's also recommended that you weigh yourself regularly and to track your weight long-term.


The 20/20 book and many health professionals note that when you weigh in regularly and keep track of your weight, you're more likely to continue losing weight and have a much better time maintaining your weight loss.Try to get on the scale one time per week, long-term. Weighing daily isn't necessary since day to day fluctuations in weight are common and don't necessarily reflect an accurate overall trend.
If you notice your weight creeping up over time, revisit your exercise schedule and food journal to see what's causing your weight gain. You'll need to adjust what you're eating so your weight starts to go back down.

Remove your makeup.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Try eye cream.,
Wear concealer.,
Make a cold compress.,
Use cucumbers.,
Use potatoes.,
Use old tea bags.",How to Reduce Bags Under Your Eyes1," Leaving on your makeup when you sleep can cause your eyes to water. It can also clog the pores under your eyes, increasing puffiness and the appearance of bags. Wash your face before bed, either with soap and water or makeup remover. Your face will have clean, open pores and the skin around your eyes will retain less water., Wearing sunscreen at the beach is a given, but it's easy to forget that your face is exposed to the sun's harmful rays on a daily basis. The rest of your skin may be covered, but your face remains exposed every day. Too much sun can cause the area around your eyes to sag and wrinkle into bags. Try wearing a moisturizer or foundation that has SPF in it. You can also wear sunglasses or hats to help keep the sun off of your eyes., There are a ton of eye creams out there that are for the reduction of eye bags. The moisturizers are specifically geared toward the sensitive skin around your eyes and have vitamins and nutrients that help reduce the bags under your eyes. They also have the added benefit of preventing wrinkles, reducing redness and puffiness, and helping with dark circles. Try out a few brands to see which one works best for your skin.


There are some people that say using hemorrhoid cream will help prevent under eye bags by shrinking the blood vessels. Avoid this method because it can irritate the sensitive skin under your eyes. Instead, try a retinol cream. It also helps reduce eye bags without the added skin irritation., If you haven't found a way to prevent under eye bags that works for you just yet or if they are hereditary, try hiding them with concealer. Buy a brand that works with your skin and that matches your skin tone. Apply it gently under your eyes, patting it into your skin. Try not to rub it in, which can irritate the skin under your eyes.You can also buy foundation that has concealer in it. It will also help hide the appearance of under eye bags and blend the skin under your eyes in with the rest of your face.Make sure you don't wear a concealer that is lighter than your skin tone. This will call attention to your bags and defeat the purpose of the concealer., Cold water can do wonders to re-hydrate your skin and help reduce the swelling of your eye bags. It can also constrict the blood vessels under your eyes, reducing puffiness. A cold compress is a great method to administer this. Wet a clean washcloth with cool or cold water. While sitting up, let the compress sit over your eyes, applying gentle pressure. You can also dab the damp rag around your eyes. Do this for 5-10 minutes.You can get a similar effect with cold spoons. Stick two spoons in the freezer for about an hour. Take them out and gently massage them under your eyes, being careful not to poke your eye. The coldness helps constrict the blood vessels under your eyes and the massaging helps reduce swelling., Putting slices of cucumbers on your eyes is a time honored method of bag reduction. The cucumbers have skin-lightening qualities and contain a mild astringent, which can help reduce the appearance of bags under your eyes. The excessive amount of water in the cucumber can help hydrates the skin under your eyes and the coolness can reduce puffiness and sagging. Chill a cucumber for at least 30 minutes. Slice off two generously sized pieces. Sit or lay down, placing them over your closed eyes for 10 minutes. Remove the cucumbers and wash your eyes with water, removing the juice. Repeat twice a day for a week or more for the best results.You can also try dabbing a solution with cucumber juice under your eyes. Juice a cucumber and lemon, mixing equal parts cucumber and lemon juice. Soak a cotton ball with the juice, gently applying it under your eyes. Leave it on for 15 minutes before you wash it off. Repeat daily for a week or more.

, Much like cucumbers, you can use slices of potatoes to help reduce the appearance of bags under your eyes. They have antioxidants and nutrients that, mixed with the coldness, can help educe the puffiness and inflammation of under eye bags. Cut thin pieces of a chilled potato. Sit or lay down and place the slices of potato on your eyes for 10 minutes. Repeat daily.You can also use potato juice to help reduce under eye bags. Grate a potato, getting enough juice to soak two cotton balls. Place the soaked cotton balls over your closed eyes, letting them sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse your eyelids with cool water to remove the juice. Repeat once or twice daily for over a week.

, Brewed tea bags have antioxidants and caffeine that can help reduce the swelling and shrink the blood vessels associated with bags under your eyes. The bags can also help reduce fluid retention. Take used black or green tea bags and chill them in the fridge or freezer for at least 30 minutes. Place a chilled tea bag on each eye, letting them sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash your face to remove excess tea. Repeat daily.Make sure you don't let stray tea get into your eyes. This could cause eye irritation and discomfort.

Apply a cool compress.,
Press a cold spoon against your eyes.Place four stainless steel spoons in a cold glass of ice water; allow them to chill for two to four minutes.,
Cover your eyes with cucumbers.Cut two 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick slices of refrigerated cucumber and place them over each closed eye, making sure to cover the affected area.,
Use chilled tea bags.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes1," Soak a clean, soft washcloth in cool water, ringing out the excess once drenched. Gently press the washcloth beneath and around your eyes, making sure to cover the entire bagged area. Continue for about five minutes.Do this while sitting upright to encourage any pooled fluids beneath your eyes to drain.
The cold compress--and other cooling techniques--work by constricting the blood vessels responsible for discoloration and swelling beneath the eye.;
, Remove one spoon and carefully apply it to the swollen, dark circle beneath your eye, pressing lightly. Keep it there until the spoon warms to the temperature of your skin.Return the used spoon to the ice water and take out a new spoon. Repeat this process with the bag beneath your other eye.
Continue as needed, swapping out warmed spoons for chilled ones, for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how long it takes to reduce the appearance of both bags.

, Relax in an upright position with your head slightly back for about 25 minutes.Since cucumbers have a high water content, they're naturally cool and hydrating, making them surprisingly great at relieving swollen eyes. Cucumbers also contain quercetin, an antioxidant that blocks histamine, which may reduce bags under the eye caused by allergies.

, Dunk two tea bags in cold water, then place them in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to get them even chillier. When they're ready, place the tea bags over closed eyes, covering the bagged area. Lie back with your head slightly elevated and continue treatment for 25 to 30 minutes.Afterward, wash your eyes and face with cool water and pat the skin dry.
Avoid tea bags containing potent spices that may irritate your eyes. Chamomile tea and green tea have natural healing properties, making them ideal options, but plain black tea or decaffeinated black tea would also work.

Include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Protect Your Eyes when Using a Computer," This is usually considered at least an arm's length away from the screen. To make sure your computer is positioned right, try the high-five test: if you can properly high-five your computer screen with a full arm extension, you're sitting too close., Ideally, you should look down at the computer screen at about a 15 to 20 degree angle. This ensures that more of your eyeball is covered by your eyelid, keeping your eyes moisturized and healthy., If you're using any books or papers while working, you can strain your eyes if you don't position them properly. If they're too low, your eyes will have to refocus every time you glance at them, leading to eye fatigue. You can also strain your neck by moving it to look down too often. Reference materials should be located above the keyboard and below the computer's monitor. To help do this, use a document holder or a book to prop up materials a few inches and help rest your eyes., We naturally blink about 20 times every minute, but when focusing on a screen this can drop by as much as half. This means your eyes are at much greater risk of drying out when working on the computer. Since your body won't blink as much naturally, you'll have to be conscious of this and force yourself to blink.Deliberately blink every five seconds or so.
If you find this too distracting, try taking breaks. Every 20 minutes, look away from the screen for 20 seconds. This allows you to blink naturally and re-moisturize your eyes.

, Your screen should be illuminated in relation to your environment. If you're working in a brightly lit room, you can increase your brightness settings; if the room is dim, lower the settings. While the screen should be brightest object in the room, it shouldn't be on the brightest setting in a dark room.Your eyes will often tell you if your screen isn't lighted properly. If your eyes are feeling strained, try adjusting your brightness settings in relation to your work environment.

, Surrounding lights can reflect off your screen and strain your eyes. There are several ways you can reduce glare and keep your eyes healthy.


Keep your computer screen clean. Dust on your screen can further reflect light into your eyes. Dust your screen on a regular basis with either a specialized cleaning cloth or spray.Avoid sitting with a window behind you. The sun's rays will reflect off the screen and back into your eyes. If this is unavoidable, cover the window with a drape or sheet to help reduce the glare.Use lower wattage light bulbs. Very bright bulbs from desk lamps and overhead lights will reflect off the screen. If your work space is very bright, try switching to less powerful bulbs., The American Optometric Association recommends that for every two hours of looking at the computer screen, you should take a 15 minute break. During this time you should blink, close your eyes, and allow them to rest and re-lubricate.This isn't only good advice to protect your eyes, but your health in general. Sitting for long periods of time can be bad for your back, joints, posture, and weight. Use these breaks to stretch and walk around to prevent the adverse effects of prolonged sitting.

, Some glasses are specifically tinted to reduce glare from computer screens. You eye doctor can recommend a good pair of these that will help properly protect your eyes from computer glare. These are available in prescription and OTC versions.Make sure you only use lenses specifically designed to reduce computer glare. Reading glasses won't help in this situation., Eye doctors use this term to describe the adverse effects of prolonged computer use. These symptoms are not permanent and should subside when you step away from the computer for a few hours. They can cause significant discomfort, however, and if ignored can lead to permanent eye problems.Symptoms include headaches, eyestrain, blurred vision, dark or discolored eyes, and neck and shoulder pain.
By using the steps in this section when using the computer, you can significantly decrease your risk of developing digital eye strain. Sometimes, however, the best answer is taking a long break to let your eyes rest.

, Your visual abilities in everyday life influence how little or how much prolonged computer use will affect you. Conditions like farsightedness, astigmatism, and poor eye focusing can make computer eyestrain much worse.The eye doctor can prescribe corrective lenses to remedy your eyesight and reduce how badly the computer affects your vision. He can also recommend different methods of protecting your eyes while you use the computer.

, With the proliferation of portable electronic devices, many people are experiencing digital eye strain from looking at smartphones.You should apply the same rules you would follow when using a computer to anything with a screen: clean the screen, adjust the brightness, take breaks, and minimize glare. In addition, there are a few more things you can do when viewing portable devices.Hold your phone or tablet 16 – 18 inches from your face. Holding it closer puts significant strain on your eyes.
Although many people look at their phones while in bed, this is a bad habit. Remember, if the screen is significantly lighter than the environment, it puts strain on your eyes. Try to keep this habit to a minimum. If you continue doing this, at least put the brightness settings all the way down to minimize eyestrain as much as possible.

, Ultraviolet radiation from the sun can do serious damage to your eyes if they aren't protected. Conditions like cataracts and macular degeneration can be caused and exacerbated by sunlight. Buy a good pair of sunglasses and wear them whenever you're in the sun. Look for an ""ANSI"" sticker on sunglasses to ensure that they meet American National Standards Institute guidelines and screen out the required amount of UV rays., Dirty or old contact lenses can damage your eyes and even lead to vision-threatening infections. By properly caring for your lenses you can protect your eyes from damage.Wash your lenses after every use with the cleaning solution your eye care professional recommended.
Wash your hands before handling your contacts. This ensures that you won't transfer any bacteria from your hands to your lenses. Also wash with a mild, fragrance-free soap. You could also transfer chemicals and fragrances onto your lenses and cause eye irritation.
Apply makeup after your lenses are already in, and remove your makeup after your contacts are out.
Never sleep with your contacts in, unless they are specially designed for extended use.

, Small objects can do a lot of damage if lodged in the eye. Whether you're working with power tools, cutting the grass, or cleaning the kitchen with chemicals, you should always wear appropriate eye protection. This will ensure that your eyes stay safe and healthy., Evidence suggests that it can prevent the formation of cataracts and slow macular degeneration.While most fruits and vegetables contain some vitamin C, the following foods are some of the best sources for the nutrient:Oranges. One orange will provide you with a whole day's worth of vitamin C. It is better to get your vitamin C from a whole orange rather than orange juice. That way, you can avoid the added sugar that comes from orange juice.
Yellow peppers. Just one large pepper will give you 500% the necessary daily intake of vitamin C. These are easy to cut up and snack on throughout the day.
Dark green vegetables. Kale and broccoli specifically are high in vitamin C. With a cup of either kale or broccoli, you can get an entire day's worth of vitamin C.
Berries. Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries are all great choices for vitamin C.

, This vitamin helps improve your vision in the dark. Orange and yellow foods tend to be high in vitamin A, so make sure you get plenty of them in your diet.Carrots. For decades carrots have been hailed as the food for good vision. While they are by no means the only food that will help your eyes, they're packed with vitamin A and are a great food for maintaining eyesight.
Sweet potato. This is another food filled with vitamin A. It makes a tasty side dish to many meals.

, Zinc aids in the production of melanin, a pigment which helps protect the eyes.There are a number of foods that will add a good amount of zinc into your diet.Shellfish. Lobster, crab, and oysters all provide high doses of zinc.
Spinach and other green leafy vegetables. In addition to vitamin C, these vegetables will give your body the zinc it needs to protect your eyes.
Nuts. Cashews, peanuts, almonds, and walnuts are all high in zinc. They are easy to snack on throughout the day.

, These are good for your overall health. They improve nerve function, and therefore help improve the performance of the nerves related to vision. The best sources of omega-3's are oily fish like salmon, sardines, and herring., One of the most common eye problems is excessive dryness. While there are certain conditions that can lead to dry eyes, you may just be dehydrated. Dehydration manifests itself in several ways, including decreased tear production. Try increasing your water intake to see if this helps your eyes feel less dry.

, This includes not only makeup, but also oils and lotions you may use regularly on your face. Eye irritations from these products can progress to infection that might endanger eye health.


Of course, you can wear lipstick or lip gloss, but avoid any sort of makeup that could come into contact with your eye.

, After surgery, your eyes will not be able to adapt to light quickly. Bright light exposure may result in extreme light sensitivity and pain.Because of this vulnerability, protect your eyes from anything that might strain them.


Wear sunglasses when you go out during the day for as long as instructed by your surgeon. This usually lasts from about 3 days to a week, though it will vary depending on the type of surgery. Follow your doctor's instructions.

, In some cases, your surgeon will advise you to wear a shield over your eye while sleeping for a few days to two weeks after surgery. This is to prevent you from squishing the eye or rubbing it while sleeping.

, Wear protective glasses if there's a risk dust particles getting in your eyes. Smokers should try to quit for at least the week, but wear protective glasses and avoid the smoke as much as possible if exposed to smoke., Rubbing your eye could disturb fragile incisions and the surface of the eye. You could also transfer bacteria from your hands.


Your doctor will likely provide eye protection, like a patch of gauze or protective glasses. You can remove the protection to administer any prescribed eye drops.Make sure that you wear protection for as long as your surgeon advises. When you sleep, take care to not apply pressure to the eye and make sure to maintain any special positioning recommended by your doctor.

, Don't surround yourself with too many people for the first few days after surgery; staying home may reduce your exposure to ill contacts.

, Reporting symptoms after surgery and attending scheduled follow-up appointments is the best way to contain potential problems. If common post-procedure symptoms occur but linger, you should still inform your doctor. If possible, record the time that the symptoms began. Inform your doctor immediately if you experience the following severe symptoms:


Cataract surgery: Increased pain, vision loss or flashes/floaters.LASIK surgery: Increased pain or worsening vision in the days after the surgery.Retinal detachment surgery: You may still experience flashes of light, but they should gradually disappear. If you experience new flashes of light, increased floaters or visual field loss, contact your doctor immediately.All surgeries: excessive pain, bloody discharge, or vision loss.

, Stay well hydrated to speed up the healing process. The Institute of Medicine recommends 13 cups (3 liters) of water per day for men, and 9 cups (2.2 liters) for women., In particular, vitamin C helps facilitate healing; vitamin E, lutein, and zeaxanthin protect new tissue from free radicals that can damage the body; and vitamin A is important for vision. The following are the FDA's recommended daily values for vitamins:Vitamin C: 90 mg for men; 75 mg for women; +35 mg for smokers
Vitamin E: 15 mg of natural vitamin E or 30 mg of synthetic vitamin E
Lutein and Zeaxanthin: 6 mg, For example, you shouldn't look at any screens for at least 24 hours after Lasik surgery. Speak to your doctor about screen limitations based on your surgery and recovery.

, Your doctor will usually prescribe one of two kinds of eye drops: antibacterial or anti-inflammatory drops. Antibacterial drops protect from infection, while anti-inflammatory drops prevent swelling.If you have trouble treating your own eyes, ask a friend or family member to help.


Your doctor may also prescribe drops that keep the eye dilated, like atropine, to help prevent scarring of the pupil and pain. He may also prescribe drops to help lower the eye pressure, especially if there is gas or oil injected into the eye during surgery.

, Pull your lower lid down with one finger to create a pocket under the eye, and administer the drop. Close your eyes, but don't rub them. Wait at least five minutes between administrations of each drop.


Avoid touching your eye with eyedropper tip.

, Applying eye ointment is a lot like using eye drops. Tip your head back and gently pull down on your lower lid to form a pocket. Turn the bottle upside down over your eye and gently squeeze it to pour a thin stream of ointment into the pocket. Close the eye for about a minute to let the ointment spread over the eye and start working.

, For example, you may boil water and place a clean washcloth into the water to sterilize it. Wash your hands to make sure they're clean, then run the washcloth gently over your upper and lower eyelids and lashes. Make sure that you also run the cloth over the corners of your eyes.


Wash the cloth in boiling water or choose a fresh, clean cloth before each use. The cloth must be sterile, as eyes are vulnerable to infection after surgery.

, However, avoid strenuous activity like weight lifting, jogging, cycling, or swimming for as long as your doctor advises. Lifting and straining increases pressure in the eye. This pressure can slow the healing process and could even damage the healing tissue.Ask others for help when doing anything too strenuous. Your friends and family will be more than happy to help you while you recover.

, Any sort of strenuous behavior can cause pressure to build up in your eye, slowing down the healing process. Ask your surgeon when you can resume such activities.

, You should avoid driving until vision has recovered or your surgeon allows you to drive. In general, though, you can start driving when your eyes can focus and lose their light-sensitivity.


Make sure you have someone who can pick you up after surgery.

, Some types of surgeries call for up to six weeks of recovery time. Cataract surgery, on the other hand, can have a shorter recovery period of about a week., This, in turn, would slow down the healing process or further injure the eye.

, After cataract surgery, patients often complain of a ""foreign body"" sensation in the eye. This is usually due to dry eye symptoms caused by the stitches or a cut nerve, or surface irritation/irregularity/dryness from the antiseptic used prior to surgery and drying of the eye's surface during surgery.


The nerve takes usually a few months to heal, during which time your eye will feel strange.
To combat these symptoms, your doctor may prescribe lubricating drops and antibiotics to prevent infection., Surgery is required to prevent blindness. Symptoms include painless vision loss like a curtain going down; flashes of light in the corner of the eye; and the sudden appearance of many floaters.


The recovery time for this surgery is about one to eight weeks.
You may feel some pain, after surgery, but it can usually be treated with over-the-counter pain medication or an ice pack.
You may also experience floaters or flashes of light that should gradually disappear. If you experience any new flashes of light that was not experienced before the surgery, contact your doctor immediately.
You may also see a black or silver line going through your field of vision. This is due to trapped gas bubbles; as the gas absorbs in your eye with time, this should disappear., Although the procedure itself is quick, the recovery time can last anywhere from 2 to 3 months.LASIK is a corrective surgery for those who wear glasses or contacts. It is done with a laser that changes the curvature of the lens to allow for clear vision. After surgery, it's normal for your eyes to tear up more than usual, or for you to experience halos or blurry vision. You may also experience burning or itching, but it's important to refrain from touching the eye. Instead, inform your doctor of any problems if it becomes unbearable.


Your doctor will likely plan a follow-up visit for 24- 48 hours after surgery to test your vision and check for infections. Alert your doctor of any pain or side effects that you may have at that time, and make a plan for further follow-up visits.
You can gradually return to normal activities, but follow the plan set by your doctor. After 2 weeks, you can begin wearing makeup and lotions on the face again. After 4 weeks, you can take part in strenuous activities and contact sports.
Avoid scrubbing your eyelids or going into hot tubs or whirlpools for 1-2 months, or as advised by eye care professional."

Reduce your salt intake.,
Drink more water.,
Take care of your allergies.,
Get adequate rest.,
Change your sleeping position.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Stop smoking.",How to Reduce Bags Under Your Eyes2," Excessive sodium in your diet makes you retain water, and the area around your eyes is a great example of this. After a salt heavy dinner, you will find that your eye bags are puffier the next morning. The salt makes water pool around your eyes, increasing your bags. Try using less salt in your cooking and in your diet, using other methods such as herbs or spices to liven up your food., When your body does not get adequate water, it retains the water it does have. One of the places this happens is under your eyes, causing bags. Increase your water intake every day by switching out some of your beverage choices with water instead. This will also help you to avoid excessive caffeine, especially in coffee, which also causes dehydration and water retention., Allergies cause eye irritation, swelling, and sinus pressure, all of which cause eye bags. Most over the counter allergies medicines that help reduce your allergy symptoms will have the added bonus of reducing the bags under your eyes. They will dry up the excess water pooled under your eyes and reduce the irritation that leads to severe eye bags.Make sure you only use this method if you have allergies. Don't take allergy medication just to reduce the bags under your eyes. This method only works if you eye bags are caused by complications due to allergies and does not work as an overall treatment method.

, Fatigue and stress due to tiredness causes bags under your eyes. The recommended amount of sleep you should get is around 8 hours a night. You need to make sure that the sleep you get is restful. Try to go to bed at the same time every night, which will get your body into a better sleeping pattern and will help you to sleep better., When you sleep, gravity causes fluid to pool under your eyes, causing those unsightly bags. If you sleep on your side or your stomach, try changing your sleeping position to your back. Gravity will naturally reduce the amount of fluid retention under your eyes and help with the appearance of bags in the morning.You can also add another pillow to your bed. The increased elevation of your head will reduce the amount of fluid that pools under your eyes., A glass of wine is fine, but avoid consuming too much alcohol. It dehydrates you, which pulls much needed water from your skin. This causes the skin around your eyes to weaken, making the area under your eyes sag. If you do go out and drink, have plenty of water before you go to bed to re-hydrate your skin.


Adding some moisturizer under your eyes when you drink also helps combat under-eye dehydration., If you smoke, you are causing damage to your skin. It can dry and weaken the skin around your face, causing deep bags under your eyes. Kick the habit. On top of the many health benefits, your skin will get better and the bags under your eyes should lessen."

Take an antihistamine.,
Flush out your sinuses.,
Apply an eye cream.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes2," Allergies are one possible reason you might have bags under your eyes. If you're experiencing other allergy symptoms, taking an over-the-counter antihistamine might be a worthwhile option to consider.Similarly, puffy bags can develop beneath your eyes during a cold or sinus infection. Over-the-counter medications meant to treat these conditions may help reduce bags under the eyes, too., If sinus problems cause your puffy eyes but an antihistamine doesn't reduce those bags thoroughly enough, consider using a neti pot to flush out the extra fluid building up beneath your eyes.Dissolve 1/4 tsp (0.6 ml) finely ground non-ionized salt in 8 oz (250 ml) of warm water.
Pour this solution into a clean neti pot, then tip your head to the side and use the neti pot to pour half the solution into one nostril. Tip your forehead lower to help the solution drain out of your other nostril.
Repeat the same process using the other half of the solution, swapping sides to cleanse your sinus passages more thoroughly.

, There are numerous eye creams formulated to help reduce puffy bags. Look for one that claims to be fast-acting for the quickest results.


Retinol eye creams are a popular choice.While these creams work well in the long run by promoting collagen production, they may not provide immediate results.A better option for fast relief might be an eye cream with caffeine in it. Caffeine constricts the blood vessels responsible for inflammation and discoloration.Another possibility would be eye creams with Arnica, a natural anti-inflammatory ingredient., Make sure you're drinking the recommended eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water per day. Puffiness beneath the eyes can be caused by water retention, but dehydration actually causes your body to retain more water.On a similar note, you should also cut back on foods and drinks that may worsen dehydration when dealing with bags beneath your eyes. This includes salt, alcohol, and caffeine."
"
Remove any makeup.,
Sleep with your head elevated.,
Lay on your back.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes3," Before going to bed, thoroughly wash off any makeup you applied to your face earlier in the day. Eye makeup can cause your eyes to water while you sleep, which will increase the amount of puffiness you wake up with.If possible, try to use actual makeup remover to strip cosmetics from your skin before bed. Removers are specially formulated to cling to the makeup particles and lift them away, making them more effective than plain soap and water.
If you don't have makeup remover, though, regular facial cleanser and plain water will still work. Just make sure that you keep washing until all eye makeup is completely gone.

, Slide an extra pillow beneath your head before falling asleep. You could also prop up the head of your mattress or elevate the entire head of the bed. The main idea is simply to keep your head higher than the rest of your body.Keeping your head elevated should help drain excess blood, mucus, and other fluids away from your face, preventing them from pooling beneath your eyes and creating bags.

, If you sleep on your stomach or your side, switch to sleeping on your back for the night. By keeping your eyes facing up, you allow gravity to pull excess fluid away from your eyes instead of letting it gather there.If you think you'll naturally roll back onto your stomach or side during the night, try wedging pillows on other side of your body to help reduce the amount of tossing and turning you can do.

, Poor sleep is one of the better known causes of bags beneath your eyes. Plan ahead when choosing your bedtime so that you can get about seven to eight hours of sleep before your alarm goes off the next morning.Sleep deprivation causes your body to release cortisol, the ""stress hormone,"" which can cause the collagen in your skin to break down. This makes the skin beneath your eyes weaker and more prone to dark circles."

Apply eye cream.,
Cover the area with concealer.,
Carefully sweep on some bronzer.,
Top the area with powder.",How to Quickly Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes4," Before applying any makeup, dab some eye cream over the bags. Give it a few minutes to dry before continuing.Choose an eye cream the moisturizes. For an added boost, consider one containing retinols or caffeine.
Regardless of the type you choose, the eye cream will help moisturize the skin and fill in any fine lines that could otherwise trap cosmetics., Lightly apply concealer that matches your skin tone over the bags beneath your eyes. Use the applicator or a brush to pat it on, but avoid rubbing it into the skin since doing so could cause further irritationFor best results, choose a lightweight concealer with a creamy texture. Heavier concealers can sink into the fine lines beneath your eyes and highlight skin damage.Avoid using your fingers when applying concealer since doing so increases the risk of applying too much. A small, flat brush is your best option., While only optional, adding a bronzer to your cheeks can help minimize the appearance of swollen bags beneath your eyes. Apply the bronzer to your cheeks and blend it upward to the area just beneath your eyes using a standard powder brush.The contrast created by the bronzer can help minimize the appearance of bags without covering them directly. Avoid bronzers with shimmer, however, since these can actually highlight bags.

, Use a brush with splayed bristles to lightly dust loose, translucent powder beneath your eyes and over your cheeks.The powder should help set your makeup and prevent it from gathering in the creases and fine lines of the skin around your eyes."

Get your eyes checked regularly.,
Have your eyes dilated at eye exams after age 65.,
See an eye doctor for certain symptoms.",How to Protect Your Vision As You Age1," Many eye diseases can be treated if you catch them early enough.Having regular eye exams is the best way to detect eye health issues early and get treatment for those problems.Get a complete eye exam by an ophthalmologist once every one to two years. Individuals over 60 years old should have annual exams.If you suffer from autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, Lyme disease, or sarcoidosis, you may need more frequent exams.
During your eye exam, the doctor will check you for glaucoma, administer a test to check your eyesight, check your eye muscles, and check your glasses to see if the lenses need to be adjusted.
During your appointment, make sure that you let your doctor know about any vision changes or other eye problems you have experienced.;
, Pupil dilation allows your eye doctor to see further into your eyes and check for potentially serious problems. These problems are often treatable if caught early, but they are more common as you age. That is why it is important to get your pupils dilated at eye exams once you pass the age of 65.To dilate your pupils, your eye doctor will put some special drops into your eyes. Then, they will look into them while they are dilated.
You should also have your pupils dilated at your annual eye exam if you have diabetes or a family history of eye disease., Some symptoms may indicate that you may have a condition that requires immediate treatment.

Wear safety glasses when playing intensive games like baseball, ball hockey, basketball, and squash. Do your best to stay alert and vigilant with all sports activity, and avoid unnecessary risks., Rubbing your eyes too often can cause them damage in several ways. Since your hands carry a large number of germs, rubbing your eyes can cause the direct transfer of these germs and lead to infections like conjunctivitis. It can also exacerbate pre-existing eye conditions like progressive myopia and glaucoma. Aggressive rubbing can damage your cornea as well.If your eyes itch due to allergies, rubbing them can make the reaction more severe.See an eye doctor if your eyes itch often, or if they itch too much to resist rubbing. You may have allergies or another treatable condition.

Get an eye exam done at least every 2 years.,
Use eye drops properly.,
Get the right nutrition.,
Get more sleep.",How to Protect Your Eyes2," As an adult, you should visit an eye doctor every couple of years to ensure good eye health. If you don't already see an eye doctor, ask your family doctor for a referral, or ask friends and family for recommendations. If you experience conditions like vision loss, pain, or irritation, make an appointment immediately; many eye conditions are treatable if addressed early. Eye doctors will test for disease and measure your visual acuity; they may give you a prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses, or recommend corrective eye surgery depending on the condition of your eyesight., Whether you use artificial tears to relieve dry eyes or medicated drops prescribed by an eye doctor, eye drops are an important part of treating and protecting your vision. While many people have trouble inserting eye drops, it is important to know how to do it properly to ensure that your eyes receive the necessary care. To correctly put in eye drops:Wash your hands and remove contact lenses, if necessary.
Lie down or tilt your head back and keep your eye open, concentrating on a spot on the ceiling.
Place your finger about an inch under your eye and pull downwards, creating a small pocket under your eyeball.
Use your free hand to hold the eyedrop bottle (or eyedropper) downwards over the pocket above your lower eyelid.
Squeeze the bottle or eyedropper lightly to insert one drop.
Remove your hand from your face, gently close your eye, and wait for the drop to be absorbed.

Watch less TV.,
Adjust your computer monitor.,
Be careful when reading.",How to Protect Your Eyes3," Proximity to a TV screen will not cause long-term damage to your eyes, but prolonged viewing of television can still be harmful. Watching a lot of TV (more than four hours a day) can cause eye strain and fatigue, which in turn can cause blurred vision. Exposure to TV should be limited, particularly for young children.Sitting too close to the TV may be an indicator, and not a cause, of vision problems in children.

, It is important to protect your eyes from eye strain when at the computer, particularly if your job requires you to be looking at a computer screen for the bulk of the day. If possible, upgrade your computer screen to an LCD model, which is easier on the eyes than older models. Adjust your computer display settings to reduce eye strain – adjust the brightness to match the brightness of your surrounding work area, and adjust text size to make reading more comfortable. Look up from your screen or get up from your desk as often as possible to give your eyes a break. , Always make sure to read in good lighting; reading in dim lighting can cause eye strain over time.

Whole grains, such as whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice
Beans, such as pinto beans, black beans, kidney beans, and chickpeas
Fresh vegetables and fruit

,


Make sure that your diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure that you are getting as many vitamins and minerals as possible.

, Since these conditions may lead to future vision problems, it is essential that you limit your intake of sugar as much as possible.


Try to avoid processed foods, which often contain hidden sugars. For example, ketchup, salad dressings, crackers, and flavored yogurts all have added sugars.
Get into the habit of checking labels to see if an item has any added sugars. If it does, then look for a sugar-free alternative.

, A high sodium diet can contribute to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for developing vision problems.Avoid adding salt to your food and try to choose foods that are low in sodium to help reduce this risk factor.


Try using a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar to season your food instead of salt.
Herbs can also help to add flavor to your food without adding unnecessary sodium.

Control diabetes.",How to Protect Eyesight with Diet3," Smoking cigarettes increases your risk for all sorts of health problems, including vision problems. If you are a smoker, then quitting is one of the best things that you can do to protect your vision and overall health.Talk to your doctor about options that may help you to quit smoking, such as smoking cessation programs, nicotine replacement aids, and medications.

, Carrying excess weight puts you at risk of developing several conditions which may result in vision loss, such as diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. If you are overweight or obese, then work on getting to a healthy body weight.To lose weight, you will need to create a caloric deficit, which means that you burn more calories than you take in. To create a caloric deficit, you have to eat less and exercise more.

, Drinking too much alcohol also increases your risk of vision problems, especially cataracts.Limit your intake of alcohol to one drink per day if you are a woman and two drinks per day if you are a man.


If you find it difficult to stop after just one or two drinks or if you often tend to binge drink, then you may need to seek help to stop drinking. Talk to your doctor about treatment options.

, High blood pressure puts you at a higher risk of developing vision problems as well. If you have high blood pressure, then make sure that you work with your doctor to get it under control.If you have high blood pressure, then you may need to make changes to your diet, activity level, and find ways to manage stress. You may also need to take medication to help control your blood pressure until you can get it under control., Having high cholesterol increases your risk of developing a condition that may lead to vision problems, such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease.To reduce your cholesterol, cut out or reduce foods that contain saturated fats, such as butter, cheese, and baked goods. Instead, try to eat more foods that contain unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocados, and nuts.

Consider getting surgery for wet macular degeneration.",How to Prevent Macular Degeneration," If you notice any kind of vision problems, have your eyes routinely checked. At the exam, you can discuss how to prevent macular degeneration by reducing or eliminating controllable risk factors. This can help detect and delay any vision loss you might have.11% of people between the ages of 65 and 74 have macular degeneration, while 27.9% of those over 75 have the condition. The following factors can increase your risk for macular degeneration:


Obesity
Non-Hispanic white ethnicity
Cigarette smoking

Chlamydia pneumoniae infections
Family history of macular degeneration
Light iris colors in the eye (i.e. blue or light green)
Cardiovascular disease;
, When you smoke a cigarette, you are exposing your retinas to the toxins found in tobacco. Smoking cigarettes increases your risk of macular degeneration by two to five times.The blood vessels in your eyes are among the smallest and finest in your body. As a result, the toxins from cigarettes can deposit on and damage these vessels more easily.


Smoking can also destroy lutein which is important for the health and protection of your retinas., Overexposure to UV rays are thought to be a factor contributing to macular degeneration. UV rays emit high amounts of radiation on cloudy and sunny days. It's important to always protect your eyes when you're outside. Wear sunglasses that protect against UVA and UVB rays. You can also wear a hat to shade your eyes, for extra protection.Choosing polarized glasses can help filter out even more harmful rays. You can also find sunglasses that have side panels and a top panel to block out even more rays.

, Being obese is a top risk factor for developing macular degeneration. While the exact link isn't understood, it is recommended that you maintain a healthy weight by watching your blood pressure and cholesterol.Eat small portions at your meals and try to eat lean foods and proteins like fruits, vegetables, turkey, and whole wheat products.You should also limit foods that are high in calories and saturated fats. Limit or avoid:


Animal fats
Vegetable
Nuts and seeds, peanut butter
Salad dressings
Junk foods
Dark chocolates
Cheese
Fast foods and processed meats

, It's also considered an antioxidant, which means it helps fight damage to the eye due to oxidation stress.You can take 500 mg of a vitamin C supplement every day or try to eat at least half a cup of vitamin-C-rich foods.Foods containing the most vitamin C include:


Grapefruit
Strawberries
Papaya
Brussels sprouts
Oranges
Green peppers

, Vitamin B can improve eye health, especially when combined with folic acid supplements. This combination is known to reduce your risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. You can take vitamin B supplements, or you eat the following:Fish
Bread
Oatmeal
Eggs
Milk
Cheese
Rice
Peas (for folic acid)
Asparagus (for folic acid)
Brown rice (for folic acid)
Cereals fortified with folic acid

, These work with vitamin C to protect and strengthen your eyes. To get vitamin A, you can take a 15 mg beta carotene supplement or up to 25,000 IU of Vitamin A.To supplement vitamin E, take a 400 IU supplement.You can also get these vitamins through a nutritious diet. Good food sources include:


Vitamin A: sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, butternut squash, romaine lettuce, dried apricots, sweet red peppers, tuna fish, and mangos.Vitamin E: sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach, Swiss chard, avocado, asparagus, mustard greens, and shrimp., Studies have shown that zinc is crucial for good eye health and functioning. Your eyes contain high levels of zinc because zinc can boost the enzymes in your eyes. You can find zinc in different foods, or take a zinc supplement. If supplementing, take 80 mg of zinc oxide and 2 mg of copper (cupric oxide) every day.You can also get zinc from these foods:


Seafood like clams, oysters, crab and lobsters
Beef
Pork
Yogurt

, These two antioxidants strengthen the lens and retina in your eye by absorbing damaging light that can cause macular degeneration.The two foods with the highest lutein and zeaxanthin levels are spinach and kale, also known as super foods. Try eating 10 ounces of spinach and kale per week to help combat macular degeneration.


If you already eat a varied, nutritious diet, supplementing isn't necessary. But, if you find it difficult to eat enough dark leafy greens, taking lutein and zeaxanthin supplements can improve eye health., Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid that prevents eye inflammation and maintains cell condition. When you don’t get enough omega-3, your eyes weaken, which may lead to visual impairment. While you can take omega-3 supplements, it's recommended that you get the fatty acid from foods.Foods that contain omega-3 include:


Salmon, tuna, mackerel, anchovies, scallops, snapper, trout, and halibut

, It's easy to forget to blink when you're focused on something in front of you, like your favorite television show or a project on the computer. Remind yourself to blink frequently. This will help your eyes focus better and relieve any strain you may have put on them.Try to blink every three or four seconds for two minutes straight. Or, practice the 20-20-20 method. Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen to any object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It may help to set a reminder alarm., Sometimes, your eyes just need a rest. Place your palms over your eyes with you fingers extending over your forehead and the heel of your palms resting on your cheek bones. Make yourself comfortable and avoid putting too much pressure on your eyes.Palming for even a few minutes can relieve eye strain and help you blink freely since you won't be focused on something in front of you. Eye strain can also lead to additional problems, such as tension and headaches. Listen to your body, and give your eyes a rest when they tell you that they are tired.

, Imagine that you're looking at a large figure eight. Trace it with your eyes to strengthen your eye muscles, improve flexibility, and take a break from focusing on something. Repeat this exercise at least five times.You can also imagine turning the figure eight on its side. Slowly trace it for several minutes.Your eyes are controlled by muscles just like every other part of your body that moves. Make sure to stretch them out and use them effectively and efficiently, while giving them recovery time when they are overused, strained, or tired.

, Start by sitting somewhere comfortable. Hold your thumb in front of you so that it's about 10 inches (25.4 cm) away from your eyes. Focus on it for five minutes, then move your eyes so that they are focused on something 20 feet (6.1 m) away. Do this for five seconds and repeat this process.


Focusing on things that are different distances from you can strengthen your vision and improve your eyesight., Hold your thumb up with your arm extended as far as it can reach in front of you. Focus on your thumb for several seconds and then slowly but steadily bring it towards your face until it three inches away from your eyes. Keep your eyes focused on your thumb throughout the entire movement. Then, extend your arm again, still keeping your eyes focused on the thumb.Zooming is a good way to give your eyes a break while stretching your eye muscles.

, If you have intermediate to severe dry age-related macular degeneration, talk with your doctor about preventing further eye damage by taking an Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formula. This formula is made up of 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of Vitamin E, 15 mg of beta carotene, 80mg of zinc and 2 mg of copper, all of which are geared towards strengthening your sight. It has not been shown to be beneficial to those with mild dry macular degeneration.


Don't forget to ask your doctor about any concerns you may have about managing your eyesand let your doctor know if you're a smoker. Smoking is a risk factor for macular degenerationand a number of other diseases such as lung cancer., If you have wet macular degeneration, in which abnormal blood vessels grow in your eye, leaking fluid and blood, your doctor may prescribe bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib or aflibercept.These medications stop abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in your eye that cause macular degeneration.If prescribed, your doctor will inject the medication directly into your eyes.In a study, up to 40% of individuals improved by at least three lines of vision in testing, while about 95% of individuals saw their vision maintained., If you have macular degeneration caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, your doctor may recommend laser surgery (also called photocoagulation) or photodynamic therapy (PDT).


Laser surgery: During this surgery, a small beam of light can eliminate leaking blood vessels in the eye with a great deal of accuracy.Photodynamic therapy (PDT): This is a light that activates a drug injected to your eye to destroy the blood vessels. While there's a 4% risk of rapid, severe vision loss after PDT, individuals tested two years after PDT showed a greater reduction in vision loss."

Warm up your face.,
Warm up your eyes.,
Learn to cross your eyes, if necessary.,
Check your form in a mirror.,
Look hard to the left or right.,
Bring your outward looking eye into the crossed position.,
Return to your initial hard left (or right) position.,
Exercise the opposite eye.,
Cross your eyes.,
Lure one eye away with a finger.,
Return to the crossed position and repeat.,
Practice to master this skill.",How to Only Move One Eye," Although this might sound silly, warming up your face will prepare your facial muscles for action. Some of these muscles coordinate eye motion, so by warming them up, you’ll stand a better chance of moving one eye.To warm up:


Massage your entire face lightly with your hands. Rub in small circles. Pay special attention to the tissue surrounding your eyes.
Take a big, wide yawn. Open your eyes, mouth, and raise your eyebrows as much as you can. Now compress these features as small as possible.;
, Now that your face muscles are warmed up, you can do the same for your eyes. Roll your eyes around your eye sockets a few times. Holding your neck still while facing forward, look hard to the left. Switch to the right. Repeat this motion up and down.



Crossing your eyes is another great eye warmup and is useful for training one eye to move at a time. If you've never mastered this skill, the tips in the next step should help., Some of you may have crossed your eyes as part of your warmup, but don’t worry if you haven’t yet mastered this skill. With a little bit of time and effort, you can add this skill to your bag of neat eye-tricks.


Practice crossing your eyes by looking at the tip of your nose with both eyes. Slowly slide your gaze upwards to the bridge of your nose while maintaining the inward direction of your gaze.
Hold a pen at arm’s length directly in between both eyes. Focus on the pen and slowly draw it to your face until it is 2 – 4 inches (5.1 – 10.2 cm) away. At this distance, your eyes should cross.
These techniques can exercise infrequently used muscles, which may cause fatigue. When you get tired, take a break and try again. It may take you a little while, but you’re sure to get it!, It may be difficult to tell when you’ve finally mastered the eye-crossing technique. Strike a sweet pose while crossing your eyes in front of a mirror. How do your eyes look? If you have any doubts, ask the opinion of a friend or family member.


When you don't have a mirror or another person available to help check your form, snap a selfie to evaluate your eye-crossing endeavors.
Being able to cross your eyes will likely help you master moving one eye at a time much more quickly.

, Alright. You ready? You’re going to do just fine. Look hard to the left or right. Either direction is OK. Whichever direction you choose, hold this position for a few seconds.

, If you’re looking right you’ll be moving your right eye, if you’re looking left you’ll move your left. While holding your inward facing eye completely still, move the outward eye into the crossed-eyes position.Give your moving eye a guide to follow. Hold your finger at arm’s length off to the side and in front of your outward facing eye. Focus on the finger with that eye, then move it inward to the center of your nose.

, You did it! Felt a little weird, didn’t it? Well done, but you’re not finished yet. The more practice you get, the easier this will become, so try to reverse this motion so the eye that moved returns to its starting position.If you started looking hard to the left, you’ll return to this position from the crossed position and vice versa. Practice one side a few times to get the feel for it before exercising the opposite eye.

, You know the drill by now. Since you’ve got a feel for this maneuver, why not try it on the opposite side without a guide at first? If you have difficulty, use a finger guide in the same fashion as was previously described.

, This is the moment you’ve been training for, which means this is the moment your eye crossing training pays off. Go ahead and cross your eyes. Feel free to use a guide, like a pen held out in front of you. Once crossed, hold this position for a few seconds.


This technique is a great way to train better precision control in your eyes. However, it may tire your eyes quickly. Take frequent breaks to prevent strain., Keep your eyes crossed. Now, position the pointer finger of your same-side hand in front of an eye. Without moving the opposite-side eye, focus on the finger with the same-side eye. Slowly move the finger off to the side, following it with the same-side eye.It may help if you position the finger so only the same-side crossed eye can see it. Try positioning the finger in front of the same-side eye and slightly farther off to the side., Just because you won the battle doesn’t mean you’ve won the war. You did great, but now that you’ve got the hang of it, press your advantage. Reverse the luring motion to return the same-side eye to the crossed position.


To ingrain this sensation and motion in your mind, you may want to repeat this motion with one eye before trying it on the opposite-side eye., The more you perform this exercise, the easier it will become. Try it with each eye. Alternate back and forth. Try to move eyes independently without a lure. It may help, when first attempting without the lure, to imagine that it’s there."

Track the length of your illness.,
Pay attention to the color of your mucus.,
Observe your throat.,
Evaluate your fever.",How to Tell a Viral from a Bacterial Infection1," In general, viral infections are milder than bacterial infections, but they tend to last longer. You will feel very sick for 1 to 3 days and then you will start to feel better, but some of your symptoms may linger. Symptoms that linger for a week or more may be a virus.It's important to stay vigilant and talk to your doctor about antibiotics if symptoms last for a while.
Viruses can morph into things like sinus infections or increase the risk of middle ear infections, which may result in you developing a bacterial infection as well.;
, When you blow your nose or cough up mucus, pay attention to the color. While it may feel a little gross, color can be an indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection.Thin and clear mucus is more likely to be a viral infection. Dark, greenish mucus is more likely to be a bacterial infection.
However, mucus color is not a 100% accurate indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection. Make sure to weigh in other factors.

, A sore throat is common for both viral and bacterial infections. Checking for a sore throat is the most common test that will be performed in your doctor’s office to determine if you need antibiotics right away. Certain types of sore throats can indicate a bacterial infection.For example, white spots are generally caused by bacteria. A sore throat without other symptoms, such as a runny nose or sneezing, may be a bacterial infection such as strep throat.

, Fevers can be present in both viral and bacterial infections. However, fevers differ slightly with different types of infections. In bacterial infections, fevers tend to be higher. With a bacterial infection, fevers get worse after a few days while they tend to improve a few days in with a viral infection.The normal human body temperature runs between 97.8° F (36.5°C) and 99°F (37.2°C)."

Watch for flu-like symptoms.,
Take your temperature.,
Try swallowing.,
Look in your throat.,
Notice if you’re feeling especially tired or sore.,
Feel for tender and/or swollen lymph nodes.,
Check for a rash.",How to Recognize Epstein Barr Symptoms1," When the symptoms first occur, you may feel like you have a cold or the flu. For example, you may get a runny nose, headache, fever, sore throat, or cough. You might also feel more tired or achy than usual. As you get sicker you might experience more serious symptoms that are associated with mono. , With EBV or mono, you might run a fever of about 102°F or 39°C., Both pain when you swallow and a sore throat that lasts for over two weeks are typical of the virus and mono., About 30% of people with EBV also get strep throat. . Usually you’ll see white blotches on your throat and tonsils when you have strep throat. A health care provider can test you for strep throat and prescribe antibiotics if you test positive for the infection.


If you have both mono and strep, use of amoxicillin should be avoided due to risk of drug-related rash.

, People with mono or EBV often complain of long-term fatigue, achy muscles, and weakness. You might also feel a general malaise or strong sense that you’re simply not as healthy as usual. If your upper-left abdomen is sore, you might have a swollen spleen., You might have swollen lymph nodes in your neck or armpits. Here are some suggestions for checking for swelling:Feel the area around your larynx and under your jaw. It may be helpful to turn your head towards the side you’re checking or to hunch your shoulders forward. This will relax your muscles. You’re looking for any tenderness or swelling. Enlarged lymph nodes at the back of your neck are very common with mono.
Use your opposite hand to check under your arm. Lift your right arm slightly and feel under it with your left hand. You should feel around the borders and in the middle of your armpit.
Try sitting down when checking your lymph nodes so you’re most relaxed.

, The rash will first appear on your torso and upper arms, then may spread to your face and forearms. You can also develop red splotches on the roof of your mouth. If you take antibiotics to fight any other infections you might get as a result of EBV, you can also develop rashes related to those antibiotics. Rashes in EBV patients can appear in many ways, including: Red spots that look like measles
Raised bumps
Little blisters
Purplish

Viral meningitis does not have a known treatment. The immune system is left to fight off the disease which takes approximately 7-to-10 days. However, patients often require hospital-level care for the duration of the illness in order to counteract symptoms and prevent secondary complications.
Bacterial meningitis requires close monitoring in the hospital and is usually treated with antibiotics. Kidney dialysis, ventilator assistance and other treatments may be necessary to achieve full recovery.
Fungal meningitis is treated with long courses of strong antifungal drugs administered via an IV line.;

Reflect on your likelihood of having the flu.,
Think about age.,
Recall recent sinus infections.",How to Tell a Viral from a Bacterial Infection2," The flu is caused by a viral infection. If the flu is going around your office or place of work, remember it's highly contagious. If you've interacted with people with the flu recently, there is a good chance your symptoms are caused by the flu.Keep in mind that there are treatment options for the flu if you are diagnosed and your symptoms started within two days of being diagnosed. Make sure to contact your doctor's office about your symptoms during flu season.

, Younger children are more prone to certain viral infections. Upper respiratory infections specifically are more common in younger children. If your child is displaying symptoms like a sore throat, sneezing, and coughing, they may have an upper respiratory infection.If you believe your child has an upper respiratory infection, take them to see a doctor.

, Sometimes, bacteria can start as a viral infection and morph into a bacterial one. If you recently had some kind of viral infection, such as a sinus infection, you may have developed a secondary bacterial infection. If you have had two illnesses close to one another, you may be more likely to have a bacterial infection.In some cases, other viral infections could lead to a bacterial infection. Any illness that lingers for more than a couple of weeks should be evaluated by a doctor.

See a doctor right away if you have certain symptoms.,
Take antibiotics for a bacterial infection.,
Try over-the-counter medications for pain.,
Stay up-to-date on your vaccinations.",How to Tell a Viral from a Bacterial Infection3," Most viral infections can be managed at home with self care. However, under certain conditions you should see a doctor right away. It's especially important these symptoms are addressed in children. See a doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms:Urinating less than three times in 24 hours
Difficulty breathing
No improvement over three to five days
Worsening of symptoms, or severe symptoms
If you or a member of your household has a compromised immune system, you should be seen sooner to prevent complications.

, Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and will not do anything to stop a viral infection. Doctors may not always prescribe antibiotics, even for bacterial infections, but they may be necessary if your infection is serious.The only way to know for sure if you have a viral or bacterial infection is to get evaluated and discuss options with your doctor. A doctor will collect mucus or do a throat swab and send the sample to a lab. Your doctor may want to test you for a bacterial infection if they believe you would benefit from antibiotics., If a viral or bacterial infection is causing you a lot of pain, ask a pharmacist about what over-the-counter pain medications may help. Make sure you use medications according to package instructions and ask a pharmacist whether they will interfere with any existing medications.If you are prescribed an antibiotic, ask your doctor about which over-the-counter pain medications are safe to use with your antibiotics.

, It is important to stay current with all recommended vaccines as they are meant to prevent serious complications from both viruses and bacteria. Get a flu vaccination to protect you from the virus that causes the flu. While the flu is a viral infection, viral infections can some time lead to a bacterial infection. A flu shot can reduce your risk of developing viral and bacterial infections.A flu shot will not protect from all viruses or bacteria. While it reduces your risk, you may still get sick.
Many people qualify for pneumonia vaccinations as well. Make sure to discuss this with your doctor.
Inform your doctor or your healthcare provider in the emergency department if you or your child has not had routine immunizations. You might have an uncommon virus, like whooping cough or the measles, and will need to take special precautions for yourself and others.

Get plenty of rest.,
Drink lots of water and other liquids.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Try different ways to relieve your sore throat.The methods here can help ease your sore throat and can relieve any discomfort you feel from splotches on the roof of your mouth:


Suck on popsicles, cough drops, or lozenges (try Cepacol).,
Avoid heavy lifting or pushing and all contact sports.,
Visit your health care provider.",How to Recognize Epstein Barr Symptoms2," Since mono is a virus and can't be cured with medication, supportive treatment is recommended. Resting will give your body a chance to heal itself and will help if you’re feeling very tired all of the time.


Try to avoid being completely inactive — move around a little when you can. clinical evidence shows that prolong time in bed might slow down your recovery. Return to your normal activities slowly.
Consider taking time off of work or school until you’re feeling like yourself again.

, Drinking will relieve your sore throat and keep your system hydrated. Keep in mind that your body also needs more water when you have a fever. Avoid drinking alcohol when you are sick and for several months after you begin feeling better, as mono can affect your liver, and the addition of alcohol may cause damage., These can help your headache, muscle pain, and soreness. You can use ibuprofen and throat lozenges to decrease pain and increase comfort. Pain relievers are also effective for lowering your fever.,
Gargle with salt water (but don’t swallow!).
Drink hot tea with honey.
Use an over-the-counter throat spray, such as Chloraseptic spray.

, Strenuous activity can rupture your spleen, which is very dangerous. If you experience serious complications, like a ruptured spleen, you may need to be hospitalized., Mononucleosis may have similar symptoms as strep throat, so it is very important to distinguish between the two conditions in order to get the right treatment. A doctor or nurse practitioner may do a monospot test in their office to help with diagnosis of mononucleosis. Depending on your condition they can choose the right treatment for you. In severe cases of mono your healthcare provider may prescribe steroids to reduce swelling in your spleen or liver; such treatment is needed only in severe cases of mono. You can also be prescribed antibiotics to fight strep throat. Your health care provider might also do blood tests to look for antibodies that your immune system makes in response to EBV and/or white blood cells that your body makes to fight EBV."

Do not share items that come into contact with saliva.,
Don’t kiss someone with symptoms of mono or EBV.,
Don’t have sex with someone with symptoms of mono or EBV.",How to Recognize Epstein Barr Symptoms3," Avoid sharing toothbrushes, drinking glasses, water bottles, utensils, lip products, and other personal items with other people. EBV is most commonly spread through saliva, so you can reduce your chances of getting it if you don’t share these sorts of items, even with people who appear healthy., Because EBV is found in saliva, you can get it through kissing (this is why mono is called the ""kissing disease""), sharing drinking glasses, or using someone else’s toothbrush.

, The virus is also in blood and semen, so you can get it by having sex, from a blood transfusion, or an organ transplant from someone with the virus. "

Make sure you only read books, magazines, and other printed items in bright, well-lit areas.If you are reading content on your cellphone, make sure the screen is bright so you do not have to strain your eyes.;
, Staring at computer and television screens all day can put wear on your eyesight. It can contribute to eye issues like nearsightedness. Try to schedule breaks in the day where you do not stare at a computer or a television. For example, if you work all day on a computer, schedule in five to ten minute breaks every hour where you go outside for a short walk or chat with a friend so you are not looking at screens.
Some studies have shown that spending more time outdoors can help to maintain your eyesight and may also help to prevent nearsightedness. Use scheduled breaks in your day to go outside for a walk or short run.

, If you think you may need to get your eyes checked due to an issue with your eyesight, do it early. Getting prescription eyeglasses early, such as during childhood, can help to maintain your eyesight and ensure it does not get worse. It can also help to prevent you from developing nearsightedness, if you do not already have it.If you already have prescription eyeglasses, make sure you wear them when advised by your optometrist. This can help to prevent your eyes from getting worse.

, Protect your eyesight by always putting on sunglasses with UVB protection when you go outside, especially on a sunny day. This can help to prevent eye issues, such as nearsightedness., Smoking can cause a variety of health issues, including eye problems. If you smoke, try to quit. Avoid smoking to prevent putting your eyesight at risk., Make sure you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables in your diet.

See your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects or symptoms of a possible allergic reaction.",How to Take Cephalexin," Do not take larger or smaller amounts of the drug, and do not take it for any longer than what the doctor has prescribed. Make sure that you carefully read the instructions on the prescription label before you begin taking the drug.;
, Cephalexin capsules or tablets should be taken with a full glass of water. Other drinks may affect the effectiveness of the drug.If you are taking the capsule or tablet form, do not chew or try to dissolve it in your mouth. It should be swallowed whole along with the water., When using the dissolvable tablet, never chew or swallow the tablet. Dissolvable tablets are designed to be combined with liquid before taking the medicine so that the medicine will be metabolized faster by the body.


Dissolve the drug in 2 teaspoons of water. Stir the mixture until it is fully dissolved. Drink the solution immediately.To ensure that you have taken the entire dose, add water to the glass and swirl gently to collect remaining drug, then drink the water.

, Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking liquid Cephalexin. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions. If you are using the oral suspension liquid form of Cephalexin, you will need to shake the container before use.It is also crucial that you take the correct dose by using a measuring cup or spoon. Often the dose is given in milliliters (ml), so a medicine syringe (without a needle) is commonly used to measure the dose. If you do not have a measuring device, ask a pharmacist for one.

, Remaining Cephalexin drugs should be stored properly. Store the drug in a cool, dry place with temperatures not exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). Do not store this drug in the bathroom because the moisture may affect the quality of the tablets or capsules.


Liquid Cephalexin should be stored in the refrigerator. Do not freeze this medication. Throw away any unused medicine after 14 days., Cephalexin may cause an upset stomach if taken without food. To prevent an upset stomach, take Cephalexin with a meal, a snack, or at least a glass of milk. If you still experience an upset stomach when taking Cephalexin with food or if the upset stomach is severe, talk to your doctor about it., However, if there is 1 to 2 hours left for the next dose, just skip the missed dose altogether and wait for the next scheduled time.


Never try to take double dose just to make up for the missed dose. This may lead to overdose and adverse side effects., This drug is known as bactericidal, which means that its primary mode of action is to inhibit or disrupt the bacteria’s cell wall and cause it to burst or rupture.Cephalexin is effective against gram positive bacteria. These bacteria include bacillus, corynebacterium, clostridium, listeria, staphylococcus and streptococcus.Cephalexin does not exhibit any therapeutic effect on viral infection. It is also not used to treat methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)., Cephalexin is primarily used against bacterial infection. Bacterial infections may include bone and joint infections, pneumonia, skin, urinary tract and middle ear infection.


In some cases, Cephalexin serves as a prophylactic drug - meaning, it is used to prevent certain infections. For example, this drug is used to prevent bacterial endocarditis., Taking Cephalexin when you do not have a bacterial infection may reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics when you really need them. Cephalexin may also be less effective if you do not take the full dose or cycle that your doctor has prescribed.Talk to your doctor if you still have symptoms of infection after taking all of your medication., Do not use Cephalexin if you are allergic to it. In most cases, if you have a known allergy to Cephalexin, you probably will also be allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics.Some of the examples of cephalosporin are cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefdinir, cefditoren, cefixime, cefprozil, ceftazidime, and cefuroxime.
If you notice, cephalosporin drugs start with ‘cef’. Remember this and you will be better prepared to avoid this drug.
Also tell your doctor if you are allergic to penicillin or amoxicillin. You may have a higher chance of being allergic to cephalexin., You should not take Cephalexin if you have certain underlying conditions. Some medical conditions or diseases may also stop you from taking Cephalexin. These diseases may include kidney and liver disease, colitis, diabetes and malnutrition. Most of these diseases alter your body’s ability to metabolize Cephalexin.


For example, Cephalexin contains sugar, so you might not want to take it if you have diabetes., There have not been many studies about the effects of Cephalexin on unborn babies. Therefore, it is best to discuss alternative options with your physician if you are pregnant. Cephalexin should only be taken by pregnant women if there is no other choice., If you are taking any other drugs aside from Cephalexin, let your doctor know about it. There is a chance for drug interaction – meaning taking another drug may affect the effectiveness of Cephalexin.


For example, some vaccines that contain bacteria such as typhoid and BCG may be affected by Cephalexin. In addition, some studies show that Cephalexin can interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. So if you are taking Cephalexin while taking pills, you might get pregnant.Other drugs that may interact with Cephalexin are Coumadin, metformin and probenecid., Certain herbal medicines may interfere with the effectiveness of Cephalexin, so it's important to inform your doctor of any herbal medicines or supplements that you are currently taking., If you feel like there is a reason that you shouldn't take Cephalexin, it's a good idea to tell your doctor. Your doctor may either reduce the dose or switch you to a different drug entirely.


Special tests, such as a skin test, can also be done to determine if you can safely take the drug. , It is crucial to talk to your doctor before taking the drug. Your doctor will be able to give you comprehensive and accurate instructions pertaining to the proper use of the medication. Never attempt to self-prescribe Cephalexin or take someone else’s medication., Cephalexin has some common side effects, that should be mild and short-lived. If these side effects become unmanageable or severe, notify your doctor. These side effects include:


upset stomach
diarrhea
vomiting
mild skin rashes

, When taking Cephalexin, you should call your doctor right away if you experience any serious side effects. You or your doctor may file a report with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch or by phone at 1-800-332-1088. These serious side effects that you should watch for include:difficulty breathing or swallowing
unusual bleeding and bruising
sore throat
vaginal infection
wheezing
hives
severe skin rash
itching
painful mouth and throat sores
diarrhea that is severe, or with blood or mucus
dark colored or decreased urine
fever
pale or yellow skin

Reduce rodent habitats around the home.,
Avoid contact with sick or dead animals.,
Use flea repellent when spending time outside.,
Bathe thoroughly and regularly.,
Acquire medication to stop the disease.,
Seek immediate medical attention.,
Isolate infected parties.,
Know if your location has had instances of the plague before.,
Know if your occupation puts you at risk for the plague.,
See if your hobbies put you at risk for the plague.,
Be aware of the symptoms.,
Don’t let pets sleep in the bed with you.,
Wear protection when working with animals.,
Get tested for plague if you travel frequently.",How to Survive a Plague," Plague is spread through populations of infected rats and the bites of fleas that use them as hosts. Eliminate possible nesting places for rodents in and around your home. Tool sheds, brush piles, basements, garages and attics should all be checked for signs of infestation.Rat droppings are often a sign that rodents are nesting in or passing through your home. If you happen to find rodent excrement, remove it quickly and carefully, as the plague bacteria can survive and be passed on through contact with infected feces.
Always wear gloves and some type of breathing protection (a medical mask or tied handkerchief) when cleaning rat droppings to prevent contracted the disease yourself.;
, After an animal has died, the Yersinia bacteria can remain active in its tissues or in fleas that it carries. Stay away from animals that have become ill or succumbed to plague symptoms. Plague may spread from diseased tissues or fluids to a living host.Call animal control or sanitation services to dispose of dead animals. Their technicians are equipped with protective gear and can remove potentially infected carcasses with minimal health risk., Wear a repellent spray or rub containing DEET if you plan on spending a lot of time outside. One of the most common means of plague transmission is through the bites of fleas that burrow into the fur of rodents and feed on infected blood. DEET and other repellents will keep fleas away, and keep you safe.People who hike, camp or work outside frequently, or who live in heavily wooded areas, should consider using a flea repellent.
DEET repellent sprays are safe to use directly on the skin and pose no threat of environmental harm. They work by neutralizing the body’s natural scents, making it difficult for biting insects to detect a human target., Wash your hands and face with disinfecting soap and water multiple times throughout the day, and anytime you’ve been outside or handled animals or animal droppings. Plague bacteria can enter through the delicate tissues of the mouth, nose and eyes. Practice good basic hygiene habits and be aware of risk factors in your environment.As much as possible, try not to touch your face with your hands. The disease spreads easily to sensitive tissues, and you never know when you might have touched something carrying traces of the bacteria.

, In some cases, medication can be prescribed to people whom pathologists have reason to believe may have been exposed to plague. These drugs bind to and eradicate Yersinia bacteria in the bloodstream before it has a chance to multiply. If you believe you or someone you know might be at risk of contracting the disease, talk to a doctor about your options.While there used to be a preventative vaccine offered to defend against plague, it has since been pulled from use. It is uncertain if or when a new vaccine will be formulated., Once an individual has been infected, the only course of action is to treat the disease with powerful antibiotics. Most hospitals keep these antibiotics on hand in case of epidemic emergencies. Do not hesitate to seek medical intervention right away if you’ve been unfortunate enough to become stricken by the disease.Plague is almost guaranteed to be deadly if left untreated, or not treated quickly enough. Young children, the old and infirm are at the greatest risk.
Plague infects the blood as it spreads through the bloodstream, attacks lymphatic sites and can eventually lead to toxic shock and necrosis of tissues.

, For the safety of those around them, people who have caught the plague need to be safely isolated until they receive treatment. Some medical centers are equipped to quarantine infectious disease victims in a highly controlled environment; if getting to a hospital isn’t an immediate possibility, place the infected individual in a separate building or room a sufficient distance away from uninfected persons until help arrives.Contact the Center for Disease Control (CDC) without delay if you or someone you know contracts the disease. The CDC has offices all over the United States and can dispatch personnel to collect and treat the infected party.
Keep a distance of at least 3 feet from anyone who may be infected with an airborne form of the plague.You also might be treated with powerful antibiotics, such as gentamicin, doxycycline ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.

, Breakouts of the plague are more prevalent in rural areas that are overpopulated. These areas typically tend to have poor sanitation and more rodents. Most frequently, the plague affects areas in Africa., Veterinarians and their assistants, who come in contact with animals on a daily basis, are more likely to contract the plague. People who work outdoors are also more prone to becoming infected., Outdoor activities like camping put people more at risk for developing the plague. Be especially cautious if you are in an area you know has been infected by the plague. Take extra precautions not to be bitten by animals or bugs. But also, remember that there are only 5,000 cases of the plague worldwide each year., Plague may not manifest any symptoms for several days. Within a week, the infected will start to exhibit flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, cold sweats and nausea and vomiting. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes become swollen and tender as the body attempts to fight off infection. Advanced stages of plague can cause sepsis, or blood toxicity, decomposition of bodily tissues and eventually death.People infected with the plague might also include cough with a watery or bloody sputum, pneumonia, and abdominal pain.
It is extremely important to stay informed of possible plague outbreaks in your area. If you happen to become sick, you might not know that you have anything worse than a common illness until it’s too late.
As many as 8 cases of plague were reported in major California cities between 1994 and 2006—it is not solely a Third World disease., Because Yersinia Pestis is most often spread through animal interaction, it is advisable not to allow household pets to sleep in your bed, especially if you live in a wooded area or a region where plague has been identified. Your pet may have had physical contact with another infected animal, or may be host to fleas that can bite and transmit the disease to humans.Pets should be inspected routinely for fleas, ticks and other disease-carrying parasites. It is also recommended that pet owners use medicines and oil repellents to treat household animals for these bugs.Dogs may not exhibit any symptoms of illness but are more likely to shed fleas in the home, whereas cats are very susceptible to various forms of plague and can spread bacteria through saliva droplets spread through coughing and sneezing.

, Make sure to wear gloves and use a disinfectant when cleaning up your pet's’ feces. Veterinarians, pest control specialists and people of other professions where contact with living and dead animals is common, such as game hunters, should wear hand, eye and breathing protection when handling animals that might carry the disease.Dead animals especially should be handled only be sanitation experts.

, In impoverished and less developed parts of the world, plague outbreaks occur with unfortunate frequency. Do some research if you’re planning a trip to a country where there is a risk of catching the plague and take the necessary medical precautions. If you’ve returned from such an area within the last few weeks, you should undergo a thorough examination to test for the presence of plague bacteria. All it takes is one unaware person to become Patient Zero in a lethal outbreak.Though there exists no medication for preventing the plague before it is contracted, a doctor can advise you about other ways to protect your health in your travels, as well as areas that you might be better off steering clear of.
Frequent travelers should undergo a battery of tests to screen for dangerous and communicable diseases before and after all journeys to at-risk areas."

Do focus exercises to relax and strengthen your eye muscles.,
Try eye yoga.,
Do some brain-training exercises.",How to Prevent Nearsightedness2," If your eyes are starting to feel strained and tired from doing close-up work, reading, or looking at a screen, take occasional breaks to focus on distant objects and give your eyes a gentle workout. This will not only give your eyes a rest, but it will also help strengthen and loosen your tense eye muscles. For example, try the following exercise:Hold your thumb straight out in front of you at arm’s length. Slowly bring it in until it is touching the tip of your nose, focusing on it with your eyes the whole time.
Move your thumb away from your nose again, but this time extend your arm out horizontally to the right, still following the movement with your eyes.
Return your thumb to your nose and then repeat a few times, each time extending your arm in a different direction (forward, up, down, left, right).
You may wish to spend about three minutes on this exercise, repeating the routine 3-5 times a day.

, Eye yoga exercises are designed to relieve eye stress from close-up work. They can also improve blood circulation to the area around the eyes, and help keep your eyes from getting too dried out. Try a few basic eye yoga exercises every day:Eye stretches: Holding your head still and moving only your eyes, first look up as far as you can. Hold for two seconds, then look down as far as you can. Repeat this process, looking left, right, and diagonally in each direction (up and left, down and left, etc.).
Eye flexes: Relax your eyes and look up. Slowly rotate your eyes in a clockwise direction. Keep this going for one minute, and then repeat, this time rolling your eyes counter-clockwise.
Focus switching: Switch between focusing on an object close up (like text at reading distance), and focusing on something far away (like large text on a sign at least 20 feet away from you). Cover one eye, and spend a few second tracing the shape of the near object with your uncovered eye. Then switch to the far object. Cover your other eye, and repeat.

, These exercises do not actually affect your eyes, but they boost your vision by training your brain to interpret visual signals more effectively. Try a brain-training game like UltimEyes, which has been shown to dramatically increase visual acuity when used over a period of time.Be aware that brain training exercises may make your eyes feel tired at first. However, after a few sessions, you should start to adjust, and these symptoms will diminish.

Get your eyesight tested.,
Discuss reading glasses and contacts with the optometrist.,
Have regular check ups with the optometrist.",How to Prevent Nearsightedness3," One way to possibly prevent nearsightedness is to have your eyes tested for any issues. If you haven’t had your eyes tested in a long time, schedule an appointment. If you notice anything off about your eyesight, get tested by your optometrist.

You can also use the appointment as an opportunity to talk about any concerns about your eyesight you may be having with the optometrist.

, In some cases, getting reading glasses or contacts with a low prescription can help to reduce your chances of developing nearsightedness. Speak to your optometrist about reading glasses or contacts as one way of preventing nearsightedness.The effectiveness of reading glasses or low prescription contacts for preventing nearsightedness is still up for debate. Some optometrists argue that this option will not improve your eyesight or reduce your chances of becoming nearsighted.

, If you already have eyeglasses or contacts, going for regular check ups will ensure your eyesight does not get worse.

Try to have regular check ups with the optometrist every six to eight months to maintain your eyesight.

Know the symptoms of cysticercosis.,
Be aware that symptoms can occur months to years after infection, most often when the cysts are in the final stage of dying.

,
Know that the infection is primarily treated with anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory drugs combined.",How to Recognize and Treat Cysticercosis (Pork Tapeworm Infection)," Signs and symptoms of the infection depend on where the infection is located and the number of cysticerci in the body.


Cysticerci in the muscles:
In most cases there are no symptoms when cysticerci are located in the muscles. However you may feel bumps under the skin.


Cysticerci in the eyes:
This infection is rare. If this does occur, cysticerci float in the eye and cause blurred or disrupted vision. Infection may also cause swelling or detachment of the retina.


Cysticerci in the brain, spinal cord (neurocysticercosis):
The most common symptoms are headaches and seizures. Disorientation, lack of awareness to the environment or other people, inadequate equilibrium, and swelling of the brain (hydrocephalus) can also occur.

;
,, Surgery may be required to treat infection in the eyes, in cases that do not respond to drug treatment, or to reduce swelling of the brain.

Watch out for delayed hearing loss.,
Notice if your child develops problems with strength or coordination.,
Consider CMV as a cause for mental disabilities.",How to Recognize and Treat Cytomegalovirus (CMV)1," Look for symptoms of CMV at birth. Babies who are infected by CMV in the womb do not always have symptoms – in fact, they usually do not. However, If your baby is born premature, born with low birth weight, or born below average size, CMV is a possible cause.


CMV is part of the TORCH infections that affect women when they are pregnant.These infections can cause birth defects and are congenitally acquired. There is significant risk for morbidity and mortality from these infections.
Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Further, there are long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities associated with congenital CMV including the following: cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, vision impairment, and seizures.;
, Small head size, or microcephaly, can occur if your baby is exposed to toxins, certain viruses – including CMV – or suffers from malnutrition in the womb.It occurs due to abnormal brain development, and can be diagnosed by your OBGYN when your baby is born., Seizures are another potential side effect of congenital CMV. Seizures can begin very early, almost right after the baby is born, or they might not start until months or even years after birth., Jaundice, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (also known as scleral icterus), indicates a problem with liver function. The liver is commonly affected by CMV and may also be enlarged.


Hepatosplenomegaly, or enlargement of the spleen and liver, is another concern that may result due to congenital CMV infection., There are many causes of pneumonia, but if it occurs in a baby that was just born it may be a symptom of CMV infection. Pneumonia requires treatment with antibiotics no matter what, but you should ask your doctor about the possibility of CMV infection., Like pneumonia, rashes can occur for many reasons. If your baby is born with a rash or with dark patches of discoloration on their skin, speak with your doctor and ask about CMV., This is also known as sensorineural hearing loss. Some babies who appear healthy at birth end up developing symptoms of congenital CMV later in infancy, even months or years after they are born. Hearing loss is the most common symptom that has a late onset.


Vision loss can also occur.

, Another late-onset problem can be the development of muscle weakness. Due to problems with brain development, poor coordination can occur late. If your child begins to stumble often, drop objects more often, or becomes unable to lift things they used to be able to, see a doctor right away.

, CMV infection can, in infancy or after several years, cause intellectual delay or disabilities. It’s important to take your child to the pediatrician regularly to ensure they are reaching appropriate stages of growth and development.

Refrain from sharing personal care items.,
Avoid infected objects.,
Keep your wounds covered.,
Protect yourself from infected people.,
Clean your home.,
Clean sports equipment.,
Replace tampons often.,
Wash clothing in hot water.,
Carry hand sanitizer with you.",How to Prevent Staph Infection1," Wash your hands often with lots of soap and water. Make sure you wash your hands after you sneeze and cough. The entire procedure takes only about a minute. Following proper handwashing procedure can help reduce the spread of germs.First, wet your hands. Then, use enough soap to cover your entire hand up to at least your wrists.
Rub your hands together, palm to palm. Wash the back of your left hand with the palm of your right hand, then do the same for the other side.
Spread your fingers and rub your palms together with the fingers interlaced, washing the webs between the fingers. Interlock your fingers so that the backs of the fingers are against the palm of the opposite hand and rub.
Grab your right thumb with your left hand and wash, using a circular motion. Repeat using your right hand to grab your left thumb. Bring your fingers together and use the right hand to rub the central part of the left hand and vice versa.
Rinse well with warm water. Dry your hands thoroughly with either a single paper towel or a clean cotton towel that only you use. Use the towel to turn off the water.;
, Do not share any personal care items such as razors, towels, cosmetics, and handkerchiefs. This can spread the staph bacteria., Do not touch any potentially infected objects. These objects include kleenex, towels, clothing, bandages, and athletic equipment. If you have to touch these items, make sure you are wearing gloves., If you have a cut or abrasion, keep it covered with a bandage. Make sure you use a clean, sterile bandage. This is especially important when you go out because you may come in contact with a carrier.Keep all wounds covered when playing sports.

, If someone near you has a cough, cold, or is sneezing, ask him to wear a mask. If the person has an obvious skin infection, ask him to cover the infected area with a bandage. Stay away from close physical contact.If you have a cough, cold, are sneezing, or have an infection, wear a mask and cover the infected area with a bandage. Make sure not to spread germs to others. Stay away from close physical contact.

, At home, clean any surfaces that may have come into contact with contaminated materials. Clean with a 10% bleach solution for one to five minutes.When making a bleach solution, just add bleach to water to dilute it. Add ¾ cup of bleach to one gallon of water.

, If you are an athlete, you can spread staph through athletic equipment. Make sure to clean any shared sports equipment with an antiseptic or antiseptic wipes. Place a protective cloth layer between the equipment and your skin. Don’t share medical equipment, like bandages, braces, or splints.Shower after exercising.
Cover wounds with bandages when playing sports.
Don’t use whirlpools if someone with an open sore has used it.

, Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is associated with tampon use and is caused by the staph bacteria. If you use tampons, use low absorbency tampons and replace every three to four hours., Staph bacteria may be on clothing or bedding that hasn’t been washed properly. Wash all clothing and bedding in as hot water as possible. Use bleach on bleach-safe materials and use an oxidizing agent such as Oxy-Clean on items that are not bleach-safe.Placing the clothes in the dryer is better than air drying and may kill some additional bacteria, though they may survive the dryer.

, If you are unable to properly wash your hands, use a hand sanitizer. Make sure that it contains at least 62% alcohol.You can find alcohol content on the label.

Get tested for CMV if you have mono-like symptoms.,
Notice if your vision is changing.,
Test for CMV if you see blood in your stool.,
Be wary of lung infections.,
Watch out for signs of liver problems.,
Suspect CMV infection if you develop seizures or feel confused.",How to Recognize and Treat Cytomegalovirus (CMV)2," People with weakened immunity who get CMV infection usually present with symptoms very similar to mononucleosis, or “mono.” Mono is caused by the similar Epstein-Barr Virus. Fatigue, body aches, fever, sore throat, headache, swollen glands in the neck, and enlarged spleen are tell-tale signs., Infection with CMV can cause loss of vision in immunocompromised adults, and can even lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is a well known complication of CMV infection in those with HIV. Make sure that you seek immediate medical care if you experience sudden worsening of vision., CMV infection can cause ulcers in the stomach and intestines. You might see blood in your stool if this is the case, and may have stomach pain after eating. Diarrhea is also common with CMV infection.Losing blood through ulcers in the digestive tract can lead to anemia, or low iron. It’s common to experience fatigue if you’re anemic.
CMV colitis is uncommon in immunocompetent patients. It is usually a reactivation of latent CMV in those with weakened immune systems.

, CMV can cause pneumonia, severe infection in the lung or lungs, in people with compromised immunity. There are many other causes in this population, as well, but be sure to get tested for CMV if you develop pneumonia.


Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss., Like in newborns, it is possible for adults to become jaundiced if their liver is dysfunctional. However, adults are more likely to experience inflammation of the liver due to CMV, which causes the liver to enlarge (also known as hepatomegaly). This is called viral hepatitis. Other than jaundice, symptoms may include swelling in the abdomen, nausea and abdominal pain, and itching., CMV infection in those with poor immunity can cause inflammation of the brain known as encephalitis. This can lead to changes in mental status (feeling confused, having trouble staying awake), coma, or seizures. If you have a seizure, get tested for CMV; if you experience any change in your level of consciousness or ability to think, get emergency medical care."
"
Wait it out if you’re generally healthy and have minor mono-like symptoms.,
Seek medical care if you experience severe inflammation symptoms.,
See your healthcare professional immediately if you have low immunity and any symptoms of CMV.,
Get treated with antiviral drugs if your doctor recommends it.,
Get tested for CMV if you’re pregnant.,
Get your baby tested within three weeks from birth, if applicable.,
Schedule consistent follow-ups with your baby’s doctor, if applicable.",How to Recognize and Treat Cytomegalovirus (CMV)3," Healthy people rarely experience symptoms of CMV. Initial infection or a reactivation – the virus coming out of dormancy to cause symptoms – usually presents like mono.Symptoms are usually mild and resolve within three weeks – but have a general awareness of the possibility of CMV infection.


Like with mono, there’s not much to do but wait it out and take care of yourself in the mean time. Healthy people rarely get seriously ill from CMV infection, so you probably don’t need to visit your doctor. Rest, hydrate, and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like Tylenol for aches and pains. Symptoms usually resolve on their own.

, Rarely, individuals with CMV infection who are otherwise healthy will experience more severe illness with potential health complications. This is why knowing when you might have CMV is helpful – you can be on lookout for these possible problems and seek immediate medical care if they develop:Inflammation in your intestines causing fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool.
Brain inflammation (encephalitis) with subsequent changes in mental status.
Hepatitis and poorly functioning liver.
Inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis), which can cause cough, difficulty breathing, and low appetite causing weight loss., Any of the above signs should send you running to your doctor if you have weakened immunity. The immunocompromised should also be extremely cautious even about what seems like low-grade illness, such as symptoms associated with mono. Infection with CMV in this population can be deadly, so when in doubt seek immediate care.CMV is a big concern in those with HIV and weakened immune systems, while it poses little risk to those who are healthy.

, There is no cure for CMV. If an individual does need treatment, the most common medications used are antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs ganciclovir and valganciclovir are being used for patients with weakened immune systems.Researchers are studying new medications to treat CMV, but those are not currently available.


Because of the strong side effects, ganciclovir should only be considered for infants with severe congenital CMV disease. Nursing mothers should stop breastfeeding while taking this medication.
For some, CMV can be life-threatening – newborn babies, children with HIV/AIDS, or those being treated for cancer or having organ transplants. These cases might need hospitalization and treatment with intravenous (IV) antiviral drugs.Patients receiving bone-marrow transplants might also benefit from getting CMV-immune globulin (CMV-IVIG), Most of the time, CMV is dormant in healthy people – which means it is present in the body, but causes no illness. However, because the consequences of CMV in newborns can be so severe, pregnant women should all get tested for CMV. If you’ve been infected and your body has made antibodies, you will probably not infect your child. CMV can cross the placenta, though, so any new infection could be spread to the baby in the womb.If you’re pregnant and have a new CMV infection, or any abnormality is detected on ultrasound, your doctor might want to do an amniocentesis to determine if your baby is infected. This procedure extracts and tests some amniotic fluid from the pregnant mom.See your doctor for CMV testing especially if you get an illness while pregnant that feels like mononucleosis (“mono”) – sore throat, fatigue, swollen glands in the throat, and fever.Breastfeed your baby without fear. It’s true that breastmilk is a fluid that can pass along CMV virus, but of all things breast milk least commonly makes the baby sick.Lactating mothers with CMV can still breastfeed. Doctors suggest that the positive effects of breastfeeding outweigh the possible risks of passing CMV to the baby., Any mother with known CMV infection should certainly have their baby tested for CMV, and since the infection is so common it’s good practice for every baby to be tested regardless. Doctors can test your baby for CMV by using their urine, blood, or saliva. Be sure to have the test done within two to three weeks of your baby’s birth to ensure accurate results., If you tested positive for CMV during your pregnancy or your baby has tested positive, you should regularly see your baby’s doctor even if no symptoms are present. The doctor will need to perform regular hearing and vision tests to make sure no problems are developing."
"
Practice frequent hand washing.,
Limit contact with bodily fluids.,
Don’t share food or dishware with others.,
Get regular CMV testing if you’re immunocompromised.",How to Recognize and Treat Cytomegalovirus (CMV)4," The best way to prevent CMV infection is with good hygiene, so wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. There is no vaccine for CMV, though researchers are testing a vaccine for women in their childbearing period.Be extra careful to wash your hands if changing diapers or are in contact with babies’ saliva., CMV can be transmitted through bodily fluids like saliva. Hence, it is important to avoid touching a child’s saliva or tears, clean children's toys well, disinfect surfaces that are exposed to saliva or urine. You should also use condoms during sex as CMV can be transmitted through semen and vaginal fluids.Kiss a child on the cheek rather than the mouth, especially if you’re pregnant.
Carefully clean any toys that your child drools on.

, As with so many other viruses, avoiding sharing food, drinks, and silverware with others will minimize your exposure to CMV.

, If you have weak immunity for some reason, get regular monitoring even if you show no signs of illness - you want to be on the lookout CMV as much as possible. You should have regular hearing and vision screenings.Your doctor may also want to monitor the level of antibodies to CMV your body is making by doing a simple blood test."

Go to the doctor.",How to Prevent Staph Infection2," Anyone with a serious chronic disease, suppressed immune system, or skin condition is at risk, as well as people who live or work in close contact with others, such as health care, group home, correctional facilities, etc. Those at higher risk for staph infections include people with:Influenza
Chronic lung disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema
Leukemia
Tumors or cancer
A transplanted organ, any implanted medical device, or long-term catheter
Second or third degree burns
Chronic skin disorders
Recent surgical procedures
Dialysis for kidney disease
Diabetes mellitus
Immunosuppressant drugs, such as corticosteroids, who are undergoing cancer chemotherapy, or use injected illegal drugs
Need for radiation therapy

, Staph is spread by direct physical contact with an infected person or a carrier, a contaminated object, or by inhaling droplets spread by sneezing or coughing.A carrier is someone who has the bacteria in his nose or on his skin but does not get infected.
A contaminated object may be a catheter, medical device or equipment, hypodermic needle, gym equipment, telephones, door knobs, among other things.

, There are a number of relatively fast tests for staph infection. Depending on the infection, a skin scraping, blood sample, sputum (mucus from the lungs) sample, or other tissue sample can be tested for staph. Skin infections can usually be diagnosed by a physical examination.


During this process the specific strain of Staph will be determined.

, The strain must be tested to determine which antibiotics, if any, that strain can be killed by. Staph infections are treated with oral, or if there is a serious infection, intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Mild skin infections can be treated with antibiotic ointments. Abscesses are drained. Surgery may be required if a heart valve or bone is infected.


The antibiotics that may be used include vancomycin, linezolid, tedizolid, quinupristin plus dalfopristin, ceftaroline, telavancin, daptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, minocycline, or doxycycline.
There has been a recent increase in the types of staph that are resistant to antibiotics. This is in partially due to the overuse and the misuse of antibiotics., Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a staph infection that is resistant to antibiotics, and therefore difficult to treat. If it is not treated quickly, MRSA can lead to sepsis, which can cause tissue damage, organ failure, and death.Two in 100 people are carriers of of MRSA and show no signs or symptoms, and if a carrier comes into contact with an open wound or if you share personal items with a carrier, you may be infected.People with MRSA skin infections often think they have been bitten by a spider at first. Signs of a MRSA infection include skin that is red, swollen, painful, warm to the touch, full of pus, and accompanied by a fever.If you show signs of a MRSA infection, cover the infected area with a bandage, and contact your doctor immediately. Early treatment is key in preventing MRSA from becoming severe or developing into sepsis., If you are at risk or start to show symptoms, like boils, or they start to spread, you should see your physician. Since staph can be an extremely contagious and serious infection, it’s better to be safe than to have it get worse."

Practice proper hand hygiene.,
Keep your hands away from your face.,
Handle and cook food properly.,
Clean commonly used surfaces.,
Visit only safe food suppliers.,
Try to visit less crowded places.,
Clean contaminated surfaces.,
Wash laundry.,
Keep infected family members at home.,
Cut down on airborne transmission.,
Test for norovirus.,
Notice the symptoms.,
Be aware of the complications.,
Know how the virus is spread.,
Learn if you are at risk.",How to Prevent Norovirus," Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of prevention against the transmission of the norovirus. Norovirus is transmitted via fecal-oral transmission, so washing your hands after using the restroom or changing a diaper is one of the best ways to prevent the disease. You should also wash your hands before preparing or touching food.


To practice proper hand washing, put soap on your hands and rub the soap in. Rinse off the soap with warm or hot water (at least 140 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 seconds or more.
If you do not have access to running water and soap, you may use a hand sanitizer or prepackaged alcohol pads, but these alcohol based cleansers are not particularly effective at killing norovirus.;
, The most common way to contract norovirus is to ingest it. If you avoid touching your face or putting your hands near your mouth, you will be less likely to get the virus.


Keep in mind that you can also get the virus by touching your nose and eyes, so keep your hands away from these areas as well., When you are preparing food, make sure to wash all fruits and vegetables well. Since the virus can be transmitted via infected water, make sure you properly cook oysters and other shellfish before you eat them. They should be cooked at temperatures higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.


You should also not prepare food while you are suffering from the norovirus or for at least two days after your symptoms have subsided.Do not change a baby’s diapers near the same area where food is prepared, such as in the kitchen. Take the baby to a separate room and wash your hands well before returning to the kitchen.

, There are many places in your home that are touched by every member of your family. Doorknobs, counter tops, computer keyboards, handheld electronic devices, and any surface in the bathroom and kitchen are common places where norovirus might live. Clean these areas with household cleaners that contain bleach or with other products such as Lysol.


You can keep Lysol or bleach wipes handy to wipe down these surfaces every day. This will help you cut down on any transmission from your family members or guests to your home., There are certain kinds of food suppliers that may be more susceptible to the spread of norovirus than others. Food trucks or street vendors may not have the best areas to keep their hands clean, so be cautious of these establishments. Buffets are also problem areas, especially since so many people from the general public can handle the food. Be cautious of these establishments, especially if you see people handling the food without gloves.


Fast food restaurants are also known for fast-paced service, which may also lead to poor hand hygiene. The best option is to make most your meals at home, where you can control the food preparation.There are also certain foods that you should avoid when eating out because they are easily contaminated. For example, shellfish, salads, sandwiches, ice, fruit, and cookies are common foods that can carry the norovirus., Since norovirus is highly contagious, you may want to avoid places where crowds gather. Some places are hard to avoid, so taking extra precautions may be your best option. For example, you might wear a face mask or wash your hands right after a trip to the grocery store. Keep in mind that transmission in these places is not common, but if you are worried about contracting norovirus, then you can take extra precautions.Places you may want to avoid include:


supermarkets
shopping malls
crowded parks
movie theaters

, When you or a family member is sick with norovirus, you need to keep up with decontamination cleaning practices. After you or family member has vomited or had diarrhea, make sure to clean the room or area where the event occurred. Vomiting creates a spray of aerosolized droplets that settle on all surfaces. You will need to clean all surfaces exposed to vomit or diarrhea with household cleaners that contain bleach.


You can make your own bleach solution by mixing 5 tbsps to 1 1/2 cups bleach to 1 gallon of water., During the time when symptoms are prevalent, all linens and clothing should be washed. Wash any materials touched by you or the sick family member with detergent in the longest wash cycle available. You should also dry them on the highest setting as well.


To handle the items, especially those soiled with vomit or feces, wear rubber gloves. Pick up the linens or clothes carefully, making sure to hold them still so the matter won't shake off and you don't spread the virus. Walk them carefully to the washing machine for laundering.
Whether you wear gloves or not, always wash your hands after dealing with any linens or clothes touched by an infected individual., Any one in your family who has norovirus should not be out in public. This can spread the virus to others because you are a carrier while you are sick. Whether it is you or your child who has norovirus, the infected individual should not leave the house.


Avoid sending your children to school so they don't infect other children.
Don't go to work or school while you are sick either. You run the risk of transmitting the virus to everyone around you., The norovirus can spread through the air if you are in close contact with someone who has the virus. In order to cut down on air transmission, close the toilet lid before you flush the toilet to avoid letting the virus into the air. If you are comforting someone who is vomiting, make sure that you turn away when the person vomits.


After you've cleaned up after a sick individual, don't hang around. The virus may still be in the air, so clean the area and then go to an area of the house where the infected person has not been.If at all possible, keep the sick individual, whether it is you or a family member, in one part of the house. This will help limit contact with other people in the family and cut down on possible transmission.

, Newer techniques have evolved and made it possible to test infected individual and suspect food with rapid and inexpensive testing. Your doctor can test a stool sample to see if you or a family member has the virus or is a carrier.Your doctor can use the RT-PCR, or real time polymerase chain reaction, or Enzyme Immunoassays to test stool samples from individuals who may be sick. These tests can also check suspect food sources. These tests are sent to a lab and the results are typically available the same day the sample is sent.


There are commercial versions of these tests, but they are not FDA approved.These tests are readily used in healthcare settings, such as outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals in order to check for possible outbreaks of the virus. However, they are less readily used in outpatient setting and occupational medicine settings for food care workers., Once you contract the norovirus, the symptoms will appear in 24 to 48 hours. The norovirus attacks your gastrointestinal tract, which causes nausea, severe vomiting, and diarrhea. It also causes body aches, stomach cramps, headaches, and fever. In children, vomiting, often projectile, is more common.Diarrhea is the predominant symptom in adults.


Symptoms are short lived, lasting only 48 to 72 hours. However, you can still be contagious up to 3 weeks after you contract the virus.For example, one gram of stool contains 100 billion viral copies of the virus.After the symptoms of norovirus go away, you may have some different symptoms such as an upset stomach, constipation, and acid reflux.

, The most common complication of the norovirus is dehydration. This is especially common in young children and older adults. Monitor your hydration levels or your family's to ensure hydration. If you suspect dehydration, seek medical attention. However, the virus does not cause any long term problems in most individuals.


Norovirus can become serious children, older adults, and individuals who with compromised immune systems. In rare cases, the virus can lead to severe dehydration, hospitalization, and death., There are many ways that the norovirus is spread from person to person. The virus is spread via fecal-oral transmission. This means that any contact with infected feces poses a risk of transmission. When people don't adequately wash their hands, their hands are microscopically soiled, which can then spread the virus to inanimate objects as well. Studies indicate that the virus can exist for some time on indoor surfaces or inanimate objects, such as a brush or a glass.


The virus can also continue to live in aquatic environments such as toilets or lakes in which sewage has contaminated the water. This means that contact with infected water can cause transmission of the virus. You can also contract the infection from aerosolized vomit, which can be left behind on surfaces where the vomit was, transferred onto your skin, and then transferred to your mouth through touch.Not everyone exposed to the virus ends up with symptoms. However, these individuals are carriers of the virus and can spread it to others., The ease of transmission, combined with the vigorous pathogen of the virus, make it a specific risk for food handlers. One infected food handler is capable of infecting hundreds to thousands of persons. The CDC estimates that a full 50% of transmissions of this virus in the US occur via infected food handlers.


This is due to multiple factors. Given that the disease has a relatively short symptomatic period and only lasts a few days, many food workers may wait for the symptoms resolve without seeing a doctor. This is because the cost of medical treatment is high and the wages earned by food workers is low. Therefore, the workers resume work while still highly infectious.
In non-food handlers, the infections sweeps through families and close contacts, but infrequently reach the level of a full outbreak."

Notice vision problems.,
Pay attention to oral symptoms.,
Identify muscle weaknesses.,
Recognize nausea like symptoms.",How to Recognize Botulism Symptoms1," Botulism can often cause a variety of issues with your vision. For example, blurred vision or double vision are common symptoms of botulism. You may also experience drooping eyelids.If you notice other symptoms it is a good idea to look in the mirror to see if your eyelids are drooping.;
, Many people who are suffering from botulism experience an extremely dry mouth. They will also have difficulty swallowing or speaking, often as a result of dry mouth., Facial weakness, on both sides of the face, is a common symptom of both wound based and foodborne botulism. For instance, you may notice drooping eyelids, the corners of your mouth may droop, and you may have difficulty using your facial muscles. Severe muscle weakness, including paralysis, can also be a sign of botulism.Keep in mind that neurological deficits are usually symmetrical. If you have a unilateral facial droop (a droop on one side of your face), then that is more in line with something like a Stroke or Bell’s Palsy.

, Foodborne botulism is often accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. This is because the toxin has been ingested and often manifests itself in symptoms related to the gastrointestinal system."

Children under five are most at risk, particularly ages 1 to 2.
It is not contagious in any way.
Boys are more likely, only slightly, to develop the disease.
Asians and Pacific Islanders have higher rates of this disease.;
, There are three phases, each with their own symptoms.

Phase one:

Fever higher than 102.2 lasting longer than three days
Extremely red eyes
Rash on trunk of body and genitals
Dry/cracked lips and swollen tongue
Swelled skin on palms of hands and soles of feet
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Irritability


Phase two:

Peeling skin on hands and feet, often in large sheets
Joint pain
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Abdominal pain


Third phase:

In this phase, symptoms typically start to fade. It can take up to eight weeks before energy levels return to normal.



, If a fever lasts more than three days or if they have a fever and four or more of the above symptoms, visit or contact your medical provider. Early diagnosis and treatment can often prevent future heart problems., Giving your child acetaminophen or Ibuprofen can help ease the fever, but may make it difficult to judge the severity of the fever. You can try to lower a child's fever naturally., Even if you don't think it's significant, write everything down and tell your doctor about it.,, In this stressful time, you might want to bring a friend or family member with you who can remember something you might forget either to tell the doctor or that the doctor tells you., It's impossible to guess exactly what your doctor will ask you, but these are some of the most common:

When did the symptoms start?
How severe are they?
How high has the fever ever reached? How long did it last?
Has your child been exposed to any diseases?

,, Although there is no specific test for the disease, the first step is ruling out other things that it could be. The list typically includes:

Scarlet fever caused by bacteria that often results in fever, rash, and sore throat
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Toxic shock syndrome
Measles

, There are several other tests after that will help narrow it down further:

Urine test
Blood tests
Electrocardiogram (which uses electrodes attached to the skin to measure electrical impulses of the heartbeat)
Echo cardiogram. This uses ultrasound images to show how the heart is functioning.

, This is given through a vein and can lower the risk of further problems with the artery., High doses of this medicine help to treat inflammation, reduce pain and fever, and lower the risk of blood clots. This is a rare exception to the rule about giving children aspirin, and it's important to follow the doctor's rule exactly. Do not give aspirin to your child without talking to your doctor, and do not give them any more than what the doctor prescribes., Even after the fever fades, your child might need to continue with low doses of aspirin for up to six weeks. Your child may be tired and fussy, and his or her skin may be dry for a month or so. Try not to let your child get overly tired. Use skin lotion to help keep the fingers and toes moist., The doctor may recommend follow-up tests often 6-8 weeks after and again after six months, but if you notice any other problems, especially around the heart, take them back to the doctor for treatment and follow-up tests.

It may take a few weeks before your child feels completely well. But most children who have Kawasaki disease get better and have no long-term problems. Early treatment is important, because it shortens the illness and lowers the chances of heart problems. Follow-up tests can help you and your doctor be sure that the disease did not cause heart problems.
Some children will have damage to their coronary arteries. An artery may get too large and form an aneurysm. Or the arteries may narrow or be at risk for blood clots. A child who has damaged coronary arteries may be more likely to have a heart attack as a young adult. If your child is affected, know what to watch for and when to seek care.

Check for constipation.,
Look for lethargy.,
Determine if your infant is having trouble eating and breathing.",How to Recognize Botulism Symptoms2," Constipation is often the first sign that parents notice when an infant has botulism. Typically the symptoms begin to show about 3 to 30 days after the infant ingests the spores. If your infant has not had a bowel movement in three days, then you should seek medical attention., Another symptom of botulism in infants is lethargy or muscle weakness. When an infant ingests the bacteria it can multiply and germinate creating a toxin that interferes with the interaction between muscles and nerves. This makes it difficult for infants to move. Watch for the following signs of lethargy:Decreased movement.
Weak cry.
Flat facial expression.
Muscle weakness.

, Botulism in infants can also impact your child’s ability to eat and breathe properly. For example, you may notice weak sucking while your child feeds, trouble swallowing, excessive drooling, and breathing problems. Your child may begin eating less because they are having trouble feeding."
"
Talk to your doctor.,
Rule out other medical problems.,
Analyze blood, stool, or vomit sample.",How to Recognize Botulism Symptoms3," Botulism is very serious and can be fatal. If you notice any of the symptoms it is extremely important that you seek medical attention immediately. You doctor will likely ask you about foods you have eaten recently and if you could have been exposed to bacteria through a wound.Make sure that you know what foods you have eaten. Pay special attention to any home-canned foods, which can contain bacteria that causes botulism.
Tell your doctor if you use needles regularly. This can often result in wound-based botulism.
Botulism antitoxin is the first line therapy for the condition. Sometimes antibiotics are also used. Antibiotics are recommended for wound botulism after antitoxin, but antibiotics are not recommended for infant botulism or for adults with GI symptoms.

, Many of the symptoms associated with botulism are also common in other illnesses, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, bacterial/chemical food poisoning, tick paralysis, cerebrovascular accident, and myasthenia gravis. As a result your doctor may need to learn your family medical history and conduct tests to rule out any other potential medical issues., In order to diagnose foodborne botulism doctors will need to monitor your symptoms as well as test your blood, stool, or vomit for traces of the toxin. Results from the test can take a few days to receive so it is very important that you fully explain all of your symptoms to your doctor. Your doctor’s clinical examination is the primary way to diagnose botulism."

Acute (localized) infection: Most often confined to a particular location, this appears as a blemish or nodule where the bacteria has entered through a tear in the skin.,
Learn to take preventative measures to avoid the disease.",How to Recognize and Prevent Whitmore's Disease (Melioidosis)," This form can produce:

Fever.
Muscle aches.
May progress rapidly to infect the bloodstream.


Pulmonary infection: This form can produce mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia. The onset is typically accompanied by:

High fever.
Headache.
Inability to eat.
Overall muscle soreness.
Pains in the chest.
Nonproductive or productive cough with normal saliva.


Acute bloodstream infection: Patients with an illness such as HIV or diabetes are affected by this type of the disease. Usually resulting in septic shock, symptoms of the infection vary depending on the site of the original infection. Symptoms in most cases include:

Respiratory affliction.
Severe headache.
Mental confusion, disorientation.
Abscesses throughout the body.
High fever.

Diarrhea.
Pus-filled lesions on the skin.
Tenderness in the muscles.


Chronic suppurative infection: This form is an infection that involves the organs of the body. Generally this includes:

Joints.
Intestines and bowels.
Lymph nodes.
Skin.
Brain.
Liver.
Lungs.
Bones.
Spleen.

;
, Steps include:


Avoid contact with the blood and body fluids of an infected person.
Avoid contact with soil and standing water in areas where melioidosis is endemic.
Wear boots when engaging in agricultural work to avoid infection through the feet.
Do not drink from water sources that are not covered or treated.
Practice proper personal hygiene, especially if your job requires you come into contact with soil or standing water sources.

Speak to your doctor about the vaccination.,
Discuss the possible side effects of the vaccine.,
Get the vaccination.,
Have a proof of immunity on hand.",How to Prevent Measles1," The best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated against the virus. The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles and works right away. It is considered very safe for use on children, teenagers, and adults. Speak to your doctor about getting the vaccine if you do not have it already.The vaccine will protect you from contracting measles, even if you are around others who have measles.
Your doctor may recommend the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) combination vaccine to reduce the number of shots you need to get during the appointment. In some cases, the MMR vaccine is given in conjunction with the chickenpox virus, known as the MMR-V vaccine.;
, Most people who get the vaccine do not experience any side effects. If you do experience side effects, they will be mild, usually consisting of a fever or a rash. Serious side effects are rare, but can include a high fever and temporary stiffness and pain in your joints. Your doctor should outline any possible side effects before giving you the vaccine.Infants older than six months can get the measles vaccination safely.
Keep in mind there is no credible proof that there is a link between autism and the measles vaccine. The vaccine is considered very safe and effective. It is not linked to any serious health issues.

, If the child has been exposed to someone with measles, they can get the vaccination as early as six months of age. Otherwise, they should get their first MMR vaccination between 12 and 15 months of age and a second booster at 4 to 6 years of age. If you are an adult, you can get a dose of the vaccine at any age. Your doctor can administer the vaccine in their office. You will feel a slight prick on your arm when you get it but no serious pain.Make sure you get the proper dosage of the vaccine based on your age and whether you have received one dose of the vaccine already. Your doctor should be able to look at your medical records and determine how many doses you need.

, Once you receive the measles vaccine, get a proof of immunity document to show you are immune from the virus. This could be a written document signed by your doctor or blood test results confirming you are immune to the virus. You can then produce the proof of immunity document when needed.Many schools and universities require proof that you have been vaccinated for measles before you can enroll.
If you are uncertain about whether or not you have had your vaccination, you can get a blood test to see if you are immunized. A less expensive option is to get an MMR vaccination. There is no harm in getting the MMR vaccination if you have already had one."

Maintain a strong immune system.,
Take some supplements.,
Practice care when around people who already have meningitis.,
Kiss with care.,
Wash frequently.,
Keep your environment clean.,
Go for well done with your foods.,
Get a vaccination.",How to Prevent Meningitis," This can be accomplished by getting a sufficient amount of restful sleep, eating a balanced diet and including exercise in your routine at least 3 or 4 times each week. A healthy immune system can help fend off the infections that lead to the development of meningitis, offering the best defense on an ongoing basis.;
, Vitamins like A, C, E and D are very helpful in maintaining good health and decreasing the possibility of developing inflammation around the brain and spinal cord. The B family of vitamins supports the immune system as well as the nervous system, making it even harder for meningitis to develop. Don't forget fish oils and other sources of fatty acids that help decrease inflammation in general and serve as food for the immune system.

, This is especially true if those individuals tend to sneeze of cough without covering their mouths and noses. If exposure is constant, consider wearing a face mask to protect yourself from the exposure.

, Infections can be transmitted via kissing, along with other types of physical contact. Know who you are kissing and that the person is healthy and not likely to pass along harmful germs.

, Get into the habit of washing your hands after working in the dirt, using the restroom or playing with pets. Preventing meningitis involves eliminating bacteria and germs that could be transferred from other substances to your skin and eventually find their way into the body.

, Use a sanitizing agent to treat work surfaces, kitchen counters and other surfaces that people share to help reduce the chances of picking up some sort of infection that eventually leads to meningitis.

, Bacteria is sometimes found in meats that are prepared rare to medium well, increasing the chances of exposure. Learn to enjoy meats that are cooked thoroughly and at a higher temperature for a longer period of time.

, Immunization is one of the most effective strategies in preventing meningitis. Different formulas are in common use around the world. Your doctor can advise which vaccination is the best option, given your current state of health.

Wash your hands often.,
Do not share utensils, cups, or dishes with others.,
Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough.,
See your doctor if you contract measles.",How to Prevent Measles2," Another way you can prevent measles is to practice good hygiene, especially when you are in public places like school or work. Wash your hands often throughout the day. Use soap and water, rubbing your hands clean for 20 seconds or more each time.You can also use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands during the day. Keep hand sanitizer in your desk or your bag and pull it out whenever you touch a potentially dirty surface in public.
Try not to touch your mouth, eyes, or nose with dirty hands. Wash your hands before touching any of these spots.

, Sharing these items can lead to the spread of germs and bacteria via saliva. Spreading saliva to others and with others can increase your risk of contracting viruses like measles. Keep your utensils, water bottles, cups, and dishes separate from others. Do not share them with anyone.You should also avoid sharing lip chap or lip gloss with others, as this can lead to the spread of germs via saliva.

, To prevent the spread of germs, including germs with the measles virus, always cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Do not use your hands to cover your mouth. If you do not have access to a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.Try to wash your hands as soon as you sneeze or cough, especially if you do so in your hands. This will prevent the spread of germs.

, If you start to experience the symptoms of measles, go see your doctor right away and seek treatment. Your doctor will examine your symptoms and review your medical history. They will then recommend a course of treatment and give you the measles vaccine so you do not contract it again.If your doctor confirms you have the virus, do not show up for work or school until you have received the vaccine. Stay home and isolate yourself so you do not spread the virus to others. Once you receive the vaccine, you will be safe to return to work or school.

Get moving.,
Elevate your legs or arms.,
Massage the swollen body part.,
Reduce your salt intake.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Take care of your skin.",How to Cure or Alleviate Edema1," If you sit still for too long, edema tends to worsen, since the fluids sit stagnant in your body's tissues. Getting some light exercises increases circulation and pumps the fluids back toward your heart, helping the swelling go down.Go for short walks several times a day to get your blood moving. A 15-30 minute walk several times a day or fast walking, if physically able, can help the swelling go down.
In between walks, do leg and arm lifts (no weights needed) while you're sitting or lying down.;
, Use a stool or pillows to prop up the part of your body that is affected by edema. The body part should be raised to a level slightly above your heart.Elevate the body part for 30 minutes 3 or 4 times a day.


For severe edema, you may need to keep your body or part elevated while you sleep (a brick or similar wood piece under the foot of the bed might do the trick).

, Rub it in a gentle way in the natural direction of the fluid circulation, towards the heart. If you have severe edema, a professional masseur should be engaged to perform the massage type called ""manual lymphatic drainage"".

, Eating a lot of salt causes your body to retain water, making edema worse. Limit your intake of salty foods such as prepackaged snacks, fried food and fast food. Talk to your doctor about the specific amount of sodium you should be taking in every day.Doing most of your cooking at home instead of eating out is a good way to monitor the amount of salt you take in.
Most recipes will still taste great if you reduce the salt by half, or even more. Experiment with your baking and cooking to find recipes that taste good with less salt.

, A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods can help reduce inflammation. Fish, seafood, fruit, vegetables, nuts, sunflowers, beans, peas, potatoes, almonds, and whole grains are beneficial. Use oils and food that contain omega-3-fatty acids and mono-unsaturated fatty acids.


Eating foods high in B-vitamins and iron can help alleviate edema. Eat leafy greens, whole grains, and sea vegetables.Eat foods that act as natural diuretics, like pumpkin, asparagus, and beets., Scientific studies have revealed that herbs or herbal extracts containing flavonoids may cause a reduction in swelling. Try the following herbal products:


Bilberry extract. Use this with caution if you are on blood thinning medications.Dandelion leaf.
Grape-seed extract.
The following ""diuretic"" herbs can be made into tea by the addition of a teaspoon of your chosen herbs to a cup of boiling water:Horsetail,
Parsley,
Yarrow,
Nettle,
Watercress,
Birch tree leaves.



, The skin on a body part affected by severe edema should receive special care, since it's particularly sensitive. Proper cleaning, daily use of moisturizing creams, and proper rinsing of skin injuries are necessary to prevent a more serious skin problem.

Be cautious when traveling abroad.,
Keep your immune system strong.",How to Recognize and Prevent Rubella (German Measles)," The signs and symptoms of a rubella infection tend to be very mild and difficult to notice. However, its most distinctive characteristic is a fine, pink-colored rash that begins on the face and quickly spreads to the neck, trunk and then the limbs.The rash typically lasts for between 1-3 days, then disappears in the same sequence that it appeared (face -> trunk -> limbs).


The distinctive skin rash only occurs in 50–80% of cases of rubella.If the rash and other symptoms appear, they do so between 2-3 weeks after exposure to the virus.;
, Another common feature of rubella (and virtually all infections) is a fever. However, unlike some other viral infections, rubella only triggers a mild fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or lower in children and young adults.The fever only lasts for about 3 days, but it should still be treated.


As with any fever, it's smart to keep well hydrated. Children with mild fevers should have a small glass of water or diluted juice every few hours while they're awake.
Mild fevers sometimes reduce appetite or lead to some nausea, although vomiting is not a typical sign of rubella.

, Another sign that the body is fighting an infection, especially an upper respiratory one like rubella, is inflamed or enlarged lymph nodes (glands).Blood and lymph fluid is filtered by lymph nodes, which contain specialized white blood cells that kill viruses and other pathogens. In doing so, they often get enlarged, inflamed and tender. Check behind your ears, along the sides and back of your neck and above your collarbones for tender lymph nodules.


With mild acute (short-term) infections, lymph glands only get enlarged and tender for a few days.
Don't confuse inflamed lymph glands with pimples, boils or ingrown hairs.
People of all ages, including infants, will develop swollen glands before the pink rash appears., Other symptoms of rubella tend to mirror those of the common cold, except they tend to be milder. These common upper respiratory symptoms include stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, inflamed bloodshot eyes, fatigue and headaches.Unlike the common cold and influenza infections, rubella doesn't lead to a sore throat, excessive coughing or lung congestion. However, sore throat is a prodromal (early) symptom of Rubella.


People of all ages may develop achy joints and symptoms similar to arthritis that can last between 3–10 days.Rubella spreads in the same way that the common cold and influenza do — via tiny droplets when infected people sneeze, cough or leave secretions on surfaces.

, When women are infected with the rubella virus early during their pregnancy (first trimester), they have a 90% chance of passing the virus on to their developing fetus.When this happens, there is a 20% chance of miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects, such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, intellectual/developmental disability, and liver / spleen damage.Rubella infection during pregnancy is the most common cause of deafness in newborns.
If you want to get pregnant, make sure you've received your MMR vaccination well in advance.
If you're already pregnant, your doctor will likely screen you for immunity to rubella by taking a blood test.

, Rubella is a mild, self-limiting illness. Treatment is supportive and directed at relief of symptoms. You may be advised to take antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen, to control fever and fluid intake. This will help to promote and maintain adequate hydration.

The incubation period of rubella is 14 to 21 days. The period of communicability is from 1 week before the onset of the rash until about 7 days after the appearance of the rash.During communicability, a child with rubella should not attend school or daycare and should be isolated from pregnant women. If a child is severe enough to be hospitalized then precautions should be instituted until 5 days after the rash disappears.

, The rubella vaccine is usually given as a combined measles-mumps-rubella inoculation during early childhood — doctors recommend shots between 12-15 months old, then again between 4-6 years old (before entering school).Usually newborns are protected from rubella for up to 8 months due to the natural immunity passed on from their mothers.



Almost everyone who receives the MMR vaccine has immunity to rubella because the body builds antibodies against the rubella virus.
It's especially important that young girls receive the MMR vaccine to prevent rubella during future pregnancies due to the potential complications.
In some adults, the vaccine may ""wear off"" or not be effective. In such cases, it's possible to get a booster shot from your family doctor.
Rubella vaccines are also available by themselves (monovalent formulation), combined with only the measles vaccine (MR), or along with the measles, mumps and varicella vaccines (MMRV)., The United States, Canada and some countries in Europe have the highest rates and numbers of vaccinations in the world. Traveling to other countries, particularly underdeveloped ones in Africa and Asia, can put you at risk of getting infected by rubella or other viruses.One extreme solution is not to travel abroad to these countries, but a more reasonable approach is to take precautions while there. Washing your hands frequently and avoiding exchanging saliva or other body fluids with strangers is usually enough to prevent most infections.


Some developed countries in Europe and Asia, such as Japan, no longer give children MMR vaccines due to potential side effects. As such, you might be at higher risk of infection while in those countries.
Consider a booster shot of just the rubella vaccine if traveling to foreign countries — but sometimes (in rare cases) the side effect symptoms are worse than the actual infection.
Contact the World Health Organization (WHO) or look on their website to find out which countries vaccinate their population against the rubella virus.

, For any type of infection, true prevention depends on a strong immune system.Your immune system consists of specialized white blood cells that search and destroy disease-causing microorganisms such as the rubella virus. However, when it's weakened and malfunctioning, viruses and other pathogens can grow unchecked in body fluids and mucus, leading to various symptoms. Therefore, focus on ways to keep your immune system healthy in order to naturally prevent rubella and other infections.


Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating lots of fresh fruit and veggies, practicing good hygiene, keeping well hydrated and getting regular exercise are all ways to boost your immune system.Pay attention to your diet. Your immune system also benefits by cutting down on refined sugars (sodas, candy, ice cream, chocolate), cutting back on alcohol consumption and quitting smoking.
Supplements that can strengthen your immune response include: vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root."

Get moving.,
Change positions.,
Remove excessively tight clothing.,
Massage the foot.,
Warm your feet with a heated blanket or heating pad.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Know when to see your doctor.",How to Cure Numbness in Your Feet and Toes1," Often numbness in the feet or toes occurs when you have been sitting or standing in one place for a long time. The best way to get rid of this kind of numbness is to stimulate circulation in the foot by moving around. Try going for a short walk, or even just moving your foot around while you sit.


In addition to helping you get rid of occasional numbness, regular exercise can also help prevent numbness in the first place. Try to incorporate some physical activity into your daily schedule, even if it's just a short walk.
High impact exercises like jogging can cause numbness in the feet and toes for some people, so try lower impact exercises like swimming or biking.
Stretch well before workouts, wear appropriate exercise shoes, and exercise on level surfaces.;
, Numbness is often triggered by seating positions that pinch the nerves in your legs and/or feet. Avoid sitting on your feet or crossing your legs for long periods of time.If you have to sit for long periods of time, you might want to try elevating your feet periodically to increase blood flow.

, Overly tight pants, socks, or other garments worn on the lower part of your body might prevent blood from flowing to your feet, which can cause numbness. Remove or loosen these items to allow for better blood flow.

, Gently massaging the numb area of your foot can help increase circulation and make occasional numbness go away faster.

, Exposure to the cold can cause numbness and tingling. Warm your feet to get rid of numbness.

, High heels or shoes that pinch the toes can cause numbness. You may also experience numbness if you wear shoes that are too small for you, especially while exercising. Choose comfortable shoes that fit you well. Insoles may help make some of your shoes more comfortable.

, Occasional numbness in the feet or toes is usually no big deal, especially when there is an obvious cause, such as an uncomfortable seating position or tight clothing. If, however, you experience numbness frequently, or if it lasts for more than just a few minutes, you should see a doctor to make sure there are no underlying causes.Seek emergency treatment if your foot numbness accompanies symptoms such as weakness, paralysis, loss of bladder or bowel control, or slurring of speech.

Pregnancy often causes swelling of the feet and toes, which can cause numbness. If your doctor tells you that your numbness is due to pregnancy and not to any other condition, follow the recommendations for relief of occasional numbness."

Wear compression hose or sleeves.,
Use an inflatable pump.,
Talk to your doctor about taking medication.,
Get treated for underlying causes.",How to Cure or Alleviate Edema2," They put pressure on your limbs to prevent too much fluid from collecting. Compression garments may be found in most medical supply or drugstores, or you can talk with your doctor about getting one through your insurance.

, You may use inflatable garments around the swollen limb as another way to reduce swelling. These are easier to slip on than compression garments, and you have greater control over the pressure they exert. Talk to your doctor about whether using a pump is right for you.


Sequential gradient pump therapy is another option in which electric pumps connected to inflatable garments are used to repeatedly and sequentially compress and decompress the swollen limb to aid fluid circulation.

, If your edema doesn't go away on its own when you make lifestyle changes, your doctor may want to prescribe a diuretic to help flush the fluid from your body. Furosemide is the most commonly prescribed drug for treating edema., Edema may be caused by pregnancy or certain medications, but there are also many diseases and underlying medical conditions that can cause edema. If you experience edema without knowing the cause, it's very important to get immediate medical attention to determine what's going on. The following serious diseases and illnesses may cause edema:


Infection of or injury to blood vessels
Kidney, heart or liver disease
Brain injury
Allergies

Get a diagnosis.,
Manage your diabetes.,
Lose weight.,
Use products designed for diabetic foot care.,
Follow the tips for occasional numbness relief.,
Ask your doctor about alternative treatments.",How to Cure Numbness in Your Feet and Toes2," Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic numbness in the feet and toes. It causes numbness by both damaging the nerves and by causing poor circulation to your feet. Numbness is often one of the first symptoms of diabetes, so you should talk to your doctor and get tested right away if you have regular numbness that does not have another obvious cause.


Numbness can be extremely serious for people with diabetes because it may cause them not to feel pain in the feet caused by things like heat, punctures, or blisters.
Decreased circulation also means that the person's feet will heal much slower, so infection is a serious concern. For this reason it is very important that you take especially good care of your feet if you have diabetes.

, Keeping your blood glucose levels in check is the best way to prevent circulation issues and neuropathy, both of which can cause numbness, if you have diabetes. Develop a plan with your doctor that works for you.


Check your blood sugar regularly with a blood glucose meter and get your A1C levels tested a few times each year.
Although numbness in your feet and other symptoms of diabetes may make it difficult to exercise, do you best to stay active. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise each day, whether it is going to the gym or walking up and down the stairs at home.
Eat a healthy, balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fish, and low-fat dairy. Do your best to avoid foods that trigger blood sugar spikes, such as cookies and soda.
Take all of your prescribed medications, including insulin, regularly.
Smoking can worsen the symptoms of your diabetes, so ask your doctor for help quitting.

, Extra pounds and obesity can contribute to numbness in your feet and toes, so ask your doctor for tips on healthy weight loss to help alleviate some of your symptoms.


Losing weight may also help you lower your blood pressure, which may also help reduce numbness. If losing weight is not enough to get your blood pressure under control, consider talking to your doctor about medications., Compression hose and socks help stimulate circulation, which can decrease numbness.Special lotions that contain capsaicin may also provide you with relief from numbness., If you have diabetes, you may still benefit from some of the methods recommended for the relief of occasional numbness, such as moving your feet, elevating your feet, massaging your feet, and using warm compresses. While these techniques might offer you temporary relief from your symptoms, keep in mind that they will not cure the underlying disease, so you still need to be vigilant about managing your diabetes and taking care of your feet.

, Some studies have shown benefits to relaxation and biofeedback treatment, as well as anodyne therapy, in the treatment of foot numbness related to diabetes. These treatments may not be covered by your insurance, but they may be worth investigating if nothing else works to relieve your numbness.Your doctor may also prescribe medication to address your numbness, although it is likely to be an off-label use of the drug."

Get treatment for injuries.,
Discuss all medications with your doctor.,
Take vitamin supplements.,
Take medication for chronic conditions.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Treat the symptom.",How to Cure Numbness in Your Feet and Toes3," Injuries to the feet, toes, ankles, head, or spine can cause numbness to occur. An orthopedist, neurologist, or chiropractor may be able to treat your injury to relieve numbness., Chemotherapy drugs often cause numbness in the extremities, as do many other prescription drugs for a wide variety of conditions. If you begin experiencing numbness after you begin a new medication, discuss it with your doctor to determine if the benefits of the medication outweigh the side effects. There may be another medication available to treat your condition that will not have the same side effects.Never stop taking your medications without first discussing it with your doctor. For some medications, you will need to reduce your dosage slowly.

, A lack of vitamin B12 or other vitamins may be causing your numbness. Get a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, and begin taking the recommended supplements if you have any deficiencies., Persistent numbness in your feet and toes may be a symptom of any number of underlying conditions, including multiple sclerosis, arthritis, Lyme disease, and many more. Taking medications to treat the underlying condition may help reduce the numbness in your feet.If you have not been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, numbness in your feet and toes might be the first sign. Be sure to discuss all of your symptoms with your doctor so she will know what tests to run.
If you already have a diagnosis, but the numbness is a new symptom, be sure to bring it up at your next doctor's appointment to find out if there are additional medications you should take or other treatments you should pursue.

, Heavy alcohol consumption can cause a numbing sensations in the limbs, including feet and toes. Reducing your regular intake of alcohol can help to prevent numbness., If you are already taking all the necessary steps to treat the underlying cause of the numbness in your feet, but the numbness does not subside, try following the steps to relieve occasional numbness. While these methods will not cure your condition, doing things like elevating your feet, applying warm compresses, massaging the feet, and moving around may help alleviate the symptoms temporarily.

Do not depend on anti-diarrheal (AD) pills (e.g.,
Get toxins out: You may need to pass BMs (bowel movements) 6, 8,10 or more times per day to get the toxins out -- while being treated with special antibiotics that can eliminate C-Diff (more in the ""Treatment"" section).,
Do not take antibiotics unnecessarily.Due to the risk that antibiotics put you at for developing Clostridium difficile, it is important to take them only when they are needed.,
Expect, with mild to moderate infection with C-Diff, doctors may prescribe a special antibiotic such as metronidazole (Flagyl), taken by mouth (or by IV if in the hospital).,
Wash your hands regularly.One of the main ways in which Clostridium difficile infections are caught is by touching surfaces that are contaminated with spores from the bacteria.,
Avoid sharing the same home-/work-space and surfaces with someone who has diarrhea.,
Contact your doctor to prevent establishing C-Diff and C-dificille-colitis, even if the diarrhea is relatively mild when you are currently taking or have recently taken antibiotics and you develop diarrhea.",How to Prevent Clostridium Difficile Infections1,": ""Imodium AD""). Do not try that for more than 3 days, because that retains toxins from C-Diff. You might think the anti-diarrheal is helping but you may become drowsy, dizzy, nauseated and lose your appetite. Eventually the toxin can damage various systems (kidneys, liver) and your feet may swell and you may retain several liters of fluid in the body cavity (called ""third spacing"") because of toxin caused by this diarrhea not being excreted/being held in the body by your AD med.
,, Antibiotics will have zero impact in treating a viral infection, so your doctor will not advise that you take antibiotics if you have a viral infection such as the flu.


Caution: cases of Clostridium difficile almost always arise when you are already taking antibiotics for another illness. It is the taking of the antibiotics that predisposes your alimentary canal (gut) to ""bad bacteria"", making it susceptible to developing Clostridium difficile and C-dificille-colitis. ""Difficile"" is Latin for difficult (to cure).
When you take antibiotics (for a prior illness), they are often effective at treating that illness; however, the antibiotics also kill off many of the good bacteria in your intestine, which normally have a protective effect. With many of the good bacteria gone, your gut is less protected and you become susceptible to a Clostridium difficile infection.
If you do have a serious bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, however, it is important that you follow through with treatment.
Untreated bacterial infection can lead to blood poisoning (sepsis), and inflammation clogging small blood vessels, even gangrene (deadtissue). Do not stop antibiotic treatment in the hopes of preventing Clostridium difficile, because minor bacterial infections can become major and be life-threatening.

, Although metronidazole is not designated by the FDA for C. difficile infection, it has been shown in use to be effective in mild to moderate infection. Side effects of metronidazole include nausea and a bitter taste in your mouth.For more severe and recurrent cases, vancomycin (Vancocin), also taken by mouth, may be prescribed. Another oral antibiotic, fidaxomicin (Dificid), has been approved to treat C. difficile. In one study, the recurrence rate of C. difficile in people who took fidaxomicin was lower than among those who took vancomycin. However, fidaxomicin costs much more than metronidazole (Flagyl) and vancomycin. Common side effects of vancomycin and fidaxomicin (Dificid) include abdominal pain and nausea. Your doctor will help to guide you as to when continuing antibiotics are beneficial for you to take, and when they are not/and need to stop., One of the highest risk areas are healthcare facilities, due to the larger number of cases of Clostridium difficile that occur in places such as hospitals, as well as the length of time that spores can survive on surfaces.


Especially if you are in a hospital or other healthcare setting, be sure to wash your hands regularly. Wash with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Alcohol-based hand rubs/fluids are ineffective.Bleach wipes containing 0.55% sodium hypochlorite have been shown to kill the spores and prevent transmission between patients.Installing lidded toilets and closing the lid prior to flushing also reduces the risk of contamination., If a family member, a friend, or another person in a healthcare facility contracts diarrhea, it is key to avoid sharing the same space as them until the cause of their diarrhea is confirmed. Their diarrhea could be due to Clostridium difficile, which is highly contagious, or to other highly contagious gastrointestinal illnesses, none of which you want to catch.


Keeping in your own separate space and avoiding shared objects can help you to prevent a Clostridium difficile infection or another unwanted illness.

, See your doctor any time you have severe diarrhea, with fever, painful abdominal cramps, and possibly with mucus, blood or pus in your stool.

Assess your symptoms.,
Seek medical help if you have the symptoms of a serious infection.,
Decide whether a superficial toe infection can be treated at home.",How to Cure an Infected Toe1," Sometimes it can be hard to tell what kind of infection you have in your toe and if it is serious or not. It could be a simple ingrown toenail or a more serious infection that could spread into the rest of your body. In order to tell the difference you should assess your symptoms.


The signs and symptoms of a light infection include: pain and/or tenderness, swelling, redness, and increased warmth in the area.The signs and symptoms of a more serious infection include: the formation of pus, red streaks extending from the initial wound, fever.;
, Once again, these symptoms include pus, red streaks radiating from the wound, or a fever. If you experience any of these, call your physician for advice right away.A serious infection can move from your toe into the rest of your body. A really bad infection can even put your system into shock and threaten your life. Because of the seriousness of this, it is important to get a bad infection looked at by a health professional as soon as possible.

, If you don't have any of the serious symptoms, but you are in a bit of discomfort, you may be able to treat the infection at home. Like other types of minor injuries, it might be possible to treat the infection by cleaning the area, applying an antibiotic, and keeping the area bandaged for a few days If this seems like the case, then go ahead with treating the issue this way.


If you have cleaned the area thoroughly, applied a good antibiotic, and kept the area bandaged and clean, and it is still hurting or getting more painful or inflamed, then it is time to get it looked at by a medical professional.
If the infection is mild and doesn't seem like a serious risk to your health, you can still make an appointment to get it looked at. Use your own judgement and remember that it's always better to be safe than sorry.

Be aware of when you or others in your care are at most risk of contracting listeriosis.,
Know how to prevent the disease.,
Wash your hands both before and after handling food.,
Take care with eating practices.,
Observe the food handling practices used when eating out.",How to Prevent Listeriosis," While anyone can be infected with the illness if they come into contact with the bacterium, there are those who are at an increased risk. This includes:



Pregnant women (about 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to get listeriosis).

Newborns.
People over the age of 65 years.
People who have weakened immune systems, such as those who are undergoing chemotherapy or taking glucocorticosteroid medications.
Persons with AIDS (almost 300 times more likely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems).;
, The steps taken to prevent listeriosis are very much like those used to help prevent other food caused illnesses. Maintain safe food practices at all times in the kitchen, at a barbecue, on a picnic, or wherever food handling and consumption is occurring. Safe handling practices include:


Keep raw meats separated from vegetables, fruit, foods that have been cooked, and ready-to-eat foods.
Thoroughly cook raw foods from animals, such as beef, pork, and poultry.
Avoid getting the fluid from hot dog packages on other foods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces.

, Always wash your hands after touching animals and after being outside, prior to handling or consuming food.



Wash hands, knives, cutting boards, and counter tops after handling uncooked foods.
Wash your hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats.
Wash raw vegetables thoroughly before consumption, especially those that have been grown using manure as a fertilizer.

, The following suggestions will help to prevent listeriosis:


Avoid unpasteurized milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk.
Use perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as possible.
Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, or deli-meats, unless they have been reheated and are steaming hot.
Do not eat soft cheeses unless they have labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk.
Do not eat refrigerated pâtés or meat spreads. Canned or shelf-stable pâtés and meat spreads may be eaten.
Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked dish (such as a casserole). Canned or shelved smoked seafood is safe.

, If you see signs of poor handling or dirty maintenance of a food place, choose not to eat there.

"
"
Drink plenty of fluids if you have diarrhea.,
Choose soft, easy-to-digest foods to ease possible C-Diff.",How to Prevent Clostridium Difficile Infections2," Water is best, but fluids with added sodium and potassium (electrolytes) also may be beneficial. Avoid beverages that are high in sugar or contain alcohol -- or caffeine (such as coffee, tea and colas) -- which can aggravate your digestive symptoms., These include applesauce, banana, banana powder, yogurt, plain boiled-mashed potatoes and rice. Avoid high-fiber foods when having diarrhea or irritated colon, such as beans, nuts and vegetables. If you feel your symptoms are improving, slowly add high-fiber foods back to your diet.

Eat several smaller meals, rather than a few large meals. Space the smaller meals throughout the day.
Avoid irritating foods. Stay away from spicy, fatty or fried foods, and any other foods that make your symptoms worse.

Ensure that your healthcare facility has an antibiotic stewardship program.One of the key steps in preventing Clostridium difficile infections at the systemic level (at the level of the healthcare system, in places such as hospitals) is to have an ""antibiotic stewardship program"" in place.,
Consider giving high levels of beneficial bacteria/germs.,
Wash your hands, use vinyl gloves for simple work/visit.,
Practice ""contact precautions"" anytime someone has diarrhea.Because diarrhea is a sign of a possible Clostridium difficile infection, it is important for healthcare staff to practice ""contact precautions"" anytime a patient has a case of diarrhea.,
Clean and disinfect with bleach based sprays or wipes.,
Ask the lab to inform you of positive results as soon as possible.Any patient in a hospital or healthcare facility who presents with diarrhea will have a sample sent to the lab to test for the presence of Clostridium difficile.",How to Prevent Clostridium Difficile Infections3," This is a program that ensures that doctors and other healthcare professionals stay fully up-to-date on when antibiotics are needed and advised, and when they are not. It helps to prevent the unnecessary use of antibiotics, and to guide the best possible decision-making on behalf of doctors in this area.

, Treatment with Saccharomyces boulardii in those who are not immunocompromised with C difficile also may be useful.Those with lowered resistance/low in white blood cells can be attacked in the gut by the usually good bacteria, so caution is in order to be able to fight off good bacteria becoming infectious, as well as the bad bacteria. When recovering from C-Diff, the patient may be healthy enough to take tens of billions of units of multiple strains of good-bacteria/-germs (called probiotics) -- if the immune system is strong so probiotics can help fight off bad C-Diff germs and prevent overgrowth by the C-Diff. Good bacteria can get where it does not belong when immunity is low.
Good bacteria may be killed by almost any antibiotic(s). But only a few can kill C-Diff because it has a spore form/similar to a pupa that is not killed easily, if at all, by most antibiotics.
Occasionally, while healthy, take good-germs (probiotics) as a preventive of initial overgrowth by C-Diff.
After antibiotic treatments and with the immune system in tact, the patient might need large amounts of probiotics as a precaution against recurrence(s). The good bacteria is crucial for not allowing a new over powering infection. Active culture yogurt may help some but are not sufficient.

There are also products sold as prebiotics (pre/before vs pro/for). These are forms of saccharides/like indigestible sugars that are said to be food to strengthen the good-bacteria/probiotics in the intestines.

, Add a plastic, cover-all gown, if you must have contact with the patient, the bed, bed rails, door handles and furniture used by or possibly contacted by the patient.It is key that doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals wash their hands regularly. Ideally, healthcare providers should put on sterile gloves or wash their hands every time they enter and exit a patient's room. The plastic gown must be put on in the hall and then be taken off inside the room/at the door of the infected patient's space and disposed of in large waste can in that room.


Washing, or putting on fresh gloves when you enter, ensures that you do not bring any Clostridium difficile spores into the uninfected patient's space.
Washing or removing gloves when you exit ensures that no germs (including possible Clostridium difficile) are transported out of the patient's space in a way that may infect others.

, This includes wearing a gown, a mask, and gloves every time they enter the space, and throwing these out immediately after use so as not to contaminate anywhere outside the space.


If you are around someone with undiagnosed diarrhea (i.e. the cause is not known, so it may be Clostridium difficile), it is key to avoid touching shared surfaces or shared objects if you do not want to catch (or pass on) the infection.

, Do not only use cleaners claiming to kill 99.9% of germs. C-Diff is in the 0.1% not all killed by that kind of cleaner. Disinfect any shared surfaces, door knobs, doors and door frames, equipment, or other objects the patient -- or any visitors' gloves may contact.Use a diluted bleach solution, wipes or spray to clean the environment that may be contaminated with Clostridium difficile spores. This is the most effective mode of cleaning, and it is what is required in hospital settings (and at home).


Always use gloves when cleaning and sterilizing equipment, the surrounding environment, and other shared objects.
Continue to practice diligent hygiene and cleaning practices until a Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out with diagnostic tests.

, If the test comes back positive, the lab is to inform the staff immediately so that appropriate precautions can be maintained around the affected person.

"
"
Recognize potential signs and symptoms of a Clostridium difficile infection.It is important to be able to recognize potential signs and symptoms of a Clostridium difficile infection, both so that the affected person can receive treatment, and also so that others can practice preventative measures to avoid becoming infected themselves.,
Stop antibiotics that you are taking if you develop diarrhea.Because Clostridium difficile is an infection that most often arises when too many your good bacteria are killed by an antibiotic therapy.,
Beware of the risk of recurrence.Even when Clostridium difficile infections are successfully treated, they recur shortly down the road in approximately 20% of patients.",How to Prevent Clostridium Difficile Infections4," Signs and symptoms of severe infection include:Watery diarrhea (up to 10 to 15 times a day, see your doctor after at least three episodes per day) lasting for two or more days.
Fever is possible -- such as exceeding 100.4 F (approx 41 C)
Abdominal cramping and pain
Nausea
Rapid heart rate
Blood or pus (looks like mucus) in the stool
Dehydration (due to diarrhea and lack of thirst)
Decreased appetite
Weight loss
Swollen abdomen (fluid retention in abdominal cavity)
Swollen feet (and male gonads eventually)
Kidney failure (with low urine output or inability to release urine) is possible due to the toxins of C-Diff
An increase in white blood cell count

, If you develop signs and symptoms and test positive for Clostridium difficile it is key to stop your present antibiotics immediately. This will prevent worsening of the infection. Your doctor will have antibiotics to treat Clostridium difficile, which will most likely be different than the antibiotics you were on in the first place.


The general first-line antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile infections is an antibiotic called metronidazole (Flagyl).
Other antibiotic therapies that can be tried include Vancomycin or Fidaxomicin.

, Therefore, after receiving treatment, it is important to be on the lookout for any further diarrhea or other symptoms, and to seek medical help immediately if you suspect that you may have a recurrence.


Recurrences will again be treated with antibiotics that are specific to a Clostridium difficile infection.
Relapse may present within days or weeks, especially if your probiotics are not restored. The clinical presentation may be similar to or more severe than the initial presentation.
For people with multiple recurrences, there is a new therapy called a ""fecal transplant"" (a stool transplant) that is relatively new, but has shown success at effectively treating Clostridium difficile.

Recognize the signs of a jungle rot infection.,
Treat your ulcer(s) with procaine benzylpenicillin.See your doctor to receive this treatment.,
Dress the lesions properly.The application of daily non-adherent dressing is also warranted in order to keep the lesions clean and to minimize the spread of infection.,
Use broad-spectrum antibiotics.,
Consider debridement.In more aggressive cases where the ulcers are severe, debridement under local anesthesia is advised.,
Consider skin grafting.This can also be done when the ulcers are extensive.,
Use vinegar to clean and wash the lesions.Vinegar has amazing antibacterial as well as anti-infective properties that can help to lessen the spread of infection.,
Use turmeric.This is not just your usual kind of spice that can be added to add life to an otherwise mundane dish.,
Consider vitamin E.You can also apply vitamin E to soothe extreme pain and itchiness.,
Try witch hazel.Another home remedy which is thought to have a soothing effect is witch hazel.,
See your doctor if your lesions get worse.,
Wear the appropriate shoes and socks.This is especially important if you are living in places where jungle rot is widespread.,
Keep your feet clean and dry.,
Clean your surrounding area.",How to Cure Jungle Rot,"""Jungle rot"" is a term used to describe one or more tropical ulcers, which are normally caused by mixed bacterial infections (i.e. having more than one bacterial specimen involved). They are most commonly developed in tropical locations. They are painful and they may result in permanent damage to the surrounding tissues. In the most severe cases, if left untreated, the surrounding tissue may progressively die off, leading to a need for skin grafts and/or limb amputation. Therefore, dealing with the condition sooner rather than later is key. Common signs and symptoms include:


One or more raised lesions, usually on the feet and/or the lower legs.
A somewhat undermined border to the lesion.
A discoloured base is common, such as being yellow or black.
There may be signs of dead tissue.
They are more prevalent in children, teenagers, and women.;
, It is administered via an intramuscular injection. It is a combination of the antibiotic penicillin (which fights against many different bacteria) and an anesthetic (pain-killing) agent called procaine. It is injected around the area of your wound(s), and is then absorbed into the bloodstream and circulated throughout your body.A common treatment for jungle rot is 600,000 IU daily of procaine benzylpenicillin for two to four weeks. However, your physician may provide a different dose depending on the formulation, severity of the disease, and the physician's opinion of the lesion.
For children under the age of 12, the dose should be adjusted to 25,000-50,000 IU/kg (the doctor will calculate the specific dose based on the child's body weight).

, The dressing should not be tight on the ulcer to allow the area to heal. Here are the basics:


Clean the area with water. It is important that the water you use be of the same sanitation as drinking water. Therefore, if you are concerned at all about water quality, boil it first and let it cool prior to using it to clean your ulcer(s). You do not want to introduce any new microorganisms into your wound.After cleaning with water, gently pat your wound dry.
Apply liberal amounts of silver sulfadiazine over the affected area then cover it with the dressing. Depending on the severity of your condition, the dressing should be applied several times a day.Once the dressing starts to become wet, a dressing change must be done right away in order to control the spread of infection and to promote healing.
Continue this process until the lesions have disappeared.

, Jungle rot is often treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like tetracycline, ampicillin and mebendazole.In the later stages of jungle rot, if penicillin alone has not been sufficient to cure it, you may need to branch out to other antibiotics. Speak to your doctor to determine the best antibiotic regimen for you.


Be sure to finish the whole course of antibiotics that is prescribed to you.
Failure to comply with your antibiotic prescription may lead to incomplete resolution of your jungle rot, and it may return down the road.
Therefore, be sure to finish all of your pills, as instructed by your doctor.

, Debridement is the surgical, chemical or mechanical removal of an unhealthy tissue to give way to new tissue growth which results in wound healing. This is also a way to save an otherwise healthy limb from needing amputation.

, The procedure is done under general anesthesia, meaning that you will be unconscious and will not feel any pain while the surgery is being performed. The procedure involves removing a patch of the skin from one part of the body and attaching it or transplanting it to another area.


Amputation can also be done, where a part of the leg is removed due to extensive dead tissue.
Note that this is only done in the most extreme of cases, when the jungle rot infection can't otherwise be controlled.

, Wash the area with a solution of warm water and a cup of vinegar three to five times a day until you observe that the lesions and ulcers are drying and healing. It is also important to remember to keep the affected area dry at all costs.

, It can be consumed as part of the treatment for jungle rot or directly applied to affected areas. All you have to do is to apply turmeric paste three times a day or when you deem it necessary until the sores become dry. Turmeric has promising results and it can hasten the healing process.


You can also create a paste using turmeric powder.
Add a cup of powder with warm water and mix the solution; keep adding powder until the solution thickens.
Let it cool for a couple of minutes and then afterwards you can directly apply it to your lesions.
Turmeric works because, like vinegar, it also has anti-infective and antibacterial properties.

, Apply vitamin E directly to the affected part 3 times a day until the lesions start to dry up and heal. Vitamin E has soothing effects that can help to ease the itchiness and crusting of lesions.


Eat plenty of foods that are rich in vitamin E - they help to maintain the good health of the skin.
These foods include spinach, nuts, pumpkins, broccoli, avocado and rainbow trout fish.

, Apply liberal amounts over the affected area three to five times a day.

, Remember that if symptoms persist even after using these home remedies then it is best to drop by your doctor’s office to consider medical treatment. Because jungle rot can lead to tissue death if left untreated, if you notice it worsening it is key to be evaluated by a medical professional for definitive treatment sooner rather than later.

, Wear knee high boots if possible, especially if you are working in rivers or streams.

, Wash your feet after being exposed to unsanitary areas and keep them dry at all costs. A dry environment will keep the bacteria from spreading. Medicated powders can be used to keep the feet dry. This includes Tinactin that can be applied twice a day after thorough cleaning and drying the feet. But it's not only your feet - your limbs and the ground you touch should be as dry as possible, too.


Wear breathable shoes to allow free air circulation.
Feel free to go barefoot as well, as long as you're in sanitary conditions and not putting anyone else at risk.

, Since jungle rot is contagious, it's important to maintain a hygienic environment. Wash your clothes thoroughly and any floors and areas that have been in contact with the affected skin.

Follow your doctor's suggestions for treatment of a minor infection.,
Get medical treatment for a serious infection.,
Use medicine to treat a superficial infection.",How to Cure an Infected Toe2," This treatment will vary, depending on what is causing the infection. He or she may prescribe oral or topical antibiotics, however, many times a doctor will simply suggest soaking the toe in a solution of ½ warm water and ½ liquid antibacterial soap for about 15 minutes three to four times every day and keeping the area clean.Soaking helps with the infection and softens the skin to allow the infection to “come to a head.""
In the case of toenail fungal infections, your doctor may prescribe an oral anti-fungal medication or an anti-fungal prescription nail polish., If the infection is deep and serious, a physician may suggest treating it with a small surgical procedure.This means a quick surgical drainage of an infection, usually used in the case of an abscess.


The physician may first numb the toe with lidocaine and then open the infection with a scalpel and allow the pus to drain. Then, depending on how deep the infection is, a wicking material may be placed in the wound to allow for more drainage.
The wound is then packed with gauze for 24 to 48 hours. The packing can be removed after this time and the wound is then examined and re-bandaged.Oral antibiotics may be given as well.

, Surface (superficial) infections of the toe can be treated in a number of ways. These include:


Soaking: Just as with a more serious infection, soaking toe in a solution of ½ warm water and ½ a liquid antibacterial soap is usually recommended. You should soak for about 15 minutes once a day.
OTC (over-the-counter) antibiotic creams and ointments for bacterial infections: These include Polysporin, Neosporin, Bacitracin or a Triple Antibiotic ointment.
OTC (over-the-counter) anti-fungal creams for fungal infections: These include Lotrimin, Derman, Canestan, or another anti-fungal medicine.

Use tea tree oil on an infection.,
Soak the toe in apple cider vinegar.,
Apply a garlic paste on the infection.,
Soak the toe in Epsom salts daily.,
Dilute Listerine mouthwash in warm water and soak the toe.,
See your doctor if home remedies do not help.",How to Cure an Infected Toe3," Apply the tea tree oil directly onto either a bacterial or a fungal infection. The tea tree is naturally anti-bacterial and can help to kill an infection.For example, tea tree oil has been shown to reduce athlete's foot infections in clinical studies., You should do this for 15 minutes every day. The apple cider vinegar can be warm or cold. Use whatever temperature is most comfortable for you.Apple cider vinegar has documented antimicrobial properties, likely at least in part due to its acidic nature. Vinegar in general has been used for hundreds of years for its anti-infection properties., Crush two to three cloves of peeled garlic and mix with either olive oil, castor oil, or manuka honey, which also has anti-microbial properties.Put onto the infection and cover with a bandage.Change the garlic daily.
Garlic has natural antibiotic properties that make it helpful for fighting skin infections, such as staph., Add about ½ cup of Epsom salts to three cups of warm water. Let your toe soak in the solution for 15 minutes, or until the water gets too cold.


The high salt content can kill bacteria and fungal infections.

, Take equal parts Listerine and warm water and soak the toe daily. Listerine can help a simple infection because it contains menthol, thymol, and eucalyptol, which are all derived from various natural antibiotic sources.If you have a toenail fungus infection, a soak of 50/50 Listerine and white vinegar can help eliminate the infection., If your infection does not improve within a few days of using home remedies or if it seems to be getting worse, then you will need to see a doctor for treatment. Do not continue using these treatments if they are not working."

Look out for signs that you're soaking too much.",How to Control Foot Odor with Baking Soda1," Find a bucket or tub large enough to put your feet in, and fill it with warm water. Add 1/4 cup of baking soda at a time until the bath remains cloudy, stirring after each addition.


Baking soda is known to exhibit anti-microbial activity, preventing the formation of smelly compounds associated with foot odor.Add some fresh squeezed lemon juice for a nice citrus smell.;
, Soaking them for at least 15 minutes daily will help to reduce the odor that your feet produce. For added benefit, scrub them with a washcloth towards the end of your 15 minute soak.


The baking soda helps kill bacteria on your feet while also softening your feet to make dead skin more easily removable., Avoid putting on socks and/or shoes for 10-15 minutes after to ensure your feet are fully dry. Reducing the amount of moisture in your socks and shoes will help keep away the bad odors., If you're soaking for too long each sitting, or soaking too often, you may notice extremely wrinkled or sensitive feet. Decrease the length of your soaks or the frequency if you notice anything strange.

Wait and watch.,
Monitor vitamin D levels in your child's diet.,
Consider using medical braces.,
Understand the complications of failure to treat bow-legs.",How to Cure Bow Legs1," If your child is under three years old, bow-legs will likely fix themselves. Monitor your child as they grow and develop to make sure the bow in their legs is diminishing. If you notice any irregularity in their gait as they begin walking, talk with your pediatrician.Note that ""watching and waiting"" is the mainstay of treatment for young children with bow-legs.
The key is to have regular check-ups with your child's doctor, to ensure that an intervention (such as casting the legs or, in severe cases, surgery) can be obtained promptly if they do not resolve on their own.;
, Rickets disease, which is caused by a lack of vitamin D in a diet, is one thing that can cause bow-legs to develop. Increasing levels of vitamin D if they are low can help prevent Rickets from occurring and may help to correct bow-legs if already present.Note that a vitamin D deficiency is not the cause of bow-legs unless your child has proven low levels of vitamin D upon testing.
In other words, it may be the cause of bow-legs, but the two do not necessarily go hand-in-hand.
It is advisable for your child to have their vitamin D levels tested to ensure that they are in the normal range, and to receive vitamin D supplements if they are not.

, Special leg braces, shoes, or casts may be used to treat bow-legs in young children, if they do not appear to be resolving spontaneously as the child grows. These are used if the condition is severe or the child has an additional disease in conjunction with bow-legs. The braces are worn by the child until the bones have been straightened.Understand that this style of treatment is only used in severe cases.
If needed, your doctor may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon for further treatment, such as surgery, for cases that cannot be corrected by the use of braces or casts alone., If you allow your child's bow-legs to persist through to adolescence, the picture can get much more complicated. The strain on your child's joints will be high due to the altered shape of their legs and knee joints. This can lead to pain in the ankles, hips, and/or knees. It can make it challenging to do prolonged physical activity, and it increases your child's chances of developing arthritis in later years due to wear and tear on his or her joints."

Attack the shoes as a source of smell.,
Put baking soda in your shoes every night after wearing them.,
Pour out the baking soda before putting your shoes on.,
Apply baking soda to particularly smelly shoes for a few days.",How to Control Foot Odor with Baking Soda2," Your shoes may be the root of the problem if you have sweaty feet. Shoes that are always damp and warm from being worn make an excellent environment for bacteria to grow.Some of the bacteria and the associated scent can then easily transfer to your feet every time you wear your shoes.

, Pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the heel of each shoe and shake some of the powder down to the toes. The baking soda will absorb moisture in the shoes, which will reduce the chances of growing odorous bacteria. Additionally, baking soda absorbs the already existent odors, reducing the scent left in your shoes when you put them on the next day., Do not wash the shoes with water to remove the baking soda. Remember, moisture will only increase the chances of growing bacteria and, as a result, making your feet and shoes stink.If you are having trouble removing all of the baking soda, try using a hand towel or knocking the shoes off on a hard surface.

, If you've got an older pair of shoes, or one that has built up a particularly pungent odor from being worn when working out, you may need to let the baking soda work for longer. Leave baking soda in these shoes for days at a time, replacing the powder every other day if possible.

Use a foot deodorant.,
Apply a traditional deodorant or antiperspirant.,
Use an astringent.,
Remove the dead skin from your feet.",How to Control Foot Odor with Baking Soda3," Bacteria are known to produce common compounds associated with foot odor.Scrub your feet in the shower and dry them afterwards. You can also apply an antibacterial foot spray or foot powder to reduce scent producing bacteria.


Don't forget the areas in between your toes! These areas are more likely to hold moisture and heat and, as a result, have a higher chance of containing bacteria.
Applying hand sanitizers to your feet is another option to help kill bacteria.

, A small amount (1 oz) of bleach per gallon of water is thought to help kill bacteria on your feet after a 5 to 10 minute soak. Some other common home remedies include:


Vinegar water. For every quart of water add 1/2 cup vinegar. Soak for 15 minutes and rinse with water afterwards.
Salt water. Add half a cup of salt for every quart of water, and soak your feet for 15 minutes. Don't rinse with water and just dry your feet after the soak.
Aluminum acetate soak. Combine 1 packet Domeboro powder or 2 tablespoons of Burow's solution with a pint of water and soak your feet for 10 to 20 minutes. Rinse with water afterwards.

, Cotton and wool socks drastically reduce the moisture absorbed by your shoes. Additionally, they are significantly easier than shoes to clean and change after each use. Washing socks between each wear is important, as it keeps smelly bacteria from growing.


When you wash your socks, turn them inside out to ensure that all of the dead skin gets washed out.
If you must re-wear a pair of socks prior to washing, put some baking soda in them overnight to reduce moisture and bacteria that cause bad odors.

, The extra time sitting on the shelf will allow your shoes to dry out and stop bacteria from growing. You can aid this process by removing the insoles, or drying your shoes with a specialized shoe dryer.

, Athletic style shoes that are meant to handle water and moisture are usually fine to wash in the washing machine. If you get your shoes particularly sweaty or wet from athletic activity or outdoor adventures, washing your shoes is definitely a good option.


Don't wash nice shoes, like dress shoes or loafers, as they are likely to degrade and fall apart.

, Cooler feet means less sweat, which translates to less smell. Not only will the increased air flow reduce moisture around your feet, but it will also lower the temperature, leading to less favorable breeding grounds for bacteria.

, Many deodorants are available for both your feet and shoes. Some common examples work by trapping odor-causing molecules and absorbing moisture from the feet, socks, and shoes.


Baby powder is also commonly used as a foot and shoe deodorant and moisture remover.
Don't let your feet dry and crack. While getting rid of foot odor is important, you may need to occasionally apply moisturizing lotion to prevent your skin from cracking.

, If you use underarm antiperspirant or deodorant, grab a spare stick and apply to your feet before you go to sleep. Similar to applying on your underarms, this should reduce the moisture produced by your feet and help cover up some of the odor.


Make sure your feet are dry before applying deodorant or antiperspirant.

, Astringents are compounds which absorb moisture from the cells. Some good examples are mineral salts like potassium alum, witch hazel, or talcum powder. These compounds can be slightly irritating, but are well-known household remedies for body odor and sweat.

, There are plenty of tools, like pumice stones and foot files, that can be used to regularly remove dead skin. Though there is not a scientific consensus, it is generally believed that some common odor-causing bacteria feed on dead skin.

Take note if you hear a ‘popping’ noise when the injury happens.,
Monitor any pain you feel.,
Keep track of any swelling that occurs.,
Check to see if your knee is warmer than normal and has a red color.,
See if you can move your knee.,
Know the common causes of ACL injuries.,
Be aware of the risk factors that can lead to ACL injuries.",How to Confirm a Partial ACL Tear1," Most people state that they hear a popping noise when the ACL is injured. If you heard a ‘popping’ or ‘snapping’ noise when you experienced your injury, it is likely that your ACL has been at least partially torn. You should go to the doctor to get this diagnosis confirmed.


Though you will most likely be in pain, try to remember the exact sound your knee made. Describing the noise your knee made can actually help your doctor to diagnose your injury.;
, Injuring your knee, regardless of whether it is a partial tear or just a minor sprain, can really hurt. In particular, you will most likely feel a radiating or gnawing pain when trying to do any physical activity.


When you suffer a partial tear of you ACL, the pain receptors in your knee get activated. This can lead to a moderate to severe pain.

, Swelling is your body’s way of repairing internal structures whenever it has suffered an injury. If you notice that your knee has become swollen after your accident, you have most likely suffered at least a partial tear.You should also take note if your knee becomes swollen after any time you do a physical activity. While you may not have noticed the swelling right after your accident, swelling after physical activity is a definite sign that you knee has been injured and could be partially torn.

, Along with the swelling, your knee will become warm to the touch and reddish in color. Your body will increase the temperature at the spot where the injury occurred to prevent infection since bacteria can’t generally thrive in a warm environment., If you have suffered a partially torn ACL, you will most likely have trouble moving your knee from side to side and back and forth. This is because the ligament has been injured, so you will probably have a hard time walking.Even if you can walk, your knee will most likely feel weak.

, An ACL injury almost always occurs when motion is involved. You may have suddenly changed direction in a basketball game, or you may have landed awkwardly while going off a jump on the ski slopes. If you think you may have partially torn your ACL, it is important to know the instances in which ACLs are generally injured. These instances include:


Suddenly changing direction.
Suddenly stopping while you were in motion.
Having a heavy force or pressure put on your knee, such as when colliding with someone in football.
Jumping and landing incorrectly or awkwardly.
Suddenly slowing down when running.

, While anyone can get an ACL injury, some factors or activities can predispose you to getting injured.You are much more likely to get an ACL injury when:


You engage in athletic sports that involve the active use of your legs. Sports that involve physical contact can also increase your chances of ACL injury.
You experience muscular fatigue. Muscular fatigue can also make a person prone to ACL injury. Since the muscle works together with the bones, ligaments and tendons, exerting your muscles and making them tired can lead to a higher risk of injury. For example, a tired soccer player is more susceptible to ACL injury than an energetic player who has just started playing.
You have a medical condition that causes you to have weak muscles or bones. For example, having weak and brittle bones, having ineffective development of your cartilage, or being obese can all increase your chances of an ACL tear.

Talk to your doctor about surgery.,
Manage your cast after surgery.,
Attend physiotherapy sessions.",How to Cure Bow Legs2," In adults and adolescents with severe cases of bow-legs, surgery is often the only option. The surgery will shift the way your bones rest on your knee, correcting the bow-leg and reducing strain on the cartilage. Your doctor will be able to tell you if surgery is right for you.This surgery can reduce pain and strain on the knee.
Full recovery time may be up to one year.

, After you receive surgery to correct bow-legs, you will likely need to wear a cast as you recover. Recovery time can vary from person to person., Your doctor will likely have you visit with a physical therapist after your surgery. A physical therapist will work with you to help you maintain and recover both strength and range of motion in your leg.A physical therapist can help you recover as fully as you can after surgery.
Although surgery can correct bow-legs, the surgery itself is taxing and proper recovery is a must.

Don't panic if your young child has bowlegs.,
Look for some of the common causes of bow-legs.,
Visit with your doctor.",How to Cure Bow Legs3," When children are born, their knees and legs are not yet fully formed. As they grow, the cartilage around their knee hardens and turns into bone, allowing them the support they need to walk. However, if a child older than three or an adult still has bow-legs, they may need treatment.Bow-legs should disappear by age three.
Bow legs in children over three or in adults is considered unusual.
Diagnosis and treatment for older children and adults is necessary to correct bow-legs.
Treating bow-legs sooner rather than later is easier and can have greater results.
Only severe cases of bow-legs in adults or older children need treatment.

, There are a few main causes that can be responsible for the development of bow-legs in an individual. These range from injury to disease and treatments will vary depending on the cause. Review the following list to learn some of the more common causes of bow-legs:Any injury, fracture, or trauma that has not healed correctly.
Any abnormal bone development can cause bow-legs to occur.
Lead poisoning can be responsible for bow-legs.
Some cases of bow-legs are caused by Rickets disease, which can be caused by a lack of vitamin D.
Blount's disease can be responsible for developing bow-legs.

, Your doctor will be able to properly diagnose bow-legs and discover what may have caused them. By visiting your doctor you can also learn about the best treatments and what you can expect after receiving them.Your doctor will likely order an x-ray to see how much the bones are bowed.
The degree of the bow will also be measured. In a young person, this may be measured over time to track if the bow is worsening.
Blood tests may be used to check for Rickets disease.

Watch for lateral hip pain.,
Take note of hip pain that's worse after activity.,
Look for hip swelling.",How to Cope With Trochanteric Bursitis," One of the main causes of bursitis of the hip, or any other large joint, is repetitive motions that strain tendons and inflame the underlying bursa sacs.This can happen with too much jogging, cycling, stair climbing, kicking or standing, especially on hard surfaces. As such, don't overdo it at work or while exercising.


Run on softer surfaces (such as grass or a treadmill) if you're a jogger. Reduce your mileage if you start to feel hip pain.
You may need to adjust your bike seat and/or get better suspension if cycling triggers hip pain.
If you stand for long periods of time as a cashier or something similar, place a rubberized or cushioned mat on the floor of your work area to act as a shock absorber.;
, Another primary cause of hip bursitis is poor posture.If you always lean to one side while standing, habitually cross your legs while sitting, have scoliosis (curvature) in your spine, suffer from hip or knee arthritis, have flat feet, and/or have a short leg, then you are much more likely to develop trochanteric bursitis.


Remember to stand and sit up straight, as leaning puts more pressure on the hip joints you lean towards.
When one leg is significantly shorter than the other (due to a leg injury, arthritis or fallen arch) it negatively affects the way you walk, which leads to hip joint irritation.Shoe orthotics (inserts) can support the arches of your feet and correct for a short leg, which reduces the risk of hip bursitis.

, Exercising and stretching the muscles around your hip joints can help reduce pressure on the joints and associated bursa sacs. Gentle forms of yoga may improve trochanteric bursitis by increasing flexibility and reducing muscle tension surrounding the hip joints.Ask at your local gym, community center, church or chiropractor's office about yoga classes. Alternatively, search online for qualified yoga teachers and sign up for beginner classes.


Before joining a yoga class, ask your doctor if the movements are appropriate for your case of bursitis. You may have to limit certain postures. The yoga instructor may also be familiar with what to focus on and what to avoid.
Avoid ""hot yoga"" classes because they may be too vigorous and the higher temperatures may inflame your bursitis.
Other mild exercises, such as Pilates and Tai Chi, might also improve muscle / ligament strength around your hips and reduce tension and inflammation triggered by repetitive movements., Since bursitis is an inflammatory condition, applying ice (or something cold) over the affected area helps to reduce the swelling and associated pain.Feel around the outside part of your hip / top of your buttocks to find the most tender area. Apply a bag of crushed ice or ice cubes to the area for about 15 minutes or until it feels numb. Re-apply three to five times daily or as needed.


If you don't any ice in the house, then consider using a frozen bag of fruit or veggies as cold therapy.
Always cover ice and frozen gel packs with a thin cloth to avoid frostbite on your skin.

, In addition to cold therapy, another way of combating the inflammation and pain of bursitis is by taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pills, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve).Take the pills before doing any activities. Medication is a short-term solution for bursitis and should not extend beyond a few weeks in order to avoid side effects.


Side effects from anti-inflammatories includes stomach irritation, diarrhea, skin rash, blurred vision, and reduced kidney function.Take anti-inflammatories with food and ask your doctor about appropriate dosage — do not go over the recommended daily dose.

, While dealing with your trochanteric bursitis, you may need to rely on supportive devices, such as a walking cane. Temporary use of a walking cane will relieve pressure on your hip and help you combat the inflammation and pain.Use the cane on the side of the hip bursitis for support as you walk and stand. Make sure your cane is sized properly — you should be able to fully extend your elbow when your cane is supporting your weight.


If both hips are inflamed with bursitis, which is fairly unusual, consider using crutches or a supportive walker instead of a cane.
Canes can be purchased as most pharmacies and medical supply stores. Ask your doctor or chiropractor for more information.

, Losing weight is not a short-term fix to be able to cope with trochanteric bursitis, but it can make a big difference in the long run, especially if your bursitis is chronic and keeps reoccurring. Excessive body weight puts more pressure on the hip joints and increases the likelihood of arthritis and bone spurs developing — major risk factors for hip bursitis.Any weight-bearing exercise (such as walking) tends to be very painful with bursitis, so consider swimming as an activity to lose weight because your body is essentially weightless once in the water.
In addition to burning more calories with exercise, you should also consume less calories via diet to have the best chance to lose weight.
Eat more fresh veggies, lean fish, low-fat dairy and whole grains. Avoid processed foods. Drink more water and less soda pop and energy drinks.

, If your hip bursitis doesn't go away within a few weeks and doesn't get better with home care, then your doctor may recommend a corticosteroid injection directly into the hip bursa to relieve the inflammation and pain.Corticosteroid injections, such as triamcinolone, methylprednisolone or cortisone, are powerful anti-inflammatories that act quickly.


Injections are given in your doctor's office and often one is all it takes for rapid relief that can last for months or completely resolve the problem.
If the bursitis returns, another injection or two can be given, but few months time between treatments is recommended to reduce the risk of side effects.
Side effects from corticosteroid injections include potential tendon/muscle weakening, local infection, water retention and weight gain, and reduced immune system function.

, If your doctor doesn't recommend steroid injections (or they didn't help much), then he will likely give you a referral to a physical therapist so she can teach you about specific exercises to increase the strength of your hip joint and show you various stretches to improve flexibility.The physical therapist may also use therapeutic ultrasound on your hip joint, which can alleviate symptoms and potentially shrink the inflamed bursa.


The physical therapist will also specifically focus on IT Band stretching and strengthening as this is the primary source of inflammation in bursitis of the greater trochanter.
Physiotherapy is usually required three times per week for three to four weeks to make a significant impact on hip bursitis.
Once you've learned the exercises and stretches for your hip, you can continue them at home if they are effective.

, Sometimes with severe and stubborn cases of trochanteric bursitis, surgery may be necessary. Surgical treatments of trochanteric bursitis typically consist of open vs. arthroscopic debridement (cleaning out) of the bursa, lengthening of the IT band, or windowing of the IT band to prevent the friction between the IT band and the greater trochanter itself.

, The main symptom of trochanteric bursitis is sharp and stabbing pain on the outside (lateral) part of your hip, near your upper buttocks.It can develop over the course of a day or two, usually due to overuse or some sort of accident, such as falling on your hip.


There are actually two bursa in your hip joint. The most commonly inflamed is the one covering the greater trochanter.
The other hip bursa, called the iliopsoas bursa, is located on the inside part of the hip joint (groin side) and causes groin pain when it's inflamed., The pain of hip bursitis typically feels pretty good when you wake up in the morning (assuming you don't irritate it in the night by laying on it), but invariably gets worse with any type of activity that involves walking, running or lifting and twisting.That's why icing, stretching and popping anti-inflammatory pills should all be done first thing in the morning to combat symptoms.


Hip pain with any sort of activity can also be caused by inflammatory (rheumatoid) arthritis, which bursitis is sometimes confused for.
With both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis of the hip, you will experience pain and stiffness in the morning. It is more pronounced in rheumatoid arthritis, lasting more than 30 minutes after getting up in the morning prior to loosening up, where with osteoarthritis, stiffness for less than 10–15 minutes after rising in the morning.
Your doctor will take an x-ray of your hip to see what role (if any) arthritis or joint damage plays with your bursitis.

, Another major sign of bursitis is swelling or a ""boggy"" feeling on the outside of the hip joint that can be felt and often seen.Pushing on the outside part of your hip with your fingers should cause pain and leave an indentation for a few seconds due to the swelling — this is similar to pitting edema (swelling) that can develop in the ankles.


The head of the greater trochanter can be fairly close to the skin's surface, which is why the inflamed bursa may be easily felt and seen.
Hip bursitis is sometimes confused with a hip infection, accept that bursitis doesn't cause a fever.
Don't mistake a large boil, rash or bruise for bursitis. Bursitis doesn't usually discolor the skin.

Changing to shoes that have wider toe boxes, better arch support and conform to the shape of your feet can certainly help prevent bunions (if not completely stop their progression), but it won't correct an already established bunion. Think in terms of prevention, not correction.


To minimize the risk of getting a bunion, never force your foot into a tight shoe that doesn't fit properly. For examples, most cowboy boots and some swing back sandals are too pointy in the toe for most people.
Get fitted for your shoes by a shoe salesperson later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.;
, Women are often expected or pressured to wear high heels for many jobs and due to fashion trends, but heels more than 2 inches high can force the body to tilt forward, which creates lots of pressure in the feet and toes, as well as strain in the low back.In addition, high heels are almost always far too narrow for most people's toes.


Avoid shoes that are short, tight or sharply pointed, and those with heels higher than 2 inches. You should be able to wiggle your toes while your shoes are on.
Wearing completely level shoes is not the answer either, because too much pressure is put on the heel, so wear shoes that are elevated in the heel by about 1/4 or 1/2 inch.
About 90% of bunions happen to women, mainly due to their poor choices of footwear., Avoiding the latest trends and choosing shoes tailored to your foot size and shape is a great strategy to help prevent bunions. Go for sturdy shoes with wide, supportive insteps, broad toe boxes and durable soles.Make sure that they grip your heels tightly, provide enough room to wiggle your toes and have enough interior support to prevent pronation (the rolling inward or collapsing of your ankle). Most good quality athletic or walking shoes with wide toe caps are good choices.


There should be at least 1/2 inch of space between the tips of your big toes and the end of your shoes while you're standing up.
Select shoes with a soft leather upper that will stretch and give naturally with your walking motion. Shoes with good arch support or using arch support insoles can also be helpful to prevent bunions.
In addition to ill-fitting shoes, other risk factors for bunions include certain foot types (flat feet, long toes, loose joints), previous foot injuries such as broken toes, and foot deformities present at birth., Instead of restricting your feet in shoes, sandals or slippers, spend more time walking barefoot. Walking in bare feet will widen your feet, improve balance and strengthen your toes with time. Walking barefoot makes the big toe work harder while toeing off during normal gait, which forces the tendons and ligaments to get stronger — potentially reducing the risk of bunions.When you first go barefoot, start walking on softer surfaces around the house, such as rug or wood floors with some give or springiness, so as to not create too much force on your feet.
As your feet grow accustomed to walking barefoot, progress to harder surfaces both inside and outside your home, but be careful to avoid insect bites and puncture wounds.

, If you notice your toe is swollen and painful after exercise or a day at work, then apply something cold in order to reduce the inflammation. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including bunions.Cold therapy should be applied to your toe for 10-15 minutes every 2-3 hours until the pain and swelling subside. Cold therapy should be used in conjunction with changing your shoes to wider, more supportive types.


Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.
If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer.

, If you notice a big toe is becoming a little crooked, then consider applying a splint for structural support, especially at night while you sleep. Taping a plastic, wooden or metal splint around the affected toe might help reduce the pain and realign the joint, depending on how advanced the bunion is.A bunion splint acts as a holder for the big toe and is positioned in a longitudinal direction over the toe, which results in a corrective force being applied. However, splints are mainly for prevention and are not meant to completely reverse a bunion. You may want to check with your doctor or podiatrist before using a splint. Make sure you use water-resistant medical tape so you can bathe with the splint on. Splints can be found at most medical supply or rehabilitation-type stores.


As an economically friendlier alternative, consider making your own splint with Popsicle sticks and duct tape.
Rigid splints are usually considered night-time splints because the materials don't flex and cannot bear weight.
Silicone or felt pads worn on the feet may also relieve bunion pain, but it depends on the degree of crookedness and joint damage.

, In general, people who are overweight or obese suffer more foot problems such as bunions because of the increased amount of pressure on their feet.Flat feet, fallen arches, severe pronation, and ""knock knees"" (medically known as genu valgum) are much more common among the obese and are risk factors for bunion formation. As such, do your feet a favor by losing any excess weight. In short, you can lose weight by increasing cardiovascular exercise (such as walking) while decreasing your caloric consumption.


Most people who are relatively sedentary only require about 2,000 calories per day to maintain their body processes and have enough energy for mild levels of exercise.
Reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories daily will result in about 4 pounds of fat tissue loss per month., A podiatrist is a foot specialist who can properly evaluate your toes and tell you whether you have a bunion or if you're at risk of developing one. A podiatrist can prescribe custom-made shoes or orthotics (shoe inserts) for your feet in order to support your arches, provide shock absorption and reduce the pressure on your big toes. Custom orthotics can be expensive without medical coverage, but off-the-shelf insoles may provide preventative benefit also.


You may have to buy shoes a little bigger than you normally would in order to accommodate the orthotics.
Some medical doctors, chiropractors and physical therapists also make custom shoe orthotics.
Your podiatrist may recommend surgery if your bunions are severe or you don't improve with conservative treatment.
Some research indicates that bunions may have a hereditary link, which means you may have a genetic predisposition to developing them., Chiropractors and osteopaths are joint specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of spinal and peripheral joints, such as those in your feet. Manual joint manipulation (or adjustment) can be used to unjam or reposition toe joints that are slightly misaligned, which usually triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a joint adjustment.


Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely realign your crooked toe, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.
A slightly dislocated toe can sometimes be mistaken for a bunion (or vice versa), but your chiropractor or osteopath can tell the difference and treat both appropriately.

, A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your toes and feet, and if need be, treat any inflamed joints with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound.A physical therapist may also tape your toes / feet with medical-grade tape in order to relieve symptoms by providing support for the joints, tendons and ligaments.


Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic joint problems.
Good strengthening exercises for your feet / toes include walking barefoot, standing on your tiptoes for 10-20 seconds at a time, and trying to pick up items from the floor with your toes — such as a thin hand towel or pencil, for examples.

Consider physiotherapy treatments.",How to Avoid Fallen Arches," Flat feet from childhood don't usually cause significant symptoms, although having your arches fall or flatten as an adult is typically more problematic. The most common symptoms due to fallen arches is sharp and burning pain throughout the arch and into the heel area, although other symptoms include: calf, knee and/or low back pain, swelling around the ankles, difficulty standing on tiptoes and inability to jump high or run fast.Common issues associated with fallen arches include plantar fasciitis (inflammation), chronic foot fatigue and increased risk of arthritis of the foot / ankle.
Fallen arches are not always bilateral — it can occur in only one foot, especially after suffering a broken ankle or foot.;
, One of the biggest risk factors for fallen arches is obesity, especially if combined with wearing unsupportive shoes.The more weight you put on your frame, the more pressure the bones, ligaments and tendons of your feet have to endure. Too much pressure leads to overstretching and damage to the posterior tibial tendon, which runs from the calf muscle along the inside of the ankle and terminates within the arch of the foot. This tendon is the most important part of the arch because it provides the most support or ""spring.""


Many obese people have fallen arches and tend to over-pronate their ankles (the joints collapse and turn in), which then leads to a knock-knee posture.
Losing weight won't reverse fallen arches in most cases, but it will make a positive impact on foot symptoms and biomechanics (movement).
The key to losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight is reducing your daily calories. You will need to calculate your basal metabolic rate and strive to eat fewer calories than you burn every day.

, Wearing sturdy shoes with good arch support won't completely eliminate the risk of fallen arches, but it will certainly make a positive impact on your feet and reduce tendon strain.Avoid flimsy shoes, flip flops and high heels (greater than 2.25 inches), especially if you're on the heavy side. Instead, choose comfortable walking or athletic shoes with substantial arch support, a roomy toe box, firm heel counter and a flexible sole. Furthermore, make sure the materials of your shoes are somewhat breathable — leather and suede are good choices.


Get fitted for your shoes later in the day because that's when your feet are at their largest, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.
You should have enough room in the toe box of your shoes to be able to wiggle your toes.

, Soaking your feet in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle and/or tendon strain.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles and other soft tissues to relax. The warm salt bath is more for symptom relief and prevention of plantar fasciitis than it is for directly preventing fallen arches, but anything that promotes health in the feet is a good idea. About 30 minutes spent soaking on a nightly basis is a good starting point.


If swelling is a particular problem in your feet after a day at work, then follow the warm salt bath with a quick ice bath until your feet feel numb (about 10 to 15 minutes).
Sometimes women develop fallen arches during the later stages of pregnancy that then recover once the baby is born.
It’s considered normal for children to have flat feet until the age of five years (and sometimes as late as 10 years) because it takes time for the bones, ligaments and tendons of the foot to form a supportive arch., Give yourself a foot massage on a regular basis. Getting at your arches may prove a little awkward, so buy a small wooden roller with ridges that's made for massaging feet. Place it under your feet while sitting down and roll back and forth over it while applying light pressure. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate muscle and tendon strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with 10-15 minutes worth on a nightly basis and progress up to 30 minutes after a few weeks time


As an alternative to a wooden roller, position a tennis ball underneath your foot and roll on it slowly for 10 to 15 minutes a few times daily until the soreness in your arches fades away.
After the foot massage, stretch the sole of your foot by wrapping a towel around the end of your toes and then trying to extend your leg — hold for 30 seconds and repeat of few times.
Consider applying peppermint lotion to your feet after massaging them — it will tingle and invigorate them.

, Since arch support is the best strategy for avoiding fallen arches, consider getting custom-made orthotics for your shoes. Orthotics are semi-rigid shoe inserts that not only support the arch of your foot, but they also combat over-pronation and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking and running.By providing cushioning and some shock absorption, orthotics also help to reduce the risk of problems developing in your ankles, knees, hips and low back.


It's important to realize that foot orthotics don't reverse any structural deformities of the foot nor can they reconstruct an arch by wearing them over time, but they are a good preventative strategy for avoiding fallen arches.
A variety of different healthcare professionals make custom orthotics, but they are not always covered by health insurance, so check your policy.
Wearing orthotics often requires taking the shoes original insoles out in order to make enough room for your feet.

, Podiatrists are foot specialist who are familiar with all conditions and diseases of the feet, including fallen arches. Podiatrists can examine your foot and try to determine the risk factors that contributed to your flat feet.They will also look for any signs of bone trauma (fractures or dislocations), possibly with the help of x-rays. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the cause of your fallen arches, the foot doctor may recommend basic home care (rest, salt baths, cold therapy, anti-inflammatory medications), orthotic therapy, casting or bracing the foot, or some form of surgery for the tendons of the feet.


X-rays are ideal for seeing bones, but they are not diagnostic for soft tissue problems affecting tendons and ligaments.
Podiatrists are trained for relatively minor operations of the feet, but more complex surgeries are usually reserved for orthopedic surgeons.

, If you're particularly concerned about developing fallen arches, then get a referral to a physical therapist and discuss how rehabilitation might help prevent them. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your feet, Achilles tendons and calf muscles that can help prevent fallen arches and other common foot problems.Physiotherapy is usually a longer-term commitment for rehabilitating most musculoskeletal issues, so plan on two to three times per week for four to eight weeks as a general guideline. Make sure that you do the exercises at home that your physical therapist teaches you, not just during your sessions together. This is the best way to see improvement.


A good Achilles tendon stretch involves leaning against a wall with one leg at a time outstretched behind you in a lunge-like position. Make sure you keep the outstretched foot flat on the floor to feel a stretch in the tendon that connects your calf muscle to your heel. Hold for about 30 seconds and repeat five to 10 times daily.
Physical therapists can tape your foot with sturdy medical-grade tape, which essentially provides a temporary artificial arch to help relieve symptoms.
Physical therapists can also treat plantar fasciitis (a common complication of fallen arches) with therapeutic ultrasound, which helps to reduce inflammation and tenderness.

Eat more slowly.,
Focus on your meal.,
Ease up on the condiments.,
Avoid processed foods.",How to Develop More Sensitive Taste Buds1," Slow down and enjoy what you’re eating. It helps to treat this like an exercise: concentrate on your food as you chew, mentally thinking about its texture and flavor. Otherwise, you may be missing out on crucial stimulus and the more subtle flavors in your meals., Unless you’ve always been a foodie, you might find that eating is a bit boring. Many of us have the TV playing in the background while we eat, or worse, eat at our desk during work. These distractions make your digestive system 30 to 40 percent less efficient when it’s time to break down food.You’re missing out on flavors you should be enjoying, and also making it more likely that your meal will cause gas, bloating and constipation. Make sure you do the following when eating:


No electronics. Keep the TV off and don’t eat at the computer.
Get comfortable. Sit down at a table, and make sure you are comfortable as this will encourage you to take your time when you eat.

, Don’t reach for the ketchup or BBQ sauce as soon as it’s time to eat. Over-complicating your meals by adding condiments robs you of the chance to savor a food’s texture and flavors. While an appropriate sauce can complement a food’s natural taste, you shouldn’t be slathering all your meals with condiments, as it desensitizes your taste buds.

, Salt and sugar can overstimulate your taste buds when ingested in high enough quantities, leaving them desensitized to other flavors.Many processed foods, be they chips, cereal or ketchup, have an abundance of both these substances. Make an active effort to limit the presence of processed foods in your diet and your taste buds will start regaining their sensitivity. As you do this, keep the following in mind:


While technically processed foods, meat and dairy products are processed for safety reasons. Don’t feel the need to avoid them.Try to avoid foods that come bagged or boxed, such as cookies, chips or cereal.
Avoid frozen foods, even frozen fruits and vegetables. They are less preferable than their fresh counterparts.

Visit an emergency room if you think you need immediate treatment or if you cannot get in to see your regular doctor. When your doctor examines you, she will ask you questions and check for certain signs to determine the degree and type of injury that you have. Be honest about your pain and other symptoms to help your doctor diagnose and treat your injury. The grades of common, low ankle injury include:


Grade I is a partial tear of the ligament with no functional loss or impairment. The person can still walk and bear weight on the affected side. You may have some mild pain and mild bruising.Grade II is an incomplete tear of the ligament or ligaments with moderate functional impairment, meaning it is difficult to bear weight on the affected foot and you may need crutches. You will have some moderate pain, bruising, and swelling. Your doctor may also notice some limitations in your range of motion.Grade III is a complete tear and loss of the structural integrity of the ligaments. The patient will be unable to bear any weight or walk unassisted. You will have severe bruising and severe swelling.;
, Common ankle sprains involve the ATFL ligament, which stabilizes the ankle and is commonly injured by ""rolling"" the ankle.These injuries are ""low ankle"" sprains, but you may also experience a ""high ankle"" sprain, especially if you are an athlete. This affects a different ligament, the syndesmosis, which is located above the ankle joint. You will experience less bruising and swelling with this kind of injury, but likely more pain and a longer recover time., After you have had your swollen ankle evaluated, you will need to stick to your doctor’s treatment plan to cure your ankle. Your doctor will most likely recommend a period of resting, icing, compressing, and elevating your ankle. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if they do not improve over time.


Ask about physical therapy if you have a severe injury. Physical therapy may help to speed up your healing time and exercise reduces the chances that you will sprain your ankle again., Making sure your ankle gets plenty of rest for two or three days will help to speed up your recovery time. This means avoiding sports or other physical activities that involve putting pressure on your ankle. You may need to take some time off from work if you have a job where you need to stay on your feet for most of the day., Apply ice to your ankle for 15–20 minutes at a time to help reduce swelling and decrease pain. When you put ice on your ankle, it reduces the blood flow to the area so the swelling will go down faster. Icing your ankle can also help you to cope with the pain. Wrap the ice pack with a towel before pressing it against your skin.After icing your ankle, wait about an hour before icing your ankle again. Too much exposure to the ice could cause skin damage.

, By compressing your ankle, you will restrict the movement of your ankle. Compression decreases swelling and speeds healing time as well. Wrap an ace bandage or compression device around the injured area.Take the compression off at night. Overnight compression may cause total restriction of blood flow in the foot and cause tissue death.
Kinesio taping is another form of compression that has been shown to clinically reduce swelling. Ask your doctor or a physical therapist if he is trained in this technique.

, Elevation limits the flow of blood to the affected area, which may help to reduce the swelling. You can elevate your ankle when you are sitting or when you are lying down. Use a couple of pillows or blankets to prop up your ankle so you’re your ankle is raised above the level of your heart., Keeping pressure off your ankle by avoiding standing on it will help you to recover faster. You can use crutches or a cane to support yourself when you need to walk. Keep in mind that you need to support your ankle when going up and down stairs.


When going up steps, take the first step with your uninjured foot. The healthy leg shoulders all the load of the body while battling against gravity in this way.
When going down steps, take the first step with your injured foot. This allows gravity to assist the injured leg while stepping down.

, Following your doctor’s instructions and staying off of your injured ankle will help you to recover, but it often takes about 10 days for people to recover from ankle injuries.Do not try to rush your recovery or you may make your injury worse. Take time off from work if necessary and ask for help from friends and family while you recover.

, Talk to your doctor about taking NSAIDs to help you deal with pain as you recover. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work to reduce swelling and relieve the pain caused by your ankle injury. Common over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (Naprosyn).Talk to your doctor before using NSAIDs if you have heart problems, a history of stomach ulcers, high blood pressure, kidney damage, or diabetes.

, Celecoxib (Celebrex®) works well to reduce inflammation caused by an ankle injury. This is because it controls the production of prostaglandins, which cause inflammation. You will need a prescription from your doctor for this medication. You should take celecoxib after a meal, because taking it on an empty stomach could lead to a stomachache., Piroxicam works by stopping prostaglandin formation. It has a sublingual form that melts under the tongue and goes directly to the blood so that it reduces swelling quickly., Surgical therapy is rarely done for ankle sprains. It is only done in severe ankle sprains that do not respond to months of rehabilitation and medical therapy. If your ankle sprain is severe and has not improved after a long period of rehabilitation, ask your doctor if this may be a good option for you.

, Avoid heat while your ankle recovers. Heat increases blood flow to the injured area and aggravates inflammation. Warm compresses, saunas, and steam showers may do more harm than good in the first three days after your injury occurs. Stay away from heat during this time and stick to cold compresses to help relieve pain and swelling., Do not drink any alcohol while you are recovering. Alcoholic drinks open up the blood vessels in the body. When your blood vessels open up, the swelling in your ankle can become much worse. Alcohol will also delay the healing process, so it is a good idea to avoid it while you recover.

, Stay away from running and other physical activities to make sure that your ankle heals. Running and other high impact physical activities will only make things worse. Rest for at least one week before resuming exercise.

, Do not massage your ankle for at least a week. While massaging the pain away in your ankle might sound like a good idea, giving your ankle a massage will just add external pressure to your injury. This external pressure will actually make the swelling worse.


You can start to gently massage your ankle one week after you have allowed your ankle to rest and recover.

Go to a doctor if you notice any of the symptoms listed in this article.,
Be aware that there are three grades of ACL injury.,
Have a doctor perform the Lachman test.,
Be prepared for the Pivot Shift test.,
Have an x-ray taken of your knee.,
Know that an MRI might need to be done.",How to Confirm a Partial ACL Tear2," While you may be able to use this article as a guide to help you figure out if you are injured, you still must go to the doctor to get a professional diagnosis. It would be bad to think that you are ok, only to put pressure on your knee and injure it further.


Schedule an appointment for as soon as possible after the injury. If you can, you may also go to the hospital to deal with the injury right away.

, When your ACL gets injured, it is referred to as a sprain rather than a broken bone because it is a ligament (though it can feel as painful as breaking a bone). The term 'sprain' refers to more than just the stretching of the ligament, it is actually the classification the is used to refer to ligament injuries. There are three levels of ACL injury.


A grade 1 ACL sprain involves mild injury to the ligament. It has been slightly stretched but not torn. It can still sustain the knee joint and will help the leg remain stable.
A grade 2 ACL sprain is when the ligament is stretched beyond its capacity to the point it becomes loose. This is when the technical term “partial tear of the ACL” is used.
A grade 3 ACL sprain makes the knee joint unstable and the ligament is completely torn apart.

, You must have a doctor do this test—do not try it yourself. This is the preferred test for figuring out if you have a partial ACL tear because it can show that you have a partial tear even when the rest of the ligaments and tendons in your knee are uninjured. A doctor will:


Have you lie down on a table. Your doctor will first look at your uninjured knee to see how far your shin moves forward when your knee is bent. Your ACL keeps your shin from moving very far forward. Your doctor will then look at your injured knee and see how far your shin moves forward when the knee is bent. If it moves forward further than normal but your doctor can still feel resistance, it means that you have a partial tear. If there is no resistance, your ACL has been fully torn.

, This test is meant to determine how much pressure can be put on your injured knee before it becomes unstable. Your doctor will move your injured leg a little ways away from your body (this is called hip abduction).She will then:


Straighten your leg while simultaneously press inward against the outer part of your knee and twist your leg outward. Doing this will show how well your ACL is functioning because it is a movement that only involves the ACL.
Your leg will be slowly bent while continuous pressure is put on it. When your knee is bent at a 20 to 40° angle, your doctor will look at your shin bone. If the bone slides forward a bit it means that your ACL has been partially torn.

, While the ACL cannot be seen through an x-ray, your doctor can look for other evidence that you ACL has been partially torn. An x-ray of both knees is necessary to detect signs of injury such as fracture, improper alignment of the bony structures, and narrowing of the spaces between joints.All three of these injuries are associated with a partial ACL tear.

, Unlike an x-ray, an MRI will help your doctor to examine your soft tissue structures in your knee, including your ACL. Your doctor will also look at your meniscus and other knee ligaments to make sure that they are not injured.


Your doctor might also request an oblique coronal image if he or she is still not sure about the extent of your injury. This image will give the doctor a better view of your knee in addition to the MRI.

Protect your knee with a brace or cast.,
Rest your knee as much as possible.,
Ice your knee.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.,
Go to physical therapy to strengthen your knee.",How to Confirm a Partial ACL Tear3," If you do have a partial ACL tear, your doctor will most likely give you a brace or cast to wear while your ACL recovers. Luckily, most partial ACL tears do not require surgery. You will, however, have to protect your knee from further injury. The best way to do this is to wear a brace or cast that will keep your knee stabilized while it heals.


Your doctor might give you crutches to use along with your brace. Crutches are used to keep you from putting pressure or too much weight on your knee while it heals.

, While your knee is healing, it will need to rest as much as possible. Try to keep weight off of it at all times. You should sit with your knee elevated so that it can begin to repair itself. When you sit down, prop your knee up so that it is raised above your hip.


If you are lying down, prop your knee and leg up so that it is above your heart and chest.

, To control the swelling and pain caused by your partially torn ACL, you will need to ice your knee every day. Write a bag of ice or an ice pack in a towel to keep the ice from directly touching your skin, as this could cause a burn. Keep the ice on your knee for 15 to 20 minutes for the best results.Any amount of time shorter than 15 minutes will not do much to control swelling or pain. Keeping the ice on your knee for longer than 20 minutes may result in the ice burning your skin.

, If your ACL is fully torn, or if your tear falls between a partial and full tear, you may need surgery for the knee to be fully repaired. If this is the case, you will have to have a graft done to replace the torn ligament. The most common graft used is the tendon of the kneecap or hamstring. However, acquiring tendons from donor knee is also an option.


Talk to your doctor about the best option for your specific case.

, Talk to your doctor about going to physical therapy. After you have let your knee heal, you will have to begin rehabilitating your knee so that the injury does not occur again. Go to a physical therapist who can help you with increasing your range of motion, strength training, and stability exercises."

Step outside of your comfort zone.,
Cleanse your palate between courses.,
Try different spices.,
Improve your sense of smell.,
Stop smoking.,
Attend tasting events.",How to Develop More Sensitive Taste Buds2," Eating the same meals consistently can affect the way we taste.Get out of this rut and actively try to experience different foods. A great way to start this process is by seeking out renowned foods from different cultures. Whether it’s Indian Curry, Lebanese Humus or a Pad Thai, try to find restaurants that prepare genuine cultural specialties.

, Strong tastes can linger on your taste buds and affect the way you taste each course. As such, you essentially have to “reset” them between courses. You can do this in a few ways:


Sip lukewarm water.
Suck on an orange slice.
Snack on a soda cracker or bread stick., Don’t go slathering all your meals in hot sauce. Even if you might not be a master chef, you should consider expanding the contents of your spice rack, which will liven up your meals tremendously. A great start is with a classic marinara sauce. You can add oregano one week, swapping it for thyme or basil in the following weeks.Once you understand how different spices affect your meals, you can branch out and perform the same experiment with different foods.

, Your sense of smell plays a vital role in how you taste different foods. As you eat, chemicals are released that reach olfactory receptors in your nose, which combine with your tastebuds to create the flavors you know.Here are a few ways to improve your sense of smell:


Exercise. Our sense of smell is most attuned right after exercise, this will make you more sensitive to the way your food tastes.
Eat only when you’re hungry. Your sense of smell is much more sensitive when you are at your hungriest., Long-term smoking can damage the nerves that detect smells. Do this gradually, and ask your doctor for recommendations on how to quit smoking.

, Wine and cheese tasting are the most common, as they are known for having strong tastes with subtle differences. For instance, you might be able to tell the difference between a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Pinot Noir, but might not be able to describe each flavor accurately. Attending these types of events exposes you to people with refined palates, which will let you learn the language used when describing flavors, as well as letting you experience them for yourself. You can find these events through a quick online search through directories such as Local Wine Events.

Choose the correct vegetables.,
Select the right fruits.,
Talk to your doctor about your protein requirements.,
Prepare foods in a heart healthy manner.",How to Create a Kidney Diet to Reverse Chronic Kidney Disease1," When you're eating with kidney disease, you need to be conscientious of your vegetable intake. While vegetables are vital to a healthy diet, not all vegetables are safe for you if you have compromised kidneys. Vegetables high in potassium should generally be avoided when you have kidney problems.Good vegetable choices include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, celery, onions, pepper, zucchini, and yellow squash.
You should avoid potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, asparagus, pumpkin, winter squash, and cooked spinach. These options have a lot of potassium.
If you need to limit potassium, then make sure to avoid high potassium vegetables, such as potatoes. Instead, choose low potassium ones, like cucumbers and radishes.;
, You should also be careful to watch out for fruits with high levels of potassium. Fruit is an important component of your diet when you have kidney disease, but be conscientious of what types of fruit you choose.Low potassium fruits include grapes, cherries, apples, pears, berries, plums, pineapples, tangerines, and watermelon.
Try to avoid oranges and orange-based products like orange juice. You should watch out for kiwis, nectarines, prunes, cantaloupe, honeydew, raisins, and dry fruit in general.
If you need to limit your potassium, then make sure to choose low potassium fruits, such as blueberries and raspberries.

, Protein is an important part of your diet, but you want to be careful with protein intake if you have kidney disease. If you get too much, then it may stress your kidneys. However, if you do not get enough, then it may cause you to feel tired. As protein produces waste in the body, and kidneys help remove waste, too much protein may put unneeded pressure on your kidneys. Your doctor may suggest a low protein diet. However, when undergoing dialysis, you may need to up your protein intake temporarily.Find out how much protein you are allowed to have per day and stick to this guideline.
Limit high protein foods to 5 to 7 ounces per day, or less if your dietitian tell you to. High protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs.
Watch for protein in other foods. Keep in mind that protein is also present in milk, cheese, yogurt, pasta, beans, nuts, bread, and cereals. Make sure to keep track of your total protein intake each day.
Try eating smaller servings of protein at dinner. Keep the bulk of your plate full of healthy fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates. A serving of protein should be no more than 3 ounces, which is about the size of a deck of cards.
High protein foods may be temporarily important during dialysis, so talk to your doctor if you're undergoing dialysis or will be in the future. You will want to eat high protein foods. Many doctors suggest eggs or egg whites as a good source of protein during dialysis.

, How you cook your foods matters a lot when it comes to slowing or reversing kidney damage. Learn how to cook foods to make your diet healthier overall.

Use non-stick pans when you cook to cut back on your need for butter and cooking oils, which can add a lot of unneeded calories and fat to your diet. Use heart healthy fats like olive oil when cooking over butter or vegetable oil.
When you eat, trim excess fat from meat. You should also remove the skin from poultry.
When preparing food, aim to bake, stir-fry, grill, or boil food.

Signs of mild to moderate dehydration include thirst, dry or sticky mouth, crying unaccompanied by tears, infrequent urination, dark yellow urine, skin that feels dry and cool, headache, and muscle cramps.
Signs of severe dehydration include sunken eyes, lethargy, irritability, fatigue, dizziness, rapid pulse, and unconsciousness. A sunken soft spot on top of an infant's head is another sign of severe dehydration.;
, The age of the child will determine how much to provide, but as a general guideline, prepare the solution as directed on the product label and give the child a spoonful or sip every few minutes.


Oral rehydration solutions provide balanced doses of water and salts, so they rehydrate while simultaneously replenishing lost electrolytes.
Use a spoon or syringe to give your child 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of prepared oral rehydration solution every few minutes. Continue for at least 3 to 4 hours, or until the child's urine becomes clear in color. Increase the amount gradually as vomiting subsides.Note that room temperature fluids might be easiest to swallow, especially if your child is vomiting or nauseous.

, If your baby is still on breastmilk or formula, continue feeding it to him or her. You may need to give smaller amounts at more frequent intervals if your baby has a hard time keeping fluids down.For formula-fed babies suffering with diarrhea, switch to a lactose-free formula until symptoms improve. Lactose can be difficult to digest and may worsen the diarrhea, thereby worsening the dehydration, too.
Do not dilute formula any further than the instructions or your doctor advise.
You may need to alternate both oral rehydration solution and breastmilk/formula. Consider giving your baby a sip of oral rehydration solution each time you offer him or her a bottle of breastmilk or formula.

, Certain foods and drinks can make dehydration worse, so it's important to avoid giving them to your child until he or she improves.Plain water can actually be dangerous when a child is dehydrated. The body loses salts and minerals during dehydration, and plain water can dilute this already low concentration of essential minerals even further.
Similarly, sports drinks replenish lost electrolytes, but only those lost through sweating. If your child is dehydrated due to diarrhea or vomiting, sports drinks will not be able to replenish the minerals he or she has lost.
Avoid milk, caffeine, undiluted fruit juice, and gelatin. Caffeine worsens dehydration. Milk, fruit juice, and gelatin can worsen the vomiting or diarrhea causing your child's dehydration, thereby making the condition more severe.

, Once you succeed in rehydrating the child, you should continue monitoring his or her condition closely. Careful treatment may prevent another episode of dehydration.


Increase the amount of fluids your child intakes while ill, especially if he or she suffers with diarrhea or vomiting. Breastmilk and formula are best for infants. Cold water, popsicles, diluted juice, and ice chips are best for older children.
Avoid foods that may make vomiting and dehydration worse. These include fatty foods, foods high in sugar, lean meats, complex carbohydrates, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.
Fevers and sore throats can make it more difficult for children to intake fluids, so children suffering with these symptoms may also be given acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

, Mild to moderate dehydration in adults can usually be cured at home without much risk of complication, but severe dehydration will require emergency medical care.Adults with mild to moderate dehydration may experience increased thirst, a dry or sticky mouth, difficulty urinating, dark yellow urine, skin that feels dry or cool to the touch, headaches, and muscle cramps.
Adults experiencing severe dehydration will likely have a lack of urination, amber-colored urine, shriveled skin, irritability, confusion, dizziness, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, listlessness, shock, delirium, or unconsciousness.

, Plain water and drinks containing electrolytes are your best options. As a general rule, you should drink as much as you can without making any nausea or vomiting worse.


Most adults need between 2 and 3 quarts (2 and 3 liters) of fluids per day.
If you're dehydrated due to nausea or a sore throat, try sucking on ice chips or popsicles made from juices and sports drinks.
Electrolyte imbalance is not as grave a danger in adults as it is in children, but it's still something worth noting. Consider drinking oral rehydration solutions or sports drinks to help replenish some of the electrolytes your body loses when it becomes dehydrated. Oral rehydration solutions are best if you're dehydrated due to illness, but sports drinks work well if you're dehydrated due to overexertion.

, Acute dehydration is often caused by exposure to excessive heat or accompanied by an elevated body temperature. In either circumstance, you should try to cool down to prevent the body from losing additional water content.Remove excess clothing and loosen necessary clothing so that it doesn't smother the skin.
Sit in a cool area. Move into an air-conditioned building if possible. If this isn't possible, sit in the shade outdoors or sit near an electric fan indoors.
Cool the skin with water. Place a wet towel around the neck or on the forehead. Mist exposed skin with lukewarm water using a spray bottle.
Note that the cooling process must happen gradually. Exposure to excessive cold can cause the blood vessels to body to shiver, thereby raising its internal temperature. For this reason, do not attempt to use ice packs or ice water to cool the skin.

, When dehydration is caused by vomiting or diarrhea, you should try to control these symptoms through diet and medication to prevent any additional loss of water.In many cases, over-the-counter loperamide can control diarrhea. Do not use this medication if you have a fever or if there is blood mixed in with the diarrhea, however.
Use acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for help controlling any fever you might have. Ibuprofen can irritate the stomach lining and may make vomiting worse.
Stick with clear fluids, including broths and gelatins, for the first 24 hours. As the vomiting and diarrhea subside, gradually reintroduce bland foods back into your diet.

, The average adult male needs approximately 13 cups (3 L) of fluid daily, while the average adult woman needs about 9 cups (2.2 L).Increase your fluid intake to match or slightly exceed these ideal amounts.


Water is important, but these recommendations refer to the overall amount of necessary fluid and not the necessary amount of plain water.
That being said, certain beverages are better than others. Water, herbal tea, juice, sports drinks, and other electrolyte beverages will help hydrate you, but drinks with caffeine (coffee, soda, black tea) or alcohol can actually make dehydration worse.

, Fruits and vegetables with high water content can help replenish lost fluids. Since these foods also contain nutrients, salts, and sugars, they can help restore the proper balance of electrolytes, too.Bananas are a notably excellent choice. The water content of a banana can be as high as 75 percent, and they're also rich in potassium, a mineral that tends to decrease as dehydration worsens.
Additional fruits and vegetables worth consuming for the sake of hydration include watermelon, tomatoes, grapes, peaches, cantaloupe, strawberries, cranberries, apples, blackberries, apricots, cucumbers, broccoli, and zucchini.

, Chamomile tea, in particular, can be especially helpful when treating chronic dehydration. Nearly any herbal tea or other naturally decaffeinated tea can help replenish lost water content, however.


Chamomile tea is considered to be a natural pain reliever, which is one main it is recognized as a powerful treatment for dehydration. As the body becomes dehydrated, stomach muscles may begin cramping. Chamomile tea is an effective way to rehydrate the body while treating those cramps.

, Coconut water is rich in electrolytes, so it can actually be better for chronic dehydration than standard water.


Among other nutrients, it contains notable amounts of iron and potassium. Both of these nutrients tend to be depleted as the body grows more dehydrated.
Note that coconut water is different from coconut milk. For the sake of curing dehydration, coconut water is the better option of the two.

, Fill the bathtub with hot water and dissolve 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of Epsom salts. Once the salt dissolves, soak in the bath for roughly 15 minutes.Your body can absorb magnesium from the bathwater through the skin, which may reduce any inflammation, fatigue, or soreness caused by chronic dehydration.The sulfates in the salt water can also aid in your body's ability to absorb nutrients, which may make it easier for your body to correct its electrolyte levels.

Each meal should consist of 1 carbohydrate portion and 1 protein portion.
The portions should match the size of your palm if you’re eating meat, or the size of your closed fist for bulkier foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.;
,


Start the Atkins diet by going through Induction. During this period, you will eat no more than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day, and that total should contain 12 to 15 grams of carbohydrates from foundation vegetables.
Continue into Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL). After the 2-week Induction period, gradually add carbohydrates to your daily total to find your carbohydrate level for weight loss (CLL).
Start Pre-Maintenance after OWL. When you are within 10 pounds of your goal weight, continue adding carbohydrates to your daily total until your weight loss slows to a crawl. This will help you to determine your carbohydrate equilibrium that you can utilize in Lifetime Maintenance.
Progress to Lifetime Maintenance. Eat the number of carbohydrates each day that you can safely consume without losing or gaining weight.

Try the lemonade cleanse.,
Try the apple and ginger cleanse.,
Do a salt water flush.,
Try the green smoothie cleanse.",How to Cleanse Your Body Naturally1," The lemonade cleanse, also known as the ""master cleanse"", is one of the most popular and well-known cleanses, thanks to several celebrity advocates. The lemonade cleanse involves making a drink out of water, lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper which you will consume exclusively for a period of between three and ten days. The lemonade cleanse is intended to help you flush toxins from your system, while also effectively aiding weight loss.To make one glass of the lemonade, mix four tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice, half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of organic maple syrup into a ten ounce glass of water. Make four to five times this quantity to make enough to last you an entire day.Be aware that most medical experts do not recommend this cleanse as it creates a serious calorie and nutrient deficit that can have a negative impact on health. It is also not scientifically proven to effectively flush out toxins.;
, This cleanse is a less intense version of the lemonade cleanse, as it only needs to be completed one day a week and may be accompanied by some light, healthy snacks. In addition to the apple and ginger, this recipe also includes psyllium husk - a type of dietary fiber which is said to effectively bind waste material together, making it easier for the waste to be flushed from the system.To make the juice cleanse, combine eight ounces of freshly-pressed or organic apple juice with one teaspoon each of ground ginger and ground psyllium husk. Mix well with a spoon, or blend at a low speed.After drinking this mixture, you should continue to drink plenty of water throughout the day, as this will help to keep the digestive system moving.
Once again, this cleanse has not be scientifically proven to effectively remove toxins.

, Doing a salt water flush is another popular, if rather unpleasant, way to cleanse your system of built-up waste and toxins. Salt is a natural disinfectant which effectively flushes out the entire intestinal tract. In fact, this process is so effective that it is often used as a cost-effective alternative to expensive colonic irrigation procedures. The flush involves drinking a glass of salty water on an empty stomach, then waiting an hour or two as the solution flushes out your bowels, resulting in multiple eliminations.To make the salt solution, dissolve two level teaspoons of unrefined, non-iodized sea salt into one quart of lukewarm, purified water. Drink the solution first thing in the morning, as quickly as possible, using a straw if it helps.You should then lie on your right side for half an hour. This aids the passage of the salt water into the small intestine. At this point, you will feel the urge to eliminate, so make sure you are near a bathroom!Be aware that intense diarrhea and sometimes vomiting are not uncommon after a salt water flush. These symptoms are normal and should subside within an hour or two.The salt water flush is not recommended for people with digestive or kidney problems. If you have any concerns about doing it, you should consult your physician first., Drinking this smoothie is a great natural, healthy way to cleanse your body, without resorting to depriving yourself of essential nutrients or going hungry. All you need to do is replace one meal a day with this energy-boosting drink, to gain all of its digestion-friendly benefits.


Simply combine one cup of kale (with the stems removed), one coarsely chopped granny smith apple, one ripe banana and half a cup of fresh, flat-leafed parsley in a blender.Blend until smooth, adding a little water to thin the consistency, if necessary.

Manage your sodium intake carefully.,
Limit your phosphorus intake.,
Stay away from fried foods.",How to Create a Kidney Diet to Reverse Chronic Kidney Disease2," Sodium, more commonly known as salt, can be very damaging if you have kidney failure. It's vital you trim down on your sodium intake throughout the day. Cutting down on salt will cause less fluid retention in your body, and also help control blood pressure, all of which can help improve kidney disease.Buy foods with labels that read ""no salt added,"" ""sodium-free,"" or ""low-sodium.""
Check product labels to see how much sodium a food contains. Go for foods with less than 100mg of sodium per serving.
Do not use when you're cooking and don’t add salt to your food. If you have a salt shaker, remove it from the table altogether to avoid the temptation to salt your food during meals. Avoid salt substitutes as well unless your doctor or dietitian has said it is okay.
Avoid salty foods like pretzels, potato chips, popcorn, bacon, deli meats, hot dogs, cured meats, and canned meats and fish.
Steer clear of foods that contain MSG.
Cut back on how often you eat out. Foods in restaurants often contain more sodium than foods you prepare at home.

, Phosphorus levels in your blood should remain low if you have chronic kidney disease. Dairy products, like milk and cheese, are generally high in phosphorus. It's best to cut back on dairy if you're struggling with chronic kidney disease.When it comes to dairy foods, stick with your diet plan and do not exceed the recommended number of servings per day. You can also stick to low phosphorous dairy choices. Go for cream cheese, ricotta cheese, margarine, butter, heavy cream, sherbet, brie cheese, and whipped toppings that do not contain dairy.
As you need calcium for strong bones, talk to your doctor about calcium supplements. Many people who have chronic kidney disease need to take calcium supplements for their health and well-being.
You should also limit your intake of nuts, peanut butter, seeds, lentils, beans, organ meats, sardines, and cured meats such as sausages, bologna, and hot dogs.
Avoid drinking colas and soft drinks with phosphate or phosphoric acid in them.
Steer clear of bran breads and bran cereals as well.

, Fried foods should be avoided if you have kidney disease. Frying foods adds a lot of unnecessary calories and fat to your diet.When you're eating out, stay away from deep fried foods on the menu. Ask the waiter or waitress about altering items. For example, see if you can substitute a grilled chicken breast for a fried one on a sandwich.
At family get togethers, like holidays, stay away from fried foods. Opt for vegetables and fruits over things like fried chicken.
When cooking meals at home, do not fry your foods. If you have a deep-fryer, it may be best to give it away.

Check with your doctor to see if alcohol is okay in moderation.,
Find ways to manage thirst.,
Be careful with sodas.,
Limit your intake of orange juice.",How to Create a Kidney Diet to Reverse Chronic Kidney Disease3," Alcohol can take a great toll on the kidneys. If your kidneys are already compromised, drinking to excess is not recommended. If your kidney disease is advanced enough, you may not be able to drink alcohol at all. Some people with kidney disease can have one drink on occasion. However, you should talk to your doctor to get precise recommendations about how much alcohol is safe for you.If your doctor says it is okay to drink, then make sure you do not exceed one drink per day and count it as part of your fluid intake for the day.
Ask that friends and family members do not drink around you at social events. If you know a social event will involve drinking, try sitting that event out or asking a friend or family member to refrain from drinking with you.
If you struggle to give up alcohol, talk to a therapist about how to quit drinking. You can also seek out the support of groups like Alcoholics Anonymous if you believe you have a drinking problem.

, You may not have to limit your fluid intake early on, but many people have to cut down on fluid consumption in the later stages of kidney disease. If you are on dialysis, fluid can build up in the body between sessions. Your doctor may want you to stick within a certain range of fluids throughout the day. Look into ways to manage your thirst without drinking too much liquid.Drink from smaller glasses during meals. If you're at a restaurant, turn your cup over when you're done drinking. This will let your server know not to refill your cup, allowing you to avoid the temptation of drinking too much water.
You can try freezing fruit juices in ice trays. You can suck on these juices like popsicles, allowing you to alleviate your thirst slowly. Just make sure to count these popsicles towards your total fluid intake for the day.
If you need to limit your fluids, try using a pitcher to track the amount of fluid you are allowed to drink per day. Fill the pitcher with water and only drink from the pitcher throughout the day. If you have something else that counts as a fluid, such as coffee, milk, jello, or ice cream, then pour out the amount of water equal to what you consumed. Make sure to count fluids from canned fruit, canned vegetables, soups, and any other sources as well.

, Sodas should generally be avoided, as they're a source of unnecessary calories and sugar. However, if you like soda on occasion, go for light colored varieties. Lemon flavored sodas, like Sprite, are better than darker sodas like Coke and Pepsi.

Make sure that you avoid colas and soft drinks that contain phosphate or phosphoric acid. Sodas also have high amounts of sodium in them, and it is important to decrease your sodium/salt intake.

, Orange juice contains high levels of potassium. It's best to avoid orange juice if you have chronic kidney disease. Try substituting grape juice, apple juice, or cranberry juice for orange juice."

Perform 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise every other day on Body for Life.,
Consider cardiovascular exercise on the Atkins diet.,
Perform weight training on the days that you are not performing cardiovascular exercise on the Body for Life diet.,
Choose whether or not to perform strength training exercises on the Atkins diet.",How to Compare Body for Life to the Atkins Diet2," Your workout should consist of interval training following this pattern:


Warm up for 2 minutes at moderate intensity.
Slightly increase intensity for minutes 2 to 3.
Work you way to a high intensity level (you should be able to carry on a broken conversation) during minute 4. Keep the intensity high through minute 5 and bring it back to a moderate level during minute 6.
Repeat the pattern during minutes 7 to 11 and during minutes 12 to 16.
Accelerate during minute 17 to your highest level. Maintain that level of intensity for 1 full minute.
Use the last 2 minutes to bring yourself back to a moderate level and to cool down.

, Exercise is not recommended during Induction because of all of the physiological changes that are occurring in your body. However, when you reach OWL, you may add moderate cardio to your exercise routine.

, You should perform cardio and weight training 6 days per week on alternating days and rest on the 7th day. Your weight training should alternate between 1 day of upper-body work and 1 day of lower-body work.


Choose 2 exercises from each upper body category (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps) or 2 exercises from each lower body category (quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abs).
Perform 12 reps of the 1st exercise with a light weight. Rest 1 minute.
Add more weight and perform 10 repetitions. Rest 1 minute.
Add even more weight and perform 8 repetitions. Rest 1 minute.
Add the maximum amount of weight that you can tolerate and perform 6 reps. Rest 1 minute.
Go back to the original light weight and perform 12 reps. You will not rest after this set.
Immediately perform the second exercise for 12 reps with the light weight.
Rest for 2 minutes before going on to the next muscle group.

Drink plenty of water.,
Eat more fiber.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.,
Restrict your intake of simple carbohydrates.,
Eat more superfoods.,
Drink herbal teas.,
Eat organic produce.",How to Cleanse Your Body Naturally2," Increasing your water intake is one of the most important things you can do when attempting to cleanse your body naturally. You should aim to drink at least 8 glasses or 2 quarts of water throughout the day. You can increase your intake of water by drinking a glass first thing in the morning and with every snack or meal throughout the day. You can also eat fruit and veg with a high water content, such as watermelon, strawberries, cucumber and tomatoes.Water flushes toxins and impurities out of your system by helping both the kidneys and the bowel to maintain their normal functions - eliminating waste.Water also does a great job of keeping the skin looking healthy and young, preventing wrinkles and clearing the complexion.Water stored in copper vessels or bottles is purified and cleansed because of copper's anti-bacterial properties., Fiber is the number one nutrient for maintaining proper digestive function and, as such, is a fantastic natural cleanser. Eating more fiber helps the body to rid itself of the toxins, preservatives and other harmful waste materials that have built up in the digestive tract over time.Increasing your fiber intake helps to cleanse your body by stimulating regular bowel movements, leaving you feeling light and healthy, rather than bloated and sluggish.The best natural sources of fiber include whole-grain cereals, pasta and rice, fresh fruit and vegetables (especially with the skins left on), beans, lentils and almonds., Caffeine and alcohol are two substances that should be avoided as far as possible during the cleansing process. The toxins contained in both coffee and alcohol can impair liver and kidney function, which may prevent your body from being able to cleanse itself naturally. When your body is unable to cleanse itself, serious health conditions such as diabetes and obesity are a risk.Coffee is often exposed to herbicides and pesticides during the growing process, can contribute to dehydration and has no evident health benefits on the body. If you need a caffeine hit to get going in the morning, green tea is a much better choice, as it provides a small amount of caffeine in addition to healthy antioxidants.Alcohol, particularly dark liquors such as whisky, rum and red wine, contain toxins known as congeners which develop as a by-product of the fermentation process. In addition to these congeners, alcohol also produces a toxic substance known as acetaldehyde when it metabolizes in the body., Simple carbohydrates like white rice, bread and pasta are basically devoid of nutrients, vitamins or any substances that are good for your body. Yes, they will make you feel full initially, but this fullness is accompanied by a spike and then fall of your blood sugar, which is bad for your energy levels and overall health. In addition, simple carbohydrates are often filled with preservatives, which can build up in your system, leading to the development of toxins.To overcome this problem, switch to eating more high-fiber wholegrain foods and complex carbohydrates, such as those found in starchy vegetables like potatoes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, brown rice and legumes.Complex carbohydrates are much more beneficial for the digestive system and will help to clear out the build-up of preservatives and toxins left behind by simple carbohydrates., Although you should restrict your intake of any processed foods during a cleanse, you should try to eat as many superfoods as possible. These are certain foods that have extraordinary health benefits, which include helping your body by speeding up the cleansing process. Four of the most beneficial ones are listed below but others include blueberries, apples, watercress, celery, Brussels sprouts, carrots, papaya and wild rice.Garlic. Garlic has many significant health benefits, perhaps the most important of which is its ability to boost liver function by aiding in the production of enzymes which help the liver to clear toxins from the body. It also contains two substances known as allicin and selenium, which have also been found beneficial in cleansing the liver.Beets. Bright red beets are another superfood just bursting with health boosting goodness. They contain detoxifying, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, due to their high levels of betalain, the pigment which gives beets their vibrant color. Be aware that beets lose the best of their health benefits when cooked, so try to eat them raw as much as possible.Kale. Kale is a super-healthy leafy green vegetable with major cleansing credentials. Kale - along with other greens like cabbage - is a slightly alkaline food, which enables it to neutralize sugars and other toxins, before they are eliminated from the body. In this way, kale helps to ensure that blood maintains its natural, weakly alkaline state.Lemon. Lemons - along with other citrus fruits like grapefruit and lime - are widely accepted as being one of the best natural body cleansers available. This is why lemons are often a vital component in many juice cleanse and body flush recipes. The citric acid in lemons has the ability to dissolve built-up toxins in the body, allowing them to be flushed out through urination. Try squeezing some lemon juice into a glass of water and drinking first thing in the morning, or simply eat a grapefruit for breakfast., Drinking herbal teas is a great way to increase your fluid intake, while also reaping the benefits of the many naturally cleansing herbs and roots provided by Mother Nature. Some of the most beneficial teas you can drink include:



Dandelion tea: Dandelion tea cleanses the body by stimulating the gall bladder, kidneys and liver, thus decreasing water retention and helping your body to quickly flush out impurities. It is also thought to have a stabilizing effect on blood sugar and to help boost the immune system. Dandelion tea can be purchased in most health food stores, or you can make your own by boiling freshly harvested dandelions in water.Licorice tea. Licorice is a substance with extensive health benefits, but in terms of its uses as an internal cleanser, licorice tea helps to support liver function while also acting as a mild laxative, helping to clear the bowels by eliminating built-up waste. Licorice tea can be found in health food stores, or you can boil 1/2 oz of licorice root in a pint of water to make your own. Licorice tea may have a negative effect on people with high blood pressure, however, so you should consult your doctor before proceeding.Burdock tea. Burdock root has been used in natural remedies for centuries. Burdock is believed to be a natural blood purifier which helps to detoxify and cleanse the blood of any built-up impurities. It also may help to flush waste out of the system by cleansing the intestinal tract and stimulating the production of urine. In addition, it may help to protect and repair the liver, which can be useful following heavy consumption of alcohol. Burdock tea can be purchased or a small amount of the root can be boiled in water.

, Aim to buy only organically grown fruits and vegetables, and organically produced meat and dairy products. Although more expensive, organic produce is generally free of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers and uses a only a minimal amount of growth hormones and antibiotics.


By eating only organically produced foods, you are limiting your body's exposure to the harmful chemicals contained in such pesticides and other substances used in the production of non-organic foods.
Note that this will only limit your exposure to some toxins, but not others. There are still toxins in processed organic foods which may be harmful or carcinogenic.

Quit smoking.,
Get an intense massage.,
Try acupuncture.,
Avoid environmental toxins.,
Exercise.,
Get more sleep.,
Manage stress.,
Try fasting for a day or two.",How to Cleanse Your Body Naturally3," Smoking is one of the worst things you can do to introduce toxins into your body. Aside from nicotine, most commercial cigarette brands contain over 4000 other toxic chemicals. Even after you quit smoking, these toxins will linger in your body for some time. For this reason - smoking should be the first thing to go when trying to cleanse your body naturally.


Although your body will eventually flush out these toxins on its own, you can expedite the process by drinking plenty of water, eating healthy, fiber-rich foods and getting plenty of exercise.

, Here's one suggestion that should be welcome news! A good, intense massage can actually help to rid the body of excess toxins, when performed by a trained professional. The massage needs to focus on pressure points within the muscles, where toxins have a tendency to accumulate. The deep stimulation of this muscle tissue can actually release the toxins, allowing them to be flushed naturally from the system.Make sure you see a registered massage therapist who has experience with toxin-releasing massage techniques.
Remember to drink plenty of water after your massage session to speed up the flushing-out process.

, Acupuncture is a form of holistic treatment which works by inserting tiny needs into the skin at pressure points around the body. Acupuncture can help to cleanse the body by targeting pressure points where toxins tend to build up. The toxins are then released, so that they can be naturally flushed out of your system.Though it may not sound like it, acupuncture can be a very relaxing experience and many people have found it to be an extremely effective treatment for ailments as diverse as sinus blockages and fertility problems.Make sure you see a licensed acupuncturist for treatment, as it can be dangerous when practiced incorrectly.

, This one can be tricky, especially in modern times when air pollution and overuse of chemicals is so pervasive in Western society. Whenever possible you should try to surround yourself with clean fresh air and avoid breathing in city smog and factory smoke. Escape to the country or seaside for the weekend, if you can, to clear the city from your lungs.Also avoid breathing in second-hand smoke as far as possible, and try to use natural cleaning products to clean your home, to avoid unnecessary exposure to harsh chemicals.
Get outdoors and go for a walk in the park or along the lake. It helps you stay fit and enhances the functioning of your body and mind.

, Getting regular exercise is one of the healthiest, most natural ways to cleanse the body. This is because exercise gets the body moving and keeps it functioning at full capacity. It helps you to lose weight, thus releasing the toxins that have built up in fat cells over the years. Toxins are also expelled from the body through perspiration, cleansing the body in the most natural way possible.Exercise also improves both circulation and digestion, two bodily functions which are essential in the process of natural cleansing.Try to incorporate four or five 30-minutes sessions of moderate to intense exercise into your weekly routine - anything from running, swimming, dancing or climbing - you'll feel healthier and happier in no time., Although it's not responsible for cleansing the body in itself, sleep is nonetheless essential for maintaining normal body function and for living a healthy life. Your body needs sleep to recover and repair itself after the stresses and strains of daily life.


Getting 7-8 hours sleep a night - as doctors recommend - helps your body prepare for the next day, giving you more energy for exercise and other healthy lifestyle choices.
Sleep also essential for a healthy immune system, without which your body would be unable to deal with the harmful viruses, bacteria and toxins it is constantly bombarded with.People who are sleep deprived are at higher risk of developing heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity., Stress can contribute to your overall ill health, as it impairs the release of good hormones and prevents your body from functioning at its optimal level. Without these good hormones, your body retains toxins which may cause you to feel tired and depressed, leading to further weight gain and unhealthy lifestyle choices. By successfully keeping your stress levels to a minimum, you can encourage the release of good hormones and minimize your body's retention of negative toxins, leading to a happier, healthier you.Yoga and meditation are great choices for people with busy lives who are trying to reduce their stress levels. By focusing only on your breathing, you are clearing and cleansing the mind which, in turn, has a positive impact on the body.

, Fasting is a popular, if a little extreme, way of cleansing the body by cutting out or severely limiting your body's intake of food, while simultaneously flushing out your system with high volumes of liquid. The idea is that your body can start afresh - cleansed and renewed - after everything bad has been expelled from the system.Some extreme fasters will go for over a week (or even two) without eating, but if you have never fasted before you should probably try it for just one or two days, to minimize the shock to your system.Although some fasting advocates hold that only water should be drunk over the course of the fast, others believe that juice is the way to go as the natural sugars help to wash out the system more quickly.You should be aware that the jury is still out on whether fasting has any significant impact on cleansing your system, and many doctors believe that such an extreme course of action may have more negative side effects than positive."

Get in regular servings of calcium-rich foods.,
Finish meals with crunchy, high fiber foods.,
Choose lean protein sources.,
Chew sugar-free gum.,
Drink adequate amounts of water.,
Avoid sucking on hard candies.,
Minimize sugary beverages.,
Do not chew on ice.,
Watch out for coffee and tea.,
Be mindful of sticky foods.,
Visit your dentist.,
Brush your teeth regularly.,
Floss on a daily basis.,
Use mouthwash if directed.",How to Choose Foods for Healthy Teeth," Even though teeth are not considered bones, they are still made up primarily of calcium deposits.Calcium is essential to the maintenance of healthy teeth and gums.


Calcium not only plays a role in the maintenance of healthy teeth, but also in the maintenance of the jaw bones which hold the teeth in place preventing loose teeth, fractures or even periodontitis.
Calcium is most commonly found in dairy foods - like cheese or milk. Including the recommended two to three servings of dairy each day can help ensure you're eating adequate amounts of calcium. Calcium is a positive ion, so it helps to create an alkaline pH, which is ideal for your teeth.
Aim for about 8 oz of milk, yogurt or cottage cheese and about 1 or 2 oz of hard cheese per serving.;
, You may already know that eating fruits and vegetables is an essential part to a healthy, well-balanced diet. However, these fibrous, crunchy foods are also great for the maintenance and health of your teeth.There are a couple of reasons why fruits and vegetables are great for your teeth. First off, they require extra chewing (from all that fiber). Chewing stimulates your saliva glands and helps clean your teeth and wash away particles of foods. Chewing also stimulates the periodontal fibers that hold your teeth in the jaw, making them stronger and reducing their mobility.
These foods also scrape up against your teeth - in a good way. It can help clean off bits of food from your meals.
Dentists recommend eating fruits and vegetables last to help scrub your teeth and produce extra saliva.
Finish meals with a crunchy fruit or vegetable like: apples, celery, carrots, raw peppers, a small salad or raw cucumber slices.

, Protein-based foods, like chicken, steak or pork are another important grouping of foods that will help support the health of your teeth. They contain phosphorus and protein which are essential for healthy teeth.Phosphorus is a mineral that works in conjunction with calcium. Together they help build a strong network for your teeth and prevent the formation of a weak bone structure, which may be caused by osteoporosis. If the bone structure is too weak, then an oral surgeon would not be able to place a dental implant if one was needed.
In addition, these foods help maintain the protein structure of your teeth and support the enamel of your teeth.
Include a serving of lean protein at each meal. Measure out 3 to 4 oz per serving. Go for phosphorus-rich protein sources like: beans, chicken, turkey, eggs, beef and dairy foods.

, Although many candies are something your dentist advises to stay away from, sugar-free gum might be something you want to chew on. Pop in a piece of sugar-free gum after meals to help support healthy teeth.Like crunchy, fibrous fruits and vegetables, chewing gum also helps stimulate saliva glands in your mouth. This helps wash away food particles and acid that can wear down your teeth.
In addition, many types of sugar-free gum are sweetened with a sugar alcohol known as xylitol. This artificial sweetener naturally kills and reduces the amount of bacteria in your mouth. It is best to chew a sugar-free gum after meals and then brush your teeth because the acids that were formed while you were eating have already been neutralized by the chewing effect, so the risk of toothbrush erosion is lowered.
Try to choose mint or peppermint gum over cinnamon or fruity flavors. Sometimes these fruity flavored gums are higher in acid which can damage your teeth.

, Water is essential to an overall healthy diet. It helps keep you hydrated but also helps maintain proper oral health.Water, especially fluoridated water, helps make teeth more resistant to the acid that can cause cavities and other damage.
Aim for at least 64 oz of tap water each day. You can mix tap water with water flavorings or make decaf coffee or tea with it.
If you use purified water or do not have a source of fluoridated water, you may want to consider taking a fluoride supplement if there is a high risk of tooth decay.

, If there is one thing that a dentist would tell you to limit to help protect your teeth, it'd be hard candies. Although tasty, these types of candies can wreak havoc on your teeth.


The biggest problem with hard candies is that your teeth are exposed directly to sugar for an extended period of time. In addition, most people usually tuck away a hard candy on the side of their mouth and allow it to dissolve right on their teeth.Hard candies are also...hard. If you were to chomp down on one or try to chew it, you might end up with a chipped or broken tooth.
If you like hard candies, go for sugar-free candies - especially those that are made with xylitol.

, Like hard candies, also limit sugary, sweetened beverages. The sugar and acidity of these drinks can seriously damage your teeth.Sodas, even diet sodas contain an acid that wears down tooth enamel. In addition, regular sodas are high in sugar.
Also watch your fruit juice consumption. Even 100% juice, especially citrus juice, can be harmful if you consume it frequently. They're highly acidic and can wear down the enamel on your teeth. Otherwise, it can bring a lot of benefits, such as preventing bacteria or creating an alkaline pH.
If you're craving a sweet beverage, ask for a straw. This limits your teeth's exposure to the sugar and other chemicals that could weak your teeth.

, You might not think that ice is a food per se, but many people chew on it. This is very dangerous to your teeth and should be avoided at all costs.Ice is very hard and dense. Chewing it or trying to break it with your teeth can cause your teeth to chip or break.
In addition, if your teeth break the ice into sharp pieces or shards, you can cut your gums or cheek.
If you currently chew on ice, stop immediately. It's OK to suck on it, but do not break it up with your teeth or you could cause fractures that can be hard to repair, or even enamel cracks that will lead to sensitive teeth.

, While coffee and tea do have some health benefits, they can actually be bad for your teeth. Be careful with what you add to these drinks and how often you consume them.


Both coffee and tea are somewhat bitter. Many people will add sugar to these beverages to sweeten them up. This exposes your teeth to sugar which could cause cavities.Caffeinated coffee and tea can dry out your mouth - especially when consumed in larger quantities or combined with smoking cigarettes. The lack of saliva can promote bacteria growth in your mouth and on your teeth.
Both coffee and tea can also stain your teeth. Although this isn't harmful to your teeth, it can cause a significant color change on your teeth.

, One small group of foods that many dentists suggest minimizing are sticky foods. Whether its dried fruit or a soft caramel, the sugary bits of these foods can get stuck on your teeth.Sticky foods to watch out for include: taffy, caramels, gummy candies, gummy vitamins, dried fruit or licorice.
These foods can get stuck on and in-between your teeth promoting plaque buildup.
If you do eat these foods, make sure to brush and floss your teeth afterwards to help remove any leftover sugary bits.

, The most important health professional when it comes to your teeth is your dentist. If you are worried about the health of your teeth and mouth, make sure to visit your dentist.


Most dentists will recommend that you get a general check-up and cleaning about 2 times a year or every 6 months. However, if you are more prone to getting cavities or have other oral health problems, you may need to go more often.Talk to your dentist about your diet. Ask if there are any foods they specifically recommend staying away from or if they are noticing any damage to your teeth.
Also ask about how to brush and floss properly. This is another important component to good oral health because an incorrect brushing technique can do a lot more harm than not brushing at all.

, In addition to choosing foods that support dental health and avoiding those that can damage teeth, it's important to brush your teeth. This is essential to maintaining proper oral health.Dentists recommend brushing your teeth at least two times a day. You should use a toothbrush that is the appropriate size allowing you to easily reach all areas of your mouth.
You also need to replace your toothbrush or toothbrush head every three to four months. Otherwise, the bristles get overly soft and are not as effective and the tip may also become sharp and hurt the gums.
Make sure to brush the inner and outer surface of your teeth. In addition brush your tongue, especially the back of your tongue, to remove bacteria that can cause bad breath.

, Along with brushing, make sure to floss your teeth regularly as well. Flossing helps clean teeth a little bit differently compared to brushing. Together these two methods of cleaning your teeth can keep them healthy and strong.


Most dentist recommend flossing at least one or two times a day. You can floss before or after brushing your teeth.Flossing is something you need to do in addition to brushing because floss will reach plaque that your tooth brush can't. The plaque, if left on your teeth, can cause calculus and tartar.

, Mouthwash isn't something that's necessary for everyone. However, if your dentist recommends using mouthwash, it's a good idea to begin using it regularly. It can help support the health of your mouth and teeth just like flossing and brushing by preventing the gums to swell or bleed from brushing.


If you do decide to use mouthwash, make sure to purchase a use a product that contains fluoride.In addition, do not rinse your mouth with mouthwash immediately after you brush your teeth. The fluoride from your toothpaste is a much more concentrated source of fluoride and should be allowed to stay on your teeth and not be washed away by mouth wash.
Instead, use mouthwash periodically throughout the day - like after lunch or an afternoon snack.
After using mouthwash, do not eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes.

Over the counter eye drops are administered about four to six times daily or as needed.

, Give your eyes a break and some much-needed by avoiding sources of large amounts of light. You can do this either by sitting in a dark room or by covering your eyes with an eye mask that some use to help sleep. Even an hour or two of darkness will greatly decrease the pain from overexposure to light.If your lifestyle allows it, try to avoid using computer screens or televisions for at least a day. Eye strain from consistently working on a computer, or watching TV can cause dryness and itchiness in the eyes. Most people will feel strain after three to four hours of sustained screen time. See Method 2 for more proactive tips.

, Cold compresses can be an effective way to get fast relief from eye pain. because it can help to constrict the blood vessels in your eye, which make your eye feel less inflamed.

Eat protein.,
Make a protein shake.,
Replenish lost electrolytes.,
Avoid junk food.,
Eat fruits and vegetables.,
Drink more water.",How to Choose Healthy Post Exercise Foods," After a workout, your body's energy resources are depleted and needs replenishing. Protein, also called amino acids, (the building blocks for proteins) is a good choice. Fatty, sugary, and oily foods should be avoided. You also need to refuel with some healthy carbs, such as whole wheat bread or fruits, in order to refuel your glycogen supply;
, One invariably feels hungry - it's the body's way of asking for replenishment. The best way would be to carry a protein shake and sip on it post workout. This works in two ways: it starts the restoration process with just what the body needs without negating the effect of the workout, and it satiates your hunger so you don't indulge yourself and feast on junk food.

, Vitamin waters, Gatorade, and other sports drinks can restore nutrients lost while perspiring. Coconut water is another great electrolyte beverage, it naturally has the minerals needed to better absorb water and can also be found in delicious flavors like guava. Plain ol' water works too.

, The best way to avoid eating junk food after exercising, or at any time, is to simply not buy any. Of course this is harder if you have kids, because they tend to love junk food. However, you can buy low-calorie versions of foods that you like. Try to buy Fudgesicles, Skinny Cow ice cream, etc. If you love chips/cookies, or other junk food, you can indulge, just in moderation.

Observe for eyestrain.,
Know whether you have an infection.,
Determine whether you have allergies.,
Confirm the diagnosis with a physician.",How to Make Your Eyes Stop Hurting2," Think of how much time you spend staring at a screen everyday. Eye strain from consistently working on a computer, or watching T.V. can cause dryness and itchiness in the eyes. Often eye strain is due to decreased blinking, focusing on a screen that is too close (less than 20 inches away) or not wearing prescribed lenses when they are in fact needed. Eyestrain is on the rise due to the proliferation of screens, including televisions and computers but also more recently, smartphones.


Symptoms included a itchy and dry eyes, pain, a sensation of a foreign object being in the eyes, and the feeling of tired eyes.
You can take both treatment and preventive measures to deal with eyestrain. Refer here for more treatment information.

, It's possible that your eye pain is due to an infection, such as conjunctivitis, known more commonly as pink eye. If the eye looks pink and slightly cloudy, it is possible that you have contracted pink eye. Symptoms range from eye discharge (pus or increase in tears), pain with light, and fever depending on the agent. Pink eye is a common, yet troublesome disease that can either be treated at home or with antibiotics from a doctor depending on the severity and type of infection. Click here for more detailed information.


Another possible infection is a stye, which is an infection of the eyelid caused by bacteria from eye makeup or contact lenses blocking the glands of the eyelid. Symptoms are pain with blinking, pain with light, red eyes along with eye pain. Typically, hot compresses for 20 minutes four to six times daily can remove the blockage

, One of the most common conditions causing eye pain and irritation is allergies. If you have allergies, your body treats a normally harmless substance as a threat and responds by releasing excess histamine. This will cause your skin to itch, your throat to swell, and your eyes to become itchy and watery. If you have these symptoms, click here.


Itchy eyes are usually not the only symptom of allergies. If your eye pain is accompanied by itchiness in other parts of your body, sneezing or a runny nose, you likely have allergies.

Take breaks from screens.,
Blink more.,
Consider lighting and contrast.,
Adjust fonts and contrast settings on documents.,
Consider the position of the screen.,
Use artificial tear drops.,
Think about purchasing computer eyewear.",How to Make Your Eyes Stop Hurting3," Avoid working on your computer or watching television for a little while. Instead of watching T.V., try reading a book instead. Force your eyes to focus on something that's not a screen. If you must work with computers for your work, be sure to take plenty of breaks throughout the day.Try the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take your eyes off the computer screen and look at something that is 20 feet (6.1 m) away for twenty seconds. If you're working, do other work during this time, such as making a phone call or filing something.
If you can, try to get up and move around for a bit. Lean back and close your eyes for a few minutes.

, Blinking produces tears that refresh and rehydrate your eyes. Most people do not blink frequently enough when working at a computer, which can cause dry eyes. Because many people blink less than normal when working at a computer, dry eyes can result from prolonged computer use.Try to make a concerted effort to be more aware of how much you blink and to do it more often.

, Lower the brightness on your screen. The default setting for many computers is much higher than it needs to be and can cause unnecessary strain. Use a low setting in dark rooms and a higher setting in bright rooms. This way, the intensity of light entering your eye will be consistent. Check the glare on your computer screen as well. Too much glare can cause eye strain because it causes your eyes to have to work harder to see things on the computer. To check this, turn the screen off. This will help you see the reflected light and notice the extent of the glare.When watching TV, keep the room softly lit by using one or two lamps is better for your eyes than having a big contrast between a bright TV screen and darker surrounding environment.
Do not look at your phone or work on your computer before bed. The bright screens in contrast with the dark room will cause a large amount of strain on your eyes. This will dry them out further as well as make it hard for you to fall asleep.

, Change the font size setting or zoom in to read documents on the computer. Reading words which are too small will force you to strain your eyes to focus. Find a font size that doesn't force you to move your eyes closer to the screen.Notice as well the contrast setting on your documents and make needed adjustments. Black print on a white background is the most comforting contrast to read documents in. If you spend much of your day reading documents with unusual color contrasts, try to change to black and white.

, Be sure to sit far enough away from the screen. Position your computer 20 to 24 inches (50.8 to 61.0 cm) away with the center of the screen 10 to 15 degrees below your eyes. Sit up straight and try to keep this posture through the day.If you wear bifocals, you may have a tendency to tilt your head backwards so you can see through the lower part of your glasses. To adjust for this, you could buy new glasses just for computer work or try lowering your monitor so you don't have to tilt your head back.

, Artificial tears, which are available over-the-counter at any drugstore or pharmacy, can help relieve the dry eyes that result from too much screen time. Try to find a lubricating drop that has no preservatives; you can use this as often as you like. If you use a drop with preservative, use to a maximum of four times each day. If you're unsure of which artificial tear drops are best for you and your eyes, consult your doctor., There are many eyewear products products which can help those who must look at screens all day avoid eye strain. Many of these change the color of the screen to be more comforting on your eyes. Most lenses in glasses and contacts are designed for reading print and not for screens, so getting something suited for computer work may be a good option for you.This step, however, should be a last resort. The best way to avoid eyestrain is of course to avoid screens. If you absolutely must consistently work with screens, consider purchasing eyewear designed specifically for computer work.
Be sure that your contact or eyeglass prescriptions are correct and up to date. Incorrect prescriptions can lead to more work by your eyes, increasing the incidence of eyestrain. Speak with your eye care professional if you are having difficulty with your vision."

Symptoms include redness or swelling of the eye, blurred vision, eye pain, gritty feeling in the eyes, increased tearing, itching of the eye, photophobia or sensitivity to light.Viral pink eye results from a viral infection, such as influenza, and unfortunately has no quick cure. Most people who develop this type of pink eye would have already been suffering from a flu or cold. The best option in treating this form of pink eye is to simply use general home treatments to ease some of the pain. This type of pink eye will generally clear on its own in two to three days but last up to two weeks.
Bacterial pink eye is generally caused by the same bacteria that is responsible for strep throat and is the most common type of pink eye. This bacteria lives on the surface of the skin and causes infections due to unhygienic practices such as frequent eye rubbing, improper hand washing or unsanitary contact lens use. This type of pink eye is distinguished by thick, yellow discharge from the eye and can result in rapid vision loss if not treated in a timely manner with antibiotics.

Some examples of antibiotic eyedrops include Bacitracin (AK-Tracin), Chloramphenicol (Chloroptic), Ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan), and others. Always complete the full duration of antibiotic treatment, even though symptoms should subside with in three to five days.If the infection is due to chlamydia, then the doctor will prescribe Azithromycin, Erythromycin or Doxycycline. If the infection is due to gonorrhea, then a Ceftriaxone Intramuscular injection will be completed along with Azithromycin orally.
Viral conjunctivitis usually goes away on its own after two to three days and does not need antibiotics or other prescription medication.Treat allergic conjunctivitis with allergy medications, such as antihistamines (like over-the-counter Benadryl). In addition, most eye drops contain a compound known as tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, which works as a vasoconstrictor and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels and makes them less noticeable. In some cases, allergic reactions may go away on their own if you avoid contact with the allergen., Flush the affected eye with cool water regularly in order to stop the infection from becoming worse. Use either a warm cloth or towel to gently rub the area around the eye.

, Stop the spread of pink eye regularly washing your hands and by avoiding touching your eye. Pink eye is an extremely contagious disease and can be spread easily through hand-to-hand contact. By washing your hands and not touching your eyes, you will lessen the chance that those you come in contact with will contract pink eye.


Additionally, let people know that they should be sure to avoid touching their eyes after contact with you.

, Call a doctor if the pink eye worsens or is causing you considerable pain. In addition to more accurately diagnosing the type of pink eye, the doctor can prescribe antibiotics and other prescription treatment that are not available over-the-counter.


Be sure to follow the doctor's instructions regarding type, dosage and frequency of medication in order to maximize the medication's benefits and effectively treat pink eye.

Prime your eyes.,
Apply a light color over your lid.,
Highlight the inner corner and brow bone.,
Brush your medium color into your crease.,
Add the darkest color to outer edge.,
Clean up the bottom of your eye with concealer and powder.",How to Make Your Eyes Look Less Droopy1," Before you apply any product to your eyes, you want to put on a great primer. Makeup primer basically acts as a foundation for makeup, giving it a smooth base to stick to. It will help make sure your eyeshadow lasts all day. Plus, it will prevent smudging, which can make droopy eyes look even droopier., Just like with many makeup looks, you will want to choose three shadow colors in light, medium, and dark shades. You will apply the lightest over your entire lid as your base color. Begin in the middle, carefully blending it out across your entire lid and up to the crease. From the crease, sweep the product up to your brow bone, not adding more product, but simply blending it upwards., This might sound tricky, but it’s not. If you have fair skin, grab a pink or rose gold color. If you have medium skin, use a white or white gold shimmer. For darker skin, try a bronze shadow. Simply place a bit of your highlight color in the inner corner of your eye and along your brow bone. Then, brush the remaining product on the center of your lid. These highlights will make your eyes look bright and open, and therefore less droopy! , Use a fluffy brush to sweep the product along your eyelid crease, but do not extend it past the outer corner of your eye. Imagine a line connecting your bottom last line to the tail of your eyebrow. Don’t put dark shadow past that line. Instead, when you get to the end of your crease, gently sweep the product upwards. It shouldn’t be dark or highly pigmented, but it can add a bit of lift to your eye., Again, imagine a line extending upwards from your lower lash line. If you need to, hold a straight edge or an eyeliner pencil against the bottom of your eye so that it extends up from the outer corner towards your eyebrow. The darkest color should not go past this line. Instead, brush the color into just the corner of your lid and sweep it upwards. By brushing the color upwards, rather than outwards, it will lift your eye up., Use a concealer brush to carefully brush concealer under your eye. Then, bring it upwards so that it follows the upward line you created with your eyeshadow. Use the concealer to make the border of the eyeshadow darker and crisper. Then, simply dust your lightest eyeshadow over the concealer."

Check whether LASIK can correct your vision.,
Ask whether LASIK is appropriate for your life situation.,
Read about the risks of LASIK carefully.,
Consider the alternatives.,
Determine whether you can afford LASIK.",How to Know if Lasik Eye Surgery Is for You1," The procedure can correct nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. Successful surgery can eliminate the need to wear contact lenses or glasses in patients with mild to moderate nearsightedness or astigmatism.


LASIK does not help people who need reading glasses or who have high levels of nearsightedness. Your eye care professional can diagnose your refractive error during a routine exam or you can check your glasses prescription.Ask if your eyes are within the range of error that LASIK effectively treats.;
, Since the procedure is elective, you should consider whether you will be able to enjoy the benefits of the surgery fully. People under 18 years old cannot get the procedure, and it is typically advised that you wait until adulthood when your eyesight stabilizes. Discuss your situation with your eye care provider.


Women who plan to get pregnant, are pregnant, or are nursing should wait for LASIK.
You should not receive LASIK if you will be playing contact sports during the recovery period.
Many government and health care informational sites will list the issues that may make you a poor candidate for the procedure including age, health issues, and professional reasons., The procedure is common and the complication rate is considered low. Nevertheless, there are risks. As you determine whether the surgery is right for you, consider these possible complications.Under corrections. If not enough tissue is removed, you will not get clear vision as a result of the surgery.
Overcorrections. It's also possible that the laser will remove too much tissue from your eye. Over corrections may be more difficult to fix than under corrections.
Loss of vision. In some cases, surgical complications can cause a loss of vision.
Astigmatism. Because LASIK surgery changes the shape of the cornea, new astigmatism can result from the surgery.

, LASIK is a commonly advertised surgery that is convenient for many patients. Be aware that there are alternative eye correction surgeries, too. Many of these procedures are suitable for different eye problems. Some of these alternatives are less invasive than LASIK eye surgery.


Some options, like PRK and LASEK, are alternative laser surgeries that may be suitable for some patients that do not qualify for LASIK.
Visian™ Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) and Verisyse™ Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) offer alternatives to cornea reshaping., Most insurance plans do not cover elective surgery. In most cases, LASIK eye surgery will be considered an elective procedure. Check with your insurer, but anticipate that you will need to pay for the procedure on your own. Though prices vary due to several factors, you can expect to pay between $1,000 and $3,000 USD per eye."

Find a pencil, and mark it somewhere in the middle.,
Hold the pencil in front of your face, at arm's length.,
Focus your eyes on the mark you drew on the pencil.,
Slowly move the pencil toward your face, maintaining your focus on the same spot.,
Stop when you see two pencils.,
Look away for a few seconds, or close your eyes.,
Look back at the pencil.,
Slowly move the pencil away from your face.,
Repeat the exercise.",How to Improve Your Vision Naturally1," Draw a letter, number or dot on the side of the pencil. For this exercise, you'll focus on the pencil and the dot as you move it toward and away from your eyes. Pencil push-ups are reputed to correct double vision and crossed eyes, but it can't hurt to try them for other issues — it's free, painless, and only involves focusing and refocusing your eyes.;
, Keep the pencil vertical, so that the eraser is pointing toward either the ceiling or the floor. If you're having someone else help you with the exercise and hold the pencil for you, hold out your arm to determine how far away it should be.

, Don't proceed to the next step until you feel like your eyes are solidly focused.

, Try to move it in a straight line, toward your nose.


As the pencil comes closer, your eyes will have to adjust to maintain the same level of focus.

, As soon as the pencil doubles, stop moving it closer to your face.

, Without moving your head or the pencil, shift your focus away from the pencil for a moment. Focus on something else in your visual field, and don't worry about looking at the pencil at all for at least 5 seconds. If you're having a hard time, close your eyes for a moment.

, Once your eyes are refreshed, try to focus on the pencil so that you aren't seeing double.


If you're still seeing two pencils, rest your eyes for a few more seconds and try again. Don't get discouraged if you still see two pencils after your second try — you'll get better! Just move on to the next step.

, Keep your focus on the mark you drew on the pencil as it moves back. Keep going until it's at arm's length again.

, Pencil push-ups work best when you do them repeatedly, as part of a daily routine. Set aside five minutes a day at first, then try ramping up to 10.


If you struggle to keep track of the time or stay entertained, try listening to music while you practice. For instance, two songs equal roughly five minutes, and three songs are roughly 10.

Avoid contact with the allergen.,
Use a hypertonic sodium chloride solution.,
Try an ophthalmic lubricant.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Make Your Eyes Stop Hurting5," If your eye pain is coming from allergies, your best bet is to remove the allergens or remove yourself from environments in which the allergens are present.


If you do not know what this allergen is, consult a doctor. They will be able to conduct a skin test which will accurately tell them what your body is allergic to.
Seasonal allergies are common and usually are at their worst during springtime when many plants bloom and release pollen. Look up the pollen count for your area online and stay inside as much as possible on days when the pollen count is high. Avoid mowing the lawn or other yard chores that stir up more pollen.Cat and dog allergies are another common allergen. Direct contact with cats or dogs will affect people with these allergies and can continue to affect them days after initial contact.
Food allergies are less common but can cause severe swelling and itchiness of the eyes. Food allergies tend to be more severe so this will also be accompanied by an upset stomach or itchiness of the skin or throat.

, This can help to bring down swelling and pain in the eye. Hypertonic sodium chloride is available over-the-counter and comes in the form of ophthalmic solutions or ointment and it is a good alternative to ophthalmic decongestants. This medication can help to decrease pain, and can also absorb excess fluid in your eye because it contains a high level of salt. Good options include:Muro 128 5% ophthalmic solution: Apply one to two drops to the affected eye every four hours, but do not use it for more than 72 hours in a row.

Muro 128 5% ointment: To use this ointment, pull down the lower lid of the affected eye and apply a small ribbon of the ointment to the inside of the eyelid, once daily or as directed by physician.

, Ophthalmic lubricants are most used for corneal ulcerations that occur because your body does not produce enough tear fluid. These lubricants help to moisten and refresh the eye. Most of these lubricants are OTC medications, including Visine Tears Dry Eye Relief, Visine Tears Long Lasting Dry Eye Relief, Tears Naturale Forte, and Tears Plus.Consult the instructions on the packaging of any ophthalmic lubricant before use. Follow the appropriate amount and frequency of dosing.
If you can avoid choosing a lubricant with preservatives as some people are sensitive to these preservatives and experience increased redness, burning or itching., Your doctor will be able to pinpoint the cause of the allergic reaction and can prescribe more powerful medicine to help lessen your symptoms.


If your doctor discovers signs of allergies, he will likely refer you to an allergist. Allergists specialize in treating patients suffering from allergies.

Choose your eyeliner.,
Begin applying your liner in the center of your lid.,
Create a wing.,
Connect your wing to your lower lash line.",How to Make Your Eyes Look Less Droopy2," For this technique, your best options are gel, felt tip, or liquid liners. You will be creating a winged eyeliner look, and these three products work best to create precise lines.Choose the product that you feel most comfortable working with. You may need a bit of practice, but that’s okay!

, Carefully begin lining your top waterline at the center of your lid, brushing it towards your outer corner in small strokes. The line should get thicker as it moves toward your outer corner. Once you’ve outlined from the middle to the outer corner, bring it inwards towards your inner corner. As you bring the eyeliner inwards, thin out the line.

, To do this, follow the same angle you created with your shadows. From the outer corner of your eye, create a line in eyeliner extending upwards. Bring it to a point, which is the tip of your eyeliner “wing.” From that tip, bring another line inwards, connecting to your top eyeliner.For winged eyeliner instructions and demonstrations, check out the article here.

, You do not want to fully line your bottom lash line. However, you can line the very outer corner to attach it to the outer wing and make your makeup look more cohesive. Make sure only the outer 1/4 of your bottom lash line is lined."

, You will need to be able to discuss your needs and concerns with your doctor in clear and accurate terms. Read the information about LASIK or related eye surgery that is provided by reliable sources such as the Mayo Clinic or research institutes.


Avoid using any sites that are actively advertising for LASIK eye surgery when you conduct your research. Since they are advertising the procedure, they are not neutral sites.

, You will need to have a doctor examine your eyes to confirm that you are a good candidate for the procedure. A regular eye care provider will be able to give advice for your particular needs, and she may be able to recommend an experienced surgeon to perform the procedure.

, Check that your surgeon is certified. Before committing to the procedure, also ask the doctor who will perform the surgery questions that establish their knowledge of the procedure: how many LASIK surgeries have you performed? is my refractive error within the advised range? am I in the best life-stage to get this procedure?


Beware if a doctor provides vague figures about how many procedures have been performed at a medical center. Make sure your doctor tells you the number of LASIK surgeries they have performed personally.

"
Follow the surgery preparation instructions.,
Arrange transportation.,
Anticipate limited visibility.,

, You will experience some blurry vision and/or vision fluctuations after LASIK eye surgery. Most patients report improved vision within a day of the procedure, but it may take longer. It can take two or three months for your vision to fully stabilize after surgery, though most patients can resume driving and return to work within a few days.Before you schedule the procedure, you should make sure that this recovery period will not interfere with other aspects of your life.


At the end of the procedure, a shield or protective wrap will be placed over your eye. This eye protection will keep the corneal cut from being disturbed during the healing process. Anticipate wearing this for the remainder of the day after your surgery, and possibly at night.

, You will need to visit your doctor for a post-surgical check-up within 24-48 hours of the surgery. You may want to plan a few days off from work following the initial surgery. Healing from LASIK usually happens rapidly and you should notice improved vision with a few days of the surgery.


The doctor will monitor your progress periodically for six months after surgery. Complications can develop after the procedure and vision can worsen gradually over time, so most doctors will follow a patient’s progress for one year.

, Like any other muscle, the muscles around your eyes can start to feel fatigued and painful if you strain them too much. Try these tricks to cut back on visual fatigue:


Practice the ""20-20-20"" trick. If your work involves staring at a screen for long periods of time, take a break every 20 minutes, and focus on a point 20 feet (6.1 m) away for at least 20 seconds.
Turn down brightness. If you're looking at a computer or television screen, turn down the brightness to the lowest possible level. You should still be able to see, but you shouldn't feel like you're staring at a bright light.
Make text bigger. If you're reading on a computer, use your program's zoom function to make the text larger. Or, if reading small print in books is a problem, invest in a reading magnifying glass or buy larger-print editions.
Do not forget to blink. We tend to blink very less while using computers/laptops. That induces dryness on the surface of the eye which sometimes causes irritation and burning sensation. The normal blink rate is around 12-15 times/minutes. We should try to maintain that while working on the laptops.

, The high-energy visible (HEV) light, often called “blue light” emitted by digital screens is the main culprit in damaging eye tissue.Ensure computer monitors are about an arm’s length away (between 20-26 inches).Tablets and smartphones should be held at least 16 inches away. To aid in reading small font, increase the text size on the screen rather than holding it closer to your face., Experts recommend that all adults at least get a comprehensive dilated eye exam by the age of 40, and follow up with regular visits thereafter.

Check to see if you have vision insurance or a health policy that covers eye care.Regular health insurance typically covers screenings for those with an increased risk factor for eye disease. If you don’t have insurance coverage, find out the eye doctor’s fee for a routine exam, and for any special testing that may be required.
See the right kind of eye care professional at the right time. Ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians all deal with eye care and treatment but have different training and expertise..
You can request a referral for an ophthalmologist or optometrist from your family physician, or call a local hospital or medical center’s department of ophthalmology or optometry for information., Most commonly, eye drops are placed in the eye in order to dilate the pupil. The patient’s eyes are then evaluated for vision acuity, coordination of eye muscles, peripheral vision, response to light, color testing, eyelid health and function, the health of the interior and back of the eye, and pressure., Beginning at the age of six months, infants should have their first eye examination. Vision and eye development problems in children are best treated if they are caught early.

, Some conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, HIV or AIDS, or thyroid diseases can cause or worsen eye conditions. Additionally, you should also contact your physician right away if you have pain in the eye, unusual red eye, or any of the following issues:Bulging or misalignment of one or both eyes
Dark curtain or veil that blocks your vision
Distorted, doubled, or decreased vision, even if temporary
Excess tearing
Halos (colored circles around lights)
Loss of peripheral (side) vision
New floaters (black ""strings"" or specks in the vision) and/or flashes of light

, Common eye problems and diseases include glaucoma, cataracts, conjunctivitis, retinal disorders, and macular degeneration. These diseases do not always have symptoms, so if you have a sudden change in vision, it is important to contact your health care professional right away.Cataracts — A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye, and are common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either suffer from cataracts or have had cataract surgery. Common symptoms include blurry vision and seeing halos.Glaucoma — Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, with the main feature being damage to the optic nerve. Symptoms include slowly losing peripheral vision. There is no cure, but symptoms can be controlled through medication and surgery to lower the eye pressure.Macular degeneration — More common even than glaucoma, macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss, affecting more than 10 million Americans.It consists of the deterioration of the eye’s macula, which is the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye that controls a person’s central vision.

, Your physician will want to know if you have experienced certain conditions or problems before, or have had family members experience them. Diagnoses of nearsightedness and farsightedness have a genetic component.Additionally, diseases like glaucoma and macular degeneration may also involve genetic causes., Flushing the eyes with saline can help if you accidentally splash cleaning products or other substances in your eyes."

Go to a follow-up appointment.",How to Know if Laser Vision Surgery Is Right for You," Have a thorough eye exam with an ophthalmologist that specializes in laser vision surgery. The eye doctor will assess your eyes, making sure that you do not have any diseases of the eye or eye conditions that could impact the surgery.Before picking an eye doctor, do some research, either online or among people you know, on ophthalmologists that do laser surgery in your area. You want a doctor that is well respected and known for reliable work.
Don't pick the cheapest ophthalmologist just to save a few dollars, however, make sure that you are not paying an excessive amount to get a thorough and professional surgery.;
, You will need to discuss the ophthalmologist's findings to find out if you have any eye conditions that will prevent you from having your vision corrected with surgery. Conditions that could impact your ability to have laser vision surgery include thin corneas, glaucoma, herpes of the eye, large corneas, or inflammation of the eyelids. If your doctor says that you can't have the surgery, it means that they do not feel confident that they can complete the surgery successfully. For example, if you have thin corneas, the doctor may say they cannot do the surgery because they need the cornea to be thick enough to withstand the laser reshaping done in laser eye surgery. In this case, if your cornea is too thin and the doctor tries to reshape it, it could result in blindness.
Having one or more of these conditions doesn't automatically mean that you can't have the procedure, but it may mean that one type of procedure may be better than another.
If your vision prescription has changed in the last year, you shouldn't get the procedure done. This means that no one under 18 should get this surgery, as younger people's vision is likely to continue changing.
Tell your doctor if you have had any eye diseases or procedures in the past. This could impact their assessment.

, In order to get laser surgery you will need to be in good general health. This includes having no eye problems or eye injuries that you are currently recovering from.You should also avoid getting laser eye surgery if you’re pregnant or nursing.
If you are taking medications that could impact your healing, such as retinoic acid and steroids, then you should wait to have the surgery.

, Even if the surgery can be performed on your eyes, that doesn't mean that now is the right time for it. For example, you may have commitments or job requirements that could be negatively impacted by side effects from surgery. Think about your life and lifestyle and how this surgery could impact them.In general, the recovery time for laser eye surgery is very quick. You should be able to see clearly almost immediately, as long as things go as expected. However, if there are any complications, it could impact your ability to see clearly, which means that could impact your ability to work for a few days.

, In order to assess whether you should get surgery, you need to be aware of the risks associated with the procedure. While laser vision surgery does not require anesthesia, and thus the risks are lower than some other surgeries, there are some risks.Possible side effects and risks include double vision, blurriness, glare, astigmatism, dry eyes, over correction, and under correction.
Above all, any surgery to the eye does have the risk of causing blindness.

, Laser vision surgery is usually not covered by insurance, so you will have to pay for the procedure out of pocket. While the cost varies, it can cost between $1,000 to $3,000 per eye.Many eye surgery centers have payment plans available, so discuss payment options with your surgery center.

, After you have your eye exam, your doctor should tell you about your options for surgery. They will tell you what type of surgery will work best for you given the state of your eyes.


If your doctor gives you several options for surgical procedures, then you will need to do some research and decide between them.

, LASIK surgery is the most common laser vision surgery. During LASIK, a laser is used to resurface the outside of the cornea, removing any imperfections in the surface.In order to get LASIK you need a thick cornea. If your cornea is too thin, you should not have the procedure.
LASIK is an outpatient procedure that requires very little recovery time.

, LASEK surgery is similar to LASIK, except that it can be done on patients that have corneas that are too thin for LASIK because it does not require the same flap to be opened on the eye's surface. If your doctor suggests it, that probably means that your corneas are too thin for LASIK.Because LASEK destroys less cornea tissue than LASIK, it also is less likely to cause dry eyes afterward.

, PRK is another procedure that uses lasers to reshape the cornea. It was developed before LASIK and has been largely replaced by that process. However, PRK is still sometimes used for specific eye structures.Unlike with LASIK and LASEK, while recovering from PRK you will need to wear an eye patch over your eye., Vision Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) and Verisyse Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) are two types of laser surgery that can be used to correct your vision if you have cataracts in addition to vision problems.The procedure begins with an opening being made in the cornea and then a lens being placed between the cornea and the iris.


Only those with cataracts or risk factors for cataracts are usually given this type of surgery.

, Your doctor will give you specific directions about what to do before and after surgery. Follow these directions closely so that your experience is as easy as possible and so that the surgery goes well.Your doctor is likely to tell you to keep contacts out of your eyes for a week to three weeks before surgery, depending on the type of lens' you wear. They will also want you to make sure that you arrange a ride home after surgery, that you take all of your normal medications before surgery, and that you arrive on time with no makeup or perfume on.
After surgery you will want to avoid rubbing or touching your eyes for a week, use eye drops as directed, and avoid using makeup or lotion near your eyes for several days., While the results of laser eye surgery may be almost immediate, it is not unusual to have moments of blurriness for a few days after the surgery. However, even if you have moments of blurriness, your vision should be dramatically improved by the surgery.If you are having pain that is not controlled by the pain medication that you were prescribed after surgery, then call your doctor. This level of pain is not normal and needs to be addressed.

, You should schedule and go to a follow-up appointment after laser eye surgery. At this appointment, your doctor will look at your eyes and make sure that the surgery went as planned. They will also assure that the healing has gone well.

You should go to a follow-up visit within 24 to 48 hours of surgery."

Limit your exposure to hospitals.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Stop touching your eyes and mouth.,
Avoid touching hospital patients.,
Never touch any equipment or machines.,
Request that caregivers wash their hands before touching you.,
Insist that caregivers practice aseptic techniques.,
Don't use standard antibiotics.,
Use newer, stronger antibiotics.,
Consider using combination therapy instead.",How to Prevent Acinetobacter Infection," Acinetobacter bacteria pose very little risk to healthy people within their day-to-day lives; however, very ill people within hospitals, particularly if they have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or diabetes, are much more susceptible to Acinetobacter and risk dying from the infection.As such, the goal is to avoid being in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a patient or visitor.


Most people admitted to the ICU have little chance of preventing it, but following medical advice for any chronic lung diseases or diabetes can prevent your condition from taking a turn for the worse and needing emergency care.
Getting transferred out of the ICU into another part of the hospital for recovery may also reduce your risk of an Acinetobacter infection. Ask your care givers about your recovery options.
Healthy people aren't normally at risk, but visiting ill relatives at hospitals can increase it, especially if you spend significant time in the ICU.;
, A crucial way for reducing your risk of getting any type of bacterial or viral infection while staying in a hospital (or visiting one) is washing your hands properly and frequently. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom and after you touch any person (patient or hospital staff) or surface outside the bathroom. Be especially cautious with door knobs, light switches, bed railings, curtains, bedside tables and any type of medical equipment.


Warm water and regular soap is probably enough to sanitize your hands from bacteria, but consider using an alcohol-based cleaner also.
Use the paper towel you dried your hands with as a barrier against door knobs and bedside rails. Once you climb back into bed (as a patient), throw the paper towel away in the garbage.
Make sure to have some hand sanitizer within reach of your hospital bed at all times.

, Even if you're frequently sanitizing your hands as a patient or visitor to the hospital, try not to habitually touch your face (especially your mouth and eyes) with your hands. Bacteria on your hands are usually harmless, but they can enter your body through your mouth or eyes and become infectious. As such, focus on keeping your hands by your sides or on your lap.


If you don't wear eyeglasses, consider putting on some plastic eye protection to prevent touching or rubbing your eyes.
If you're a woman, be very cautious about transmitting bacteria (and other germs) while putting on eye makeup and lipstick. If you're a hospital patient, it's safer not to wear any makeup.Pay attention to other objects people commonly put in their mouths without thinking, like pens and pencils, and anything shared, like phones or games.

, While in a hospital, it may be tempting to compassionately touch patients, but that dramatically increases your risk of Acinetobacter infection — particularly if you're also a patient and quite ill. Hospital patients can harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria (such as Acinetobacter) on their skin, clothing or personal items.


Talking, listening and supporting hospital patients is certainly helpful, but avoid touching them, especially if they're in the ICU.
If you're a patient in a hospital, avoid sharing any towels, washcloths, razors or clothes with other patients.

Acinetobacter spreads to susceptible patients by person-to-person contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.
If you're near a coughing patient(s), consider wearing a surgical mask for additional protection. Bacteria can travel within droplets of saliva/mucus.

, Whether you're a patient or a visitor, never touch any medical equipment or machines while in a hospital or clinic setting, especially while in an ICU or emergency ward. They are often a source of bacteria and other microbes, and touching them may also alter their function or change the settings, which can be life-threatening.Don't let curiosity get the best you and keep your hands to yourself and let the professionals deal with and clean the medical equipment.


Medical equipment most likely to be contaminated with bacteria include urinary catheters, intravenous equipment and respiratory tubes/paraphernalia.
In general, any equipment that deals with giving or taking blood/urine/fluid from you is higher risk of being contaminated with Acinetobacter and other microbes.

, In addition to medical equipment and other patients, another source of Acinetobacter contamination is the hospital staff — doctors, nurses, assistants and technicians. They get trained on how to prevent spreading bacterial infections by washing their hands and keeping clean, but some are more conscientious about it than others. As such, remind or request that all hospital employees wash their hands and sanitize their equipment before treating and touching you.Offer them the use of your alcohol-based hand sanitizer if they don't have any. Be polite and try not to offend them.
Wearing disposable gloves protects hospital staff from patients, but ask caregivers to change their gloves in front of you for your protection from Acinetobacter and other harmful microbes.
Hospitals that have more conveniently placed hand sanitizer dispensers have higher hygiene compliance from staff — up to 80% or more., Aseptic techniques are procedures used in hospital settings designed to sterilize any equipment or treatment materials used on you during your stay.All diagnostic equipment and instruments used on you should be brand new (never used), sanitized with alcohol or covered in some sterile protective covering.


Caregivers should change their gloves, masks and sanitary covers just prior to treating each patient (preferably within your view).
Caregivers should not wear rings, jewelry and even watches while treating patients because they are hard to clean and keep sanitized.

, Acinetobacter, especially the baumannii strain, is recognized as a very difficult antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to control and treat.In general, the overuse of antibiotics within hospitals has created these drug resistant ""superbugs,"" and the incidence of potentially life-threatening Acinetobacter infections are increasing.


As such, first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and penicillins are virtually useless against Acinetobacter activity and may actually promote their growth.The most common problems caused by Acinetobacter colonization are bacteremia (blood infection), pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infections and wound infections., Acinetobacter is resistant to most antimicrobial drugs, but not all of the newer, stronger ones. Antibiotics usually effective against A. baumannii include carbapenems, polymyxins E and B, sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, tigecycline and aminoglycosides.Which one your doctor recommends depends mainly on where your bacterial infection is, how your immune system is combating it and your overall health.


As a general rule, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) are the top choice for treating A. baumannii, though carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter strains are becoming more common in the U.S. around the world.
Some other drugs used against A. baumannii include colistin, amikacin, rifampin and minocycline., Combination therapy means using two or more antibiotics at the same time within an infected patient. It has a synergistic effect on the drugs and makes them more powerful and effective — kind of like a 1-2 punch.However, side effects can be more severe also, and include stomach / intestinal problems, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Discuss the pros and cons of combo therapy with your doctor.


In general, combining rifampin with imipenem, tobramycin or colistin are the most effective, at least against Acinetobacter-caused pneumonia.
For most patients, monotherapy (using just one antibiotic) is just as effective as combination therapy, although if a patient is very ill with a severely weakened immune system, combo therapy is often their last hope.

Look for swelling at the bite site.,
Watch out for swelling of the eyelids.,
Keep track of any fever you experience.,
Pay attention to any sudden rashes.,
Check to see if your lymph nodes are swollen.,
Note any digestive problems you experience.,
Monitor fatigue and body aches.",How to Know if You Have Chagas Disease1," The swelling usually appears one week after the bite. The bite site becomes a boil-like, hard and violet colored lesion that may persist for several weeks. The swelling is due to multiplication of the parasite locally in the tissue that leads to inflammation. It is known as “Chagoma”.A chaga bite may be confused with other types of insect bites. However, the swelling of a bee sting or ant bite develops quickly and is extremely itchy while the swelling of a reduviid bug bite is less itchy.;
, If the parasite infects the conjunctiva there may be painless, non-itchy swelling of the eyelids. Your eyelids will then appear firm and reddish. They may also take on a purple hue. This symptom is known as Romana’s sign. There may also be swelling of the surrounding area if the infection spreads locally.This is a very reliable sign of Chagas disease. While other diseases can cause your eyelids to swell, chaga is the only one that results in painless, non-itchy swelling. Lid swelling due to bacterial or viral viral infections will be painful and itchy accompanied by watering. A stye caused by a bacterial infection causes development of boil like swelling in a single lid.

, Your fever will most likely be non-specific and low grade. It may also appear as a fever that lasts for a few hours a day and then disappears for the rest of the day and night.

, Chagas may cause a transient, non-itchy skin rash that resembles the rash you get when you have measles. Luckily, it is usually self limiting and resolves within a few days.

, Lymph nodes close to the site of infection might become swollen after the bite. The parasites will travel along lymph vessels to reach those lymph nodes where they induce inflammation. Swelling of the lymph nodes means they are responding and trying to kill or eliminate the invading organisms.


Lymph nodes fight against infection and are found in different parts of the body. In normal individuals, the lymph nodes cannot be felt or palpated. They are located beneath the skin of armpit, angle of mouth or neck.

, There may be loss of appetite, feeling of nausea, or the development of vomiting or diarrhea. However, these digestive problems are non-specific and result from many different health issues, so they are not the best measurements when trying to determine if you have chagas or not.

, These are also non-specific symptoms. Fatigue may develop because of the acute stress the infection is putting on your body. When the body recognizes an infection, it fights against the invading organisms, which in turn causes you to feel tired. A feeling of pain at different sites in the body is generally due to the toxic substances that are produced at the site of the infection and inflammation.

It is also common in hairy areas of the skin, such as the beard area, back of the neck, armpit, groin, legs, scalp, or buttocks., MRSA manifests as a bump or sore area on the skin. Many times this can be confused with insect bites, such as spider bites, or it may look like a pimple. Pay attention to any areas of skin that are red, inflamed, painful, or hot to the touch.Keep an eye on minor bumps, cuts, scrapes, and redness. If they become infected, see your doctor., MRSA can lead to cellulitis, which is an infection of the layers and tissues beneath the skin, which looks like a widespread swollen rash. This causes the skin to look pink or red. The skin may be warm, tender, or swollen.Cellulitis can start out as small red bumps. Some areas of the skin may look like a bruise., A rash is reddish colored areas on the skin. If you have widespread red areas, watch it carefully. If it is hot to the touch, spreads quickly, or painful, you may want to see your doctor., If you have a bump or lesion, look for a fluid filled cavity that is movable and compressible. Look for a yellow or white center with a head. There might also be draining pus., Boils are pus-filled infections of the hair follicles. Check in your scalp for bumps. Also check any other places with hair, like your groin, neck, and armpit., An abscess is a painful pus-filled lump in or under the skin. An abscess might require surgical drainage in addition to antibiotics.Keep an eye out for carbuncles. Carbuncles are large abscesses that has pus draining from them., A stye is an infection of the oil glands of the eyelid. This causes inflammation and redness on the eye and eyelid. The stye can be internal or external. The lump will usually have a whitish or yellowish head that looks like a pimple., Impetigo is a pus blister on the skin. These pus blisters can be large in size. They may burst and leave a honey-colored crust around the infected area., If your doctor has diagnosed you with staph infection and given you antibiotics, your condition should improve within two to three days. If you do not see any improvement, there is a chance that you have MRSA. Once you are colonized with MRSA it is likely that you can become reinfected more easily. Keep an eye on your condition, and be prepared to return to your doctor on short notice.

, Any of these symptoms might indicate a serious infection when coupled with a staph or MRSA diagnosis.The combination may feel similar to flu symptoms. You may also experience some dizziness and confusion.Take your temperature if you think you might be running a fever.A fever of 100.4 or higher is cause for concern., As the infection spreads through your body, it can choke the lungs; inflame your urinary tract; and even begin to eat your flesh. Untreated MRSA can result in necrotizing fasciitis, a rare but horrific flesh-eating disease.


Notice the signs that MRSA has spread to the lungs. If the infection is still undetected and left untreated, there is a risk that it can spread to the lungs. Look out for coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.A high fever and body chills, possibly accompanied by urinary tract infection, are signs that the MRSA has spread to other organs of the body, such as the kidneys and urinary tract.
Necrotizing fasciitis is very rare, but not unheard-of. This may manifest as a severe pain in the infected area.

, If you think that you're infected with any stage of MRSA, act as quickly as possible before the bacteria eats its way any deeper into your system. Even if you aren't sure: ask a doctor. MRSA can be a serious and life-threatening condition, and it isn't worth it to take any chances.Treatment for community-acquired MRSA is Bactrim and if you are hospitalized it is IV vancomycin.

Watch for a sore throat.,
Watch general signs of illness.,
Go to the doctor if the sore throat lasts more than 48 hours.",How to Know if Your Child Has Scarlet Fever1," Not all sore throats are caused by strep, but a sore throat is the most common symptom of strep. Be mindful of throat pain and difficulty or pain when swallowing. The effects of strep are often visible in the tonsils in the back of your child's throat. They may become red and swollen and might even develop white patches or show signs of pus., Strep throat is also known to cause fatigue, stomachache, vomiting, headache, and fever. Strep throat can also cause swollen lymph nodes: large protruding bumps in the neck, usually in the front.You normally shouldn’t be able to feel your lymph nodes. If they have grown to the point where you can feel them, it is likely that you have an infection. They might also be tender and reddish in color., Be similarly mindful if your child's sore throat is accompanied by swollen lymph nodes or if he or she develops a fever higher than 101 °F (38.3 °C)."

Follow up with your doctor to see how the treatment is working.",How to Heal a Herpes Outbreak Quickly1," While it might seem like a good idea to cover up your sores with a bandage, bandaging sores actually slows healing. The best way to speed up healing time for your herpes sores is to allow them to be exposed to air and run their course.If you suffer from genital herpes, wear loose fitting clothing and underwear to increase air flow to your genital region.;
, Picking at sores can cause infections, which may further increase the amount of time that it take for your sores to heal. Stop yourself if you catch yourself picking at your sores. Leave them be and they will heal much faster.If your sores are itchy or burning, use some ice or a cold compress to help relieve these symptoms.

, If you suffer from frequent or occasional herpes outbreaks, you should talk to your doctor about your treatment options. Although there is no cure for herpes, there are medications that can make it easier to live with the condition. Some medications can shorten the severity and duration of outbreaks, while others may prevent and reduce the total number of outbreaks that you have., Antiviral drugs are intended to treat herpes at the first sign of an outbreak. Speak with your doctor about having a prescription written to have on hand in the event you have early symptoms of an outbreak and are unable to reach him/her. Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are the most commonly prescribed antiviral medications.Follow your doctor’s instructions and take your medication as directed. Do not take more or less than your prescribed dosage.

, There are several different over the counter ointments for herpes, but you should consult your doctor before choosing one to use on your sores. If you have genital herpes, then you may need a prescription ointment.Consider using a propolis ointment. In one study, propolis ointment was found to be more effective than acyclovir ointment. People who used the propolis ointment four times a day reported that their sores healed faster than those who used acyclovir., After you have been taking an antiviral medication for a few months, it is a good idea to follow up with your doctor to determine if the treatment is working. If it is not producing the desired results, then your doctor may suggest a different course of treatment."

Watch for a distinctive red rash.,
Check for a fever.,
Look out for coughing, sore throat and a runny nose.,
Recognize who's at high risk.,
Make an appointment with your family doctor.,
Get the appropriate treatment.,
Avoid complications from the measles.",How to Identify Measles," The most identifiable sign of the measles is the rash it causes, which shows up a few days after the coughing, sore throat and running nose appear. The rash consists of many small red spots and bumps in tight clusters, some of which are slightly raised, but mostly it looks like large flat blotches from a distance.The head / face are the first to break out, with the rash showing up behind the ears and close to the hairline. Over the next couple of days, the rash spreads to the neck, arms and torso, then down the legs to the feet. The rash isn't itchy for most people, but can irritate those with sensitive skin.


People with measles typically feel the most ill on the first or second day after the rash develops, and then it takes about a week to fade completely away.Shortly after the rash appears, fever usually rises sharply and can reach or exceed 104 F. Medical attention may be necessary at this stage.
Many people with measles also develop small grayish-white spots in their mouth (inner cheeks), which are called Koplik's spots.;
, Measles typically begins with nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as malaise (tiredness) and a mild-to-moderate fever.Thus, if your child seems listless with a poor appetite and has a mild temperature, then chances are good they have a viral infection. However, most viral infections begin the same way, so a mild fever is not a strong identifier for measles by itself.


Normal body temperature is 98.6 F, so a fever for a child is any temperature over 100.4 F.A temperature greater than 104 F in children warrants medical attention.
A digital ear thermometer, also called a tympanic thermometer, is a quick and easy way to measure a child's temperature.
Measles has an incubation period of 10 to 14 days post infection, which is a period of no signs or symptoms.

, Just after you notice a mild-to-moderate fever in your child, then other symptoms quickly develop with measles. A persistent cough, sore throat, runny nose and inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) are typical of the early stages of the measles.This relatively mild collection of symptoms may last two or three days after the onset of the fever. These signs still don't clearly identify your child's illness as measles — other viral infections, such as the common cold and flu, cause very similar symptoms.


The cause of measles is the paramyxovirus, which is highly contagious. It spreads through droplets in the air or on surfaces, then replicates in the nose and throat of an infected person.
You can contract paramyxovirus by putting your fingers in your mouth / nose or by rubbing your eyes after touching any infected surface.Getting coughed or sneezed on by an infected person can spread the measles also.
A person infected with measles can spread the virus to other people for a period of about eight days — starting when symptoms begin and lasting until the fourth day of the rash (see below).

, While people who receive the complete vaccine series for measles have almost no risk of getting the disease, certain groups of people are at higher risk for measles. The most at risk are people who: don't get the entire measles vaccine series, have a vitamin A deficiency and/or travel to places where measles are common (Africa and parts of Asia, for examples).Other groups more susceptible to measles are those with weakened immune systems and children younger than 12 months old (because they are too young to be eligible to receive the vaccine).


The measles vaccine is usually combined with others that protect from the mumps and rubella. All combined, the vaccine is known as the MMR vaccine.
People who get immunoglobulin treatment and the MMR vaccine at the same time are also at higher risk of developing the measles.
Vitamin A has antiviral properties and is very important for the health of mucus membranes, which line the nose, mouth and eyes. If your diet is deficient in vitamin, you're more likely to get the measles and experience more severe symptoms.

, If you notice any of the above-mentioned symptoms in your child or yourself, make an appointment with your family physician or pediatrician for consultation and an examination. Measles in American children has been rare for well over a decade, so doctors who are recently graduated may not have much experience with the distinctive rash. However, all experienced doctors will immediately recognize the characteristic splotchy skin rash, and especially Koplik's spots on the inner lining of the cheek (if applicable).


If in doubt, a blood test can confirm whether the rash is actually measles.The medical lab will look for the presence of IgM antibodies in your blood, which are produced by your body to fight against the measles virus.
In addition, a viral culture can be grown and examined from secretions swabbed from your nasal passages, throat and/or inner cheeks — if you have Koplik's spots.

, There's no specific treatment that can get rid of an established case of measles, but some measures can be taken to reduce the severity of symptoms. Non-immunized people (including children) can be given the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to the paramyxovirus and it may prevent symptoms from developing.However, as noted above, it often takes 10 days of an incubation period before the mild symptoms of measles begin, so catching it within 72 hours is unlikely unless you're traveling to an area where many people obviously have the disease.


Immune boosting is available for pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immunity who are exposed to the measles (and other viruses). Treatment involves an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin, which ideally should be given within 6 days of exposure in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming severe.
Immune serum globulin and the MMR vaccine should not be taken at the same time.
Medications for reducing aches and pains, and the moderate-to-severe fever that accompanies the rash of measles include: acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Never give aspirin to children or teenagers with the measles to control fever. Aspirin is approved for use in kids older than 3 years, but it can lead to Reye's syndrome (potentially life-threatening condition) in those with chickenpox or flu-like symptoms — which can be confused with the measles. Give children acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) instead.

, Although potentially deadly (especially in developing countries), cases of the measles are rarely serious, nor require medical attention unless fevers get above 104 F. However, the potential complications from the measles are often much worse than the initial viral infection.Common complications stemming from the measles include: bacterial ear infections, bronchitis, laryngitis, pneumonia (viral and bacterial), encephalitis (brain swelling), pregnancy problems and reduced blood clotting ability.


If you are experiencing other symptoms after having measles or if you feel like your symptoms never went away, you should see your doctor.
If you have low levels of vitamin A, ask your doctor for a shot in order to reduce the seriousness of the measles and any potential complications. Medical dosages are usually 200,000 international units (IU) for two days."

Understand the indeterminate phase.,
Watch out for heart problems.,
Monitor digestive problems.,
Look for signs of megaesophagus.,
Go to the hospital if you see signs of megacolon.",How to Know if You Have Chagas Disease2," This is seen in 60% to 70% of the patients in the chronic phase. These patients do not have heart, gastrointestinal (esophagus or colon), and neurological (brain or nerves) symptoms of Chagas disease. Nevertheless, around 2% to 5% of these patients later have heart, esophagus and/or large intestinal or colonic symptoms. This form occurs eight weeks to ten weeks after the start of infection and is asymptomatic phase, which means it is without symptoms or signs of illness.

, Heart issues caused by chagas are referred to as Chagas Cardiac disease. If left untreated, the parasites gradually damage the heart. Heart muscles are destroyed with fibrous tissue formation. Heart chambers are dilated and muscles cannot contract rhythmically and efficiently, which may lead to heart failure.If you feel irregular heart beat or missed beat, it may be an early sign of heart malfunction.
If heart failure develops, there will be accumulation of fluid in the lungs. You will experience breathlessness, fatigue and nocturnal cough with frothy sputum.

, Long standing infection may damage nerves in your digestive tract. The esophagus (gullet) and colon are most commonly affected. They become dilated as there is loss of peristalsis, or the contraction of the intestine to propel food bolus from the mouth to the anus. You will either have issues with your esophagus or your colon., Megaesophagus is defined as the dilatation or enlargement of the esophagus. Symptoms of megaesophagus are difficulty in and painful swallowing to solid and/or liquid foods, difficulty of breathing, regurgitation, weight loss, and food aspiration. Due to this condition, previously-eaten food may go back towards the mouth and may pass through the windpipe and cause cough and pneumonia.

, Megacolon is defined as the dilatation or enlargement of the large intestine or the colon.Megacolon presents as constipation, impacted feces, or twisting of the large intestine. Symptoms of colonic infarction would be pain on the whole abdomen, passage of watery to loose stools (diarrhea), fever, and vomiting. Both colonic infarction and obstruction are emergencies requiring surgery.

Know that the Triatomine (reduviid) bug is the main cause of chagas.,
Know where this disease is most prevalent.,
Understand that you can get it through bad blood transfusion.,
Know that an infected mother may also have an infected baby, The parasite can cross the placenta and infect the baby in the mother’s womb.",How to Know if You Have Chagas Disease3," The bug acquires the infection while sucking the blood of an infected animal. The parasite then multiplies within the intestine of the bug and is excreted in its feces. The parasite enters you through the wound created when the bug bites you.Triatomine(reduviid) bugs usually come out at night for feeding when people tend to sleep. Their favorite site to bite is the face (which is why they are called “kissing bugs”).
The parasite can also enter the human body through the intact mucus membrane of the mouth or lips if the bug deposits excreta near the lips. Conjunctiva of the eye may be infected while rubbing the excreta against the eye.

, The kissing bug is found in parts of Central and South America. It generally lives in the walls and cracks of substandard houses, or out in the woods. The countries where it has been found include:


Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela.

, Sometimes, chagas disease does not have any symptoms that go along with it. If a person is asymptomatic, meaning they don’t have symptoms, and they donate blood, they might give someone else the disease.The same goes for organ donation if the donor is infected.

, In that case, the baby may be born with problems like abdominal swelling, jaundice, or lungs or heart defects.

Beware of rising temperatures.,
Be aware of impetigo.,
Look for a red rash.,
Look for strawberry tongue.,
Watch for peeling skin.,
See a doctor immediately.",How to Know if Your Child Has Scarlet Fever2," If the illness is progressing from strep throat to scarlet fever, you child's temperature will often begin to rise. Scarlet fever is generally accompanied by temperatures of 101 °F (38.3 °C) or higher. Sometimes your child will experience chills with the fever., Sometimes scarlet fever may occur with a streptococcal skin infection called impetigo, and not with a sore throat.Impetigo causes redness, bumps, blisters or pus in the skin, usually on the child's face, around the mouth and nose., The characteristic sign that strep has evolved into scarlet fever is a red rash. It will look like sunburn and feel rough to the touch, like sandpaper. If pressure is applied to the skin, it might briefly take on a paler hue.


The rash will typically begin around the face, neck, and chest (most common on neck and chest), spreading to the abdomen and back, and, less often, to the arms or legs.
Along the skin creases in the groin, armpit, elbows, knees, and neck your child might develop lines with an ever deeper reddish hue than the rest of the rash.It is common to have a circle of pale skin around the lips., This is caused by the enlargement of the taste buds on the tongue. At first, the taste buds will be covered with a white coating. After a few days, the tongue will generally develop a red, bumpy appearance., As the red rash begins to fade, your child's skin may begin to peel as if after a sunburn. Be mindful; that does not mean that the illness is gone. You should still seek medical attention., You should take your child to a doctor whenever he or she develops reddish skin accompanied by a fever and/or sore throat.Although scarlet fever is easily treated with antibiotics, if it is left untreated, it can cause an array of complications.


Untreated, scarlet fever can cause kidney disease, skin infection, ear infection, abscesses of the throat, lung infection, arthritis,heart problems and problems with the nervous system (rheumatic fever).

Be careful with children.,
Be mindful if your child has a weakened immune system.,
Be careful in crowded environments.,
Ensure that precautions are taken to limit the spread of the infection.",How to Know if Your Child Has Scarlet Fever3," Scarlet fever is most likely to affect children between the ages of 5 and 15. When someone within that age range develops symptoms of scarlet fever, you should be particularly cautious and take him or her to the doctor as soon as possible.

, If your child already suffers from an infection or any other disease that will weaken his or her immune system, he or she will be prone to bacterial infections like scarlet fever.

, The bacteria that causes scarlet fever lives in the nose and throat and is communicated by contact with liquids spread through coughing and sneezing. If you or your child touch something that someone has coughed or sneezed on, you are susceptible to contracting the disease that causes scarlet fever. This will is most likely to occur in crowded areas.Because young children are most susceptible to the disease, schools are a particularly common place to contract the disease.

, Your child should wash his or her hands frequently and refrain from sharing utensils, linens, towels, or other personal items with people. Individuals can be contagious even after they have ceased to be symptomatic.


Anyone diagnosed with scarlet fever should stay home for at least 24 hours after beginning treatment with antibiotics."

Reduce prolonged exposure to sunlight.,
Use a water based lubricant during sex.,
Find ways to manage your stress levels.,
Look into adding lysine to your diet.",How to Heal a Herpes Outbreak Quickly2," If you suffer from oral herpes, you may be more likely to experience an outbreak after spending a long time in the sun.You may be able to reduce your chances of developing an outbreak by reducing your exposure to direct sunlight.


Try staying in the shade or wearing a wide brimmed hat when you will be outside for long periods of time.

, The friction produced during sex may trigger an outbreak. To reduce friction during sex, use a water based lubricant. Always wear condoms as well if you suffer from genital herpes or you may pass the condition on to your partner.


Do not use a lubricant that is oil based or that has the spermicide nonoxynol-9 listed in its ingredients. Oil based lubricants can weaken condoms and nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes.Avoid sex when you are having an outbreak. You are more likely to transmit herpes when you are having an outbreak so it is best to avoid intercourse altogether when sores are present.

, Stress is a common cause of herpes outbreaks, so managing your stress is essential. Consider taking a yoga class, doing deep breathing exercises throughout your day, learning to meditate, or taking relaxing bubble baths on a regular basis. Find ways to relax and minimize your stress to help prevent outbreaks. Some other ways that you can reduce stress include:Getting more exercise. Exercise can help you to stay healthy and manage stress. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.
Eating better. A well-balanced diet can help you to feel better and reduce stress. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid junk foods.
Sleep more. Sleep deprivation can contribute to excess stress. Make sure that you are getting at least seven hours of uninterrupted sleep every night.
Stay connected. Reaching out to someone when you are feeling overwhelmed can also help reduce your stress levels. Call up a friend to talk to if you are feeling stressed.

, Lysine is an amino acid that is used for preventing and treating cold sores.Lysine acts by blocking the action of arginine (which increases the multiplication of the herpes virus). Lysine may be taken whenever you are having a herpes outbreak or prior to onset of symptoms.


Talk to your doctor before deciding to include Lysine as a supplement, especially if you have kidney disease or if you are pregnant or nursing.Follow the product instructions if you decide to include Lysine as a supplement.

Look for an abscess or boil.The first symptom of MRSA is a raised, pus-filled abscess or boil that's firm to the touch and feels warm.,
Distinguish between MRSA boils and bug bites.The early abscess or boil can look incredibly similar to a simple spider bite.,
Watch for fever.Though not all patients get a fever, you may get one greater than 100.4°F (38°C).,
Be alert for symptoms of sepsis.,
Do not ignore symptoms.",How to Get Rid of MRSA1," This red blemish may have a “head” like a pimple, and can range in size from 2 to 6 centimeter (0.79 to 2.4 in) or larger. It can appear anywhere on the body, and will be extremely tender. For example, if it's on the buttocks, you likely won't be able to sit from the pain.


A skin infection without a boil is less likely to be MRSA, but should still be checked by a doctor. More likely, you need to be treated for a Streptococcus infection or susceptible staph aureus.;
, One study showed that 30% of Americans who reported a spider bite were found to actually have MRSA.Especially if you're aware of a MRSA outbreak in your area, err on the side of caution and get tested by a medical professional.


In Los Angeles, MRSA outbreaks were so high the public health department raised billboards showing a picture of a MRSA abscess with the text “This is not a spider bite.”
Patients didn’t take their antibiotics, believing their doctors were wrong and had misdiagnosed spider bites.
Be vigilant for MRSA, and always follow medical advice.

, This can be accompanied by chills and nausea.

, ""Systemic toxicity"" is rare, but possible if the MRSA infection is in the skin and soft tissue. While in most cases, patients can bide their time and wait for test results to confirm MRSA, sepsis is life threatening and needs immediate treatment. Symptoms include:Body temperature over 101.3°F (38.5°C) or below 95°F (35°C)
Heart rate faster than 90 beats per minute
Rapid breathing
Swelling (edema) anywhere on the body
Altered mental state (disorientation or unconsciousness, for example)

, In some cases, MRSA might resolve on its own without treatment.The boil may burst on its own, and your immune system may fight off the infection; however, MRSA can be more serious in people with weak immune systems.If the infection worsens, bacteria could make their way into the bloodstream, causing potentially fatal septic shock. Furthermore, the infection is highly contagious, and you could get a lot of other people sick if you neglect your own treatment.

Rest.,
Increase your fluid intake.,
Apply a hot compress.,
Take a hot shower.",How to Dry Up Mucus1," If you’re dealing with an infection, getting plenty of rest will help your body recuperate. You will probably still have responsibilities to take care of, but try not to push yourself beyond what absolutely needs to get done.If you have a bacterial sinus infection, you may need and antibiotic as well as mucoactive agents to dry up the mucus, such as Mucinex.;
, Drinking an adequate amount of water daily will cause mucus to lose its thickness and help clear the nasal passages.Caffeine-free tea and soup are common cold remedies for this reason.
Try sipping on peppermint tea or eating some pineapple. The menthol in peppermint and the bromelain in pineapple might help to reduce the coughing mucus causes.Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, by contrast, can increase mucus production and dehydrate the body.

, Wet a clean washcloth with warm water and squeeze out the excess water. Then, cover the nose and cheeks with the hot washcloth compress. The heat from the washcloth will loosen the mucus and reduce the pain caused by congestion.Heat will help dilute the mucus (which is mostly solid in nature), resulting in easier release when you blow your nose.

, The steam from the shower opens up your nasal passages, which allows mucus to pass through easily. Taking warm showers will also help dry up mucus because the steam is able to open up the nasal passages so that mucus can easily pass through. Remember that during nasal congestion the nasal passages are all blocked up, and steam works with heat to thin the mucus, allowing for easier mechanical release.Steam inhalation also works — boil a pot of water, then remove it from the heat. Get a blanket or any cloth that can cover your face and the pot of boiling water, and inhale the steam so that it can loosen the mucus. Be very careful not to burn yourself on the pot or the hot steam; keep your face at least 12 inches above the water. Try adding a few drops of essential oils such as tea tree oil, peppermint oil, or eucalyptus oil to help open up your sinuses.
You may also find that using a humidifier helps ease your symptoms.

Consult with your doctor about surgical options.",How to Diagnose Piriformis Syndrome," Research indicates that women are six times more likely to have piriformis syndrome than men.Piriformis syndrome occurs most commonly in people between ages 30 and 50.The higher rate of diagnosis among women may be explained by the difference in biomechanics in men's and women's pelvises. Women may also develop piriformis syndrome during pregnancy. Because the pelvis widens during pregnancy, it can cause the attached muscles to contract. Pregnant women also often develop a pelvic tilt to accommodate the baby's weight, which can also lead the attached muscles to become tight.;
, You may be more likely to be diagnosed with piriformis syndrome if you have certain other medical conditions, such as low back pain.About 15% of cases are due to a congenital or structural anomaly concerning the relationship between the piriformis muscle and the sciatic nerve., The majority of cases of piriformis syndrome are caused by what doctors call “macrotraumas” or “microtraumas.”A macrotrauma is caused by a significant traumatic event, such as a fall or a car accident.Macro-trauma to the buttocks, which leads to inflammation of the soft tissue, muscle spasms, and nerve compression, is a common cause of piriformis syndrome.A microtrauma is a pattern of repeated minor injury to an area. For example, long-distance runners expose their legs to constant micro-trauma, which can eventually cause nerve inflammation and muscle spasm. Running, walking, climbing stairs, or even sitting for long periods of time can cause your piriformis muscle to compress and entrap the sciatic nerve, causing pain.Another form of microtrauma that may cause piriformis syndrome is “wallet neuritis.” This condition can occur when a person carries a wallet (or cellphone) in his back pocket, which can press against the sciatic nerve, causing irritation., One of the more common symptoms of piriformis syndrome is pain felt in the buttocks, where the piriformis is located. If you consistently feel sharp pain in one of your buttocks, you may have piriformis syndrome.Other pain to look out for that could indicate this condition includes:Pain when sitting, standing, or lying down for longer than 15 to 20 minutes.
Pain radiating down the back of your thigh, and sometimes into the back of the calf and into the foot.
Pain that improves when you move around and gets worse when you sit still.
Pain that is not completely relieved by a change of position.
Groin and pelvic pain. This may include pain in the labia for women and pain in the scrotum for men.Dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) in women.Painful bowel movements.

, The compression of your sciatic nerve caused by piriformis syndrome can cause difficulty walking. Your leg may feel weakened as well. The two main things to look for when experiencing difficulty walking include:


Antalgic gait, which means a gait that develops to avoid pain. This usually leads to limping or shortening your gait to keep from feeling pain.Foot drop, which is when your forefoot drops without your control because of pain in your lower leg.You may not be able to pull the foot up towards your face.

, When your sciatic nerve becomes compressed due to piriformis syndrome, you may begin to feel a numb or tingling sensation in your foot or leg.These sensations, or “parasthesias,” may present as “pins and needles,” numbness, or tingling., Piriformis syndrome is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are generally the same as the more common lumbar radiculopathy (numbness in the leg caused by low back pain). Both conditions are caused by the compression of the sciatic nerve. The only difference is where the sciatic nerve is being compressed. Piriformis syndrome is far more rare than low back pain, and most primary care physicians are not given much training in this syndrome. Instead, consider seeing an orthopedist, a specialist in physical medicine, or an osteopathic physician.


You may need to see your primary care physician first to ask for a referral to a specialist.

, Your doctor may need to conduct an extensive physical exam and perform tests before reaching a diagnosis.


Some tests, such as a MRI, CT scan, or nerve conduction study, may be used to rule out other conditions such as a herniated disc., To determine if you have piriformis syndrome, your doctor will begin by evaluating your range of motion by asking you to perform several exercises including straight leg raises and leg rotations. There are a number of other tests that can indicate the presence of piriformis syndrome, including:



The Lasègue sign: Your doctor will ask you to lie on your back, flex your hip at a 90 degree angle, and extend your knee straight out. A positive Lasègue sign means that pressure on the piriformis muscle while you are in this position causes you pain. The Freiberg Sign: In this test, your doctor will internally rotate and lift your leg while you lie flat on your back. Pain in your buttocks when doing this movement may indicate piriformis syndrome.The Pace Sign: In this test, you will lie on the unaffected side. Your doctor will flex your hip and knee, then rotate your hip while press down on your knee. If you feel pain, you may have piriformis syndrome.Your doctor may also “palpate” (examine with the fingers) your greater sciatic notch, a notch in one of your pelvic bones through which the piriformis muscle passes., Your doctor will likely test your affected leg for sensory changes or a loss of sensation. For example, your doctor may lightly touch your affected leg or use an implement to cause a sensation. The affected leg will have noticeably less sensation than the unaffected leg.

, Your doctor should check your muscle strength and size. Your affected leg will be weaker and may be shorter than your unaffected leg. Your doctor can also palpate your gluteus (the largest muscle in your buttocks) to determine the condition of the piriformis muscle. When the muscle is very tight and contracted, it can feel like a sausage.
Your doctor will also check the amount of pain you experience from pressure on your gluteus muscle. If you experience pain or tenderness deep in the buttocks or hip region, this is a sign that your piriformis muscle is contracted.
Your doctor will likely check for gluteal atrophy (shrinkage of the muscle). In chronic cases of piriformis syndrome, the muscle begins to wither and shrink. This can be seen in visual asymmetry, where the affected buttock is smaller than the unaffected buttock.

, While doctors can check for signs by performing physical tests, there are currently no diagnostic tests that can fully diagnose piriformis syndrome. Because of this, your doctor may order a computed tomography scan (CAT scan or CT scan) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine whether something else is compressing your sciatic nerve.A CT scan uses computer processes with x-rays to create 3D views of the inside of your body. This is achieved by taking cross-section views of your spine. A CT scan may help identify whether there are abnormalities near the piriformis muscle and can track any arthritic changes.An MRI uses radio waves and strong magnetic fields to create images of the inside of your body. An MRI can rule out other causes of low back pain or sciatic nerve pain.

, Electromyography tests the reaction of muscles when they are stimulated with electricity. This method is often used when a doctor is trying to figure out whether you have piriformis syndrome or a herniated disc. If you have piriformis syndrome, the muscles around your piriformis will react normally to electromyography. On the other hand, your piriformis muscle and gluteus maximus will react abnormally to the electricity. If you have a herniated disc, all of the muscles in the area may react abnormally. Electromyography tests have two components:A nerve conduction study will use electrodes taped to your skin to evaluate your motor neurons.
A needle electrode exam will use a small needle inserted into your muscles to evaluate your muscles’ electrical activity.

, Your doctor may recommend that you temporarily cease activities that cause the pain, such as running or cycling.If your pain is caused by the pressure from sitting for long periods of time, take regular breaks to get up and stretch. Doctors recommend that you get up, walk around, and lightly stretch every 20 minutes. If you are driving for long periods of time, take frequent breaks to stand and stretch.Avoid sitting or standing in the positions that cause pain., Physical therapy treatment is generally beneficial, especially if it is started early. Your doctor can work with your physical therapist to come up with a regimen that’s right for you.Your physical therapist will probably guide you through a series of stretches, flexion, adduction, and rotation exercises.
Soft-tissue massage of the gluteal and lumbosacral regions may also help relieve irritation.

, Chiropractic, yoga , acupuncture, and massagehave all been used to treat piriformis syndrome.


Because alternative medicine practices generally have not been scientifically researched to the same degree as more conventional medical approaches, you may want to consider discussing these methods with your doctor before beginning treatment., Sometimes piriformis symptoms can be caused by trigger points, or more commonly known as muscle knots. These knots are usually present in the piriformis or gluteal muscles. Pressure on these knots can produce local and referred pain. Most of the time, trigger points can mimic"" a piriformis syndrome. This is one reason why a lot of medical tests may come back negative, and may be the reason why doctors may underdiagnose this condition.Seek a health professional that has training in trigger point therapy, such as a massage therapist, chiropractor, physical therapist or even a physician. If trigger points are the cause, a combination of acupressure, stretching and strengthening exercises will often be recommended., In addition to the exercises your physical therapist has you do, your doctor can recommend stretches for you to do at home. Common exercises include:Roll side to side while lying down. Flex and extend the knees while you are lying on each side. Repeat, alternating sides, for five minutes.
Stand with your arms relaxed at your sides. Rotate side to side for one minute. Repeat every few hours.
Lie flat on your back. Raise your hips with your hands and pedal your legs as though you were riding a bicycle.
Do knee bends six times every few hours. You can use a countertop or chair for support if necessary.

, Applying moist heat can loosen muscles, while applying ice after exercise can decrease pain and inflammation.To apply heat, try using a heating pad, or place a damp towel in the microwave for a few seconds before applying it to the area.You can also take a warm bath, which can help relieve the tension and irritation of piriformis syndrome. Allow your body to be buoyant in the water.To apply cold, use ice wrapped in a towel or a cold pack. Do not apply the ice or cold pack for more than 20 minutes., Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, help relieve pain and inflammation.They are generally recommended to treat pain and inflammation from piriformis syndrome.Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (Aleve).
Ask your doctor before using NSAIDs. They may interact with other medications or medical conditions.
If NSAIDs do not provide sufficient relief, your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants. Use these as directed., If you continue to experience pain in your piriformis area, talk with your doctor about local injections, which can include anesthetics, steroids, or botox.


Anesthetic injections, which commonly include lidocaine or bupivacaine injected directly into the trigger point, are successful in approximately 85% of cases in conjunction with physical therapy.If local anesthetics do not relieve your pain, your doctor may recommend an injection of steroids or botulinum toxin type A (botox), both of which have been shown to relieve muscle pain., Surgery is considered a last-resort treatment for piriformis syndrome and will not be used until all other options have been exhausted. However, if none of the other treatments relieve your pain, you may wish to consult with your doctor about the possibility of surgical intervention.Surgical decompression of the piriformis muscle is only effective when neurologic deficits are present. The doctor will use electromyography and other tests to determine whether compressive neuropathy surgery, which will release the sciatic nerve, is necessary to relieve your pain. "

TB is usually active right after the initial infection and at points years later when it resurges. The symptoms of TB are similar to those of some other diseases, so it's important to be evaluated by a doctor to make sure you receive the correct diagnosis. Symptoms of active TB include:Coughing that lasts at least three weeks
Coughing up blood
Chest pain
Discomfort when breathing or coughing
Fever
Chills
Night sweats where you wake up soaking wet
Exhaustion
Loss of appetite
Weight loss;
, People with TB often go through periods, even years, when the bacteria remain in their bodies but cause no symptoms. Latent TB can resurge into active TB. If you are vulnerable to TB and there is a possibility you were exposed to the bacteria or you are showing symptoms, then it is important you get tested. People who are at a higher risk for carrying latent TB include:People with suppressed immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS
People with diabetes, serious kidney disease, and some forms of cancer
People undergoing chemotherapy or taking drugs to prevent their bodies from rejecting transplanted organs
People taking certain drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis
IV drug users and smokers
Family members and people in close contact with an infected person
Healthcare workers who treat people with a high risk
People suffering severe malnutrition
Children and the elderly
People living or working in crowded residential facilities including prisons, immigration centers, nursing homes, or refugee camps
People who have traveled or lived in Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, Russia, Latin America, or the Caribbean Islands

, When you go for an exam, the doctor will likely listen to your lungs and palpate your lymph nodes to for signs of infection. There are several tests that the doctor may also want you to have. These include:A skin test. During this test the doctor injects PPD tuberculin under the skin of your forearm. After two to three days the doctor will look at the site to see if you have a bump. If you do, it suggests you may have TB. This test can produce both false positives and false negatives. You may produce a false positive if you have received the bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine against TB. You may give a false negative if you’ve been infected so recently that you have not yet mounted an immune response.
A blood test. The blood test is more sensitive and more accurate than the skin test. The doctor will likely order the blood test if there is reason to doubt the results of the skin test.
Imaging tests. If your skin test came out positive, the doctor will likely want to check your lungs with an X-ray, a CT scan, or an endoscopy. During an endoscopy, a small camera on a long tube is inserted into your body to allow the doctor to examine the infected area more closely. If the doctor expects that the TB has infected an area of your body beyond the lungs, the doctor may request a CT, MRI, or ultrasound scan of that area too.
A biopsy of the infected area. The sample would then be tested for TB bacteria.
Sputum tests. The doctor is likely to request a sputum test if the image tests show evidence of an infection. The samples can be used to determine what strains of TB you have. This helps the doctor select the right medications for you. A positive result for TB will be available in one to two days, but it can take up to one to two months for the specific strain to be identified. These results are important for refining a course of treatment for drug-resistant TB. This test is also used to monitor someone with active TB — once you return negative sputum test, then you will be removed from quarantine and no longer be considered infectious.

, Most tuberculosis treatments require taking medications for six to nine months. Which medications you are prescribed will depend on which strain of TB you have. TB medications can damage your liver, so tell your doctor if you have any liver problems. Common medications include:Isoniazid. This medication can cause nerve damage. Tell your doctor if your hands or feet feel numb or tingle. You will also be given vitamin B6 to lessen the risk.
Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane). This medication can interfere with some types of birth control, including the combined contraceptive pill. If you are given this medication, use condoms as a backup method of birth control.
Ethambutol (Myambutol). This medication can be harmful to your eyes. If you receive this medication, you should have a vision test when you start taking it.
Pyrazinamide. This will be used in conjunction with other medications and may cause mild joint or muscle pain.

, If so, you may need to take a combination of drugs and possibly take some newer medications to which the TB is less likely to be resistant. You may also need to take medications for a year-and-a-half to two-and-a-half years. Tell your doctor before you start if you have a history of liver problems. Possible medications include:Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
Injectable medications such as amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin
Bedaquiline
Linezolid

, Tuberculosis medications can damage your liver, so it is very important to notify your doctor if you experience side effects. If you have side effects from the medications, do not stop taking them. This can produce a drug resistant strain. Instead, talk to your doctor to discuss what you can do to switch to another medication or alleviate the side effects. Possible side effects include:Nausea
Vomiting
Lack of hunger
Jaundice
Passing dark urine
A fever for three or more days
Tingling or loss of feeling in your extremities
Blurred vision
A rash or itchiness

, You will probably not need to be quarantined during your treatment; however, you should be careful to minimize the likelihood of transmitting it. You can do this by:Staying home from work or school until your doctor says you can return
Not sharing a room when you sleep
Covering your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or laugh
Opening windows to bring in fresh air
Throwing used tissues away in a sealed bag

, After a few weeks you will probably start to feel better. This doesn’t mean that you are cured, so do not stop taking the antibiotics. Keep taking the medications exactly as prescribed.


If you stop the medications before the TB is fully eradicated from your system, the surviving bacteria may become resistant to the drugs you took. This means that when you get sick again with it, it will be harder to treat., In places where TB is more common, infants are often vaccinated with the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against TB. The vaccine is not routinely given in the US, but if you expect to be at a higher risk, then ask your doctor if it is likely to be useful for you. You may be at a higher risk if:You will be living and working in a country where TB is more common.
You have a lowered immune system making you more vulnerable to contracting TB if you are exposed. People who have a higher risk are those who have HIV/AIDS, who are taking immune suppressing medications, or are receiving chemotherapy.

, TB is spread through droplets, so if you wear a respirator it lessens your chances of infection if you live with someone who has recently been diagnosed. You cannot wear just any surgical or medical mask, however. You must wear a specific respirator mask (such as N95 disposable respirators) to protect yourself from TB. The person with TB should also wear a respirator. Keep the respirator on for the first three weeks of treatment. In addition, the infected person should:


Open windows to ventilate the room she is in.
Sleep in a separate room to reduce the amount of time you spend breathing the same air.
Stay home from work or school.

, The treatment requires a long course of medications, but it is important that they be completed without skipping any doses. This protects both the infected person and those around him, because:


It reduces the likelihood of the bacteria developing resistance to the medications.
Drug resistant strains are much more difficult to eradicate if they spread to others.

See a doctor for proper diagnosis.Most healthcare providers see many cases each week and should easily be able to diagnose MRSA.,
Use a warm compress.Hopefully, you saw a doctor as soon as you suspected MRSA and caught the infection before it became dangerous.,
Allow a doctor to drain MRSA lesions.,
Keep the wound clean.After draining, the doctor will wash out the wound with a needle-less syringe, then pack it tightly with strips of gauze.,
Take any prescribed antibiotics.",How to Get Rid of MRSA2," The most obvious diagnostic tool is the characteristic boils or abscesses. But for confirmation, the doctor will swab the site of the lesion and a lab will test it for the presence of the MRSA bacteria.


However, it takes about 48 hours for the bacteria to grow, rendering immediate testing inaccurate.New molecular tests that can detect MRSA’s DNA in a matter of hours are becoming more widely available., The first, early treatment for MRSA is to press a warm compress against the boil to draw the pus to the surface of the skin. This way, when the doctor cuts the abscess to drain it, she'll be more successful in removing all the pus. Antibiotics may help speed up the process. In some cases, the combination of antibiotics and warm compresses may cause spontaneous draining without actually having to cut the lesion.


Soak a clean washcloth in water.
Microwave it for about two minutes, or until it's as warm as you can stand without burning your skin.
Leave it on the lesion until the cloth cools down. Repeat the process three times per session.
Repeat the entire warm compress session four times each day.
When the boil has softened up and you can clearly see pus in the center of it, it is ready to be surgically drained by your doctor.
Sometimes though, this can make the area worse. The heat pack may be quite painful and your wound may get bigger, redder, and much worse. Discontinue the heat packs and call your doctor if that happens.

, Once you've brought the bacteria-filled pus to the surface of the lesion, the doctor will cut it open and drain the pus out safely. First, she will anesthetize the area with Lidocaine and cleanse it with Betadine. Then, using a scalpel, she will make an incision in the ""head"" of the lesion and drain it of infectious pus. She will apply pressure all around the lesion, like pushing pus out of a popped zit, to make sure all infectious material is squeezed out. The doctor will send the extracted fluid to a lab to test it for responsiveness to antibiotics.


Sometimes, there are honeycomb-like pockets of infections under the skin. These need to be broken up by using a Kelly clamp to hold the skin open while the doctor addresses the infection under the surface.
Because MRSA is largely resistant to antibiotics, draining is the most effective way to treat it., He'll leave a ""wick"" out so you can pull the gauze out at home to clean the wound in the same manner every day. Over time (usually about two weeks), the wound will get smaller and smaller until you can't fit gauze in it anymore. Until that happens, though, you should wash out the wound every day.

, Don't pressure your doctor to prescribe antibiotics against her recommendation, as MRSA does not respond well to them.Over-prescribing antibiotics only helps infections become more resistant to treatment; however, there are two approaches to antibiotic treatments in general — for mild and for severe infections. Your doctor may suggest the following:Mild to moderate infection: take one Bactrim DS tablet every 12 hours for two weeks. If you're allergic to it, take 100mg of Doxycycline on the same schedule.
Severe infection (IV delivery): Receive 1 gm of Vancomycin through an IV for at least an hour; 600 mg of Linezolid every 12 hours; or 600 mg of Ceftaroline for at least an hour every 12 hours.
The infectious disease consultant will determine the length of your IV therapy.

Educate yourself on MRSA-preventing hygiene.Because MRSA is so infectious, it's important that everyone in the community take be careful about hygiene and prevention, especially when there's a local outbreak.,
Take extra care in shared or crowded spaces.Because MRSA spreads so easily, you must be especially aware of risks in crowded situations.,
Use hand sanitizer.Throughout the day, you come into contact with all sorts of shared bacteria.,
Wash household surfaces with bleach.A diluted bleach solution is effective at fighting the MRSA bug in your home.,
Don't rely on vitamins or natural therapies.",How to Get Rid of MRSA3,"


Use lotions and soaps from pump-bottles. Dipping your fingers into a jar of lotion or sharing a bar of soap with others can spread MRSA.
Don't share personal items like razors, towels, or hairbrushes.
Wash all bed linens at least once a week, and wash towels and washcloths after each use.

, These might include shared areas of a home or crowded public spaces like nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and gyms. Though many common areas are regularly disinfected, you never know when the last cleaning was or who may have been in the area before you. It's wise to place a barrier down if you're concerned.


For example, bring your own towel to the gym and place it between yourself and the equipment. Wash the towel immediately after use.
Make good use of antibacterial wipes and solutions provided by the gym. Disinfect all equipment before and after use.
If showering in a shared space, wear flip-flops or plastic shower shoes.
You are at increased risk of infection if you have any cuts or have a compromised immune system (like with diabetes).

, It may be that the person who touched a doorknob before you had MRSA, and touched his nose just before opening the door. It's a good idea to use hand sanitizer throughout the day, especially when in public. Ideally, the sanitizer will contain at least 60% alcohol.


Use it at the supermarket, when receiving change from cashiers.
Children should use hand sanitizer or wash their hands after playing with other children. Teachers who interact with children should follow the same standard.
Whenever you feel you may be exposed to potential infection, use hand sanitizer just to be safe.

, Incorporate it into your housekeeping routine during community outbreaks to decrease your risk of infection.


Always dilute bleach before cleaning with it, as it could discolor your surfaces.Use a 1:4 ratio of bleach to water. For example, add 1 cup of bleach to 4 cups of water to clean your household surfaces.

, Studies have not been able to show that vitamins and natural therapies can improve our immune systems enough to ward off MRSA. The only study that seemed promising, in which subjects were given ""mega-doses"" of vitamin B3, had to be disavowed because the dosage itself was unsafe."

Proceed with caution.,
Take oral decongestants to alleviate congestion.,
Try cough suppressants and expectorants.,
Use nasal corticosteroid sprays.,
Take oral antihistamines.,
Irrigate your nasal passages.",How to Dry Up Mucus2," Over-the-counter medicines like oral decongestants and nasal sprays can be very effective if you have excess mucus but still need to function at work or school; however, you should not take them for longer than about three days.Taking these products for longer than three days can lead to a boomerang effect in which your mucus builds up even more than it did before.
Many of these products also have side effects, including increased blood pressure and heart rate.

, Decongestants give relief to nasal congestion by reducing the swelling of the nasal tissues in the nasal passages. The mucus is dried up in the lungs, allowing the airway passages to open. The mucus is able to easily pass through, preventing an increase in mucus production.Over-the-counter (OTC) decongestants come in 12 hour or 24 hour treatments. Try Tylenol Cold and Flu or Advil Cold and Sinus.
Decongestants are prepared in different forms such as pills, liquids, and nasal sprays.
Before taking decongestants, take the time to read the label and ingredients of the medications.
If you have hypertension, seek medical counsel before taking any decongestants that contain the active ingredients phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, because these can elevate blood pressure.

, A cough suppressant, such as dextromethorphan, inhibits the cough reflex and reduces the adhesiveness and surface tension of mucus. This allows mucus to exit the body more easily, helps relieve chest pain caused by excessive coughing, and removes secretions from the upper and lower airways.Guaifenesin (Mucinex) is a cough expectorant that thins the mucus for faster and easier release from the respiratory passage.


You may benefit from a medication that combines both dextromethorphan and guaifenesin, such as Robitussin DM.
Side effects that you need to watch out for include nausea and vomiting, headache, and dizziness.

, Nasal spray is medication that is sprayed directly into the nasal cavity. Nasal spray can narrow the blood vessels that line the nose, shrinking the nasal tissue and reducing the swelling inside the nose and sinuses. This helps stop the production of extra mucus and eases the clearing of the nasal pathways, making breathing easier and drying up mucus faster.You will need to see a doctor to get a prescription for nasal steroids, such as Flonase.

, Antihistamine cold medications block histamines, substances that can trigger allergic reactions and cause the tissue in your nose to swell and release mucus.Common over-the-counter antihistamines that dry up mucus include diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and loratidine (Claritin).


Antihistamines should be taken once at bedtime.
Note that drowsiness is one side effect of antihistamines, so never take the medication if you are going for a drive or operating other heavy machinery.
Also be wary of other side effects such as headache, dizziness, and dry mouth.
Antihistamines should not be taken with expectorants.
If your allergies are persistent and severe, talk to your doctor about allergy shots., Also called nasal lavage, nasal irrigation is the process of draining the nasal passages manually, using water. The principle behind nasal irrigation is that you shoot a solution of salty water (saline) up one nostril in order to loosen the mucus build up and then drain it out on the other nostril. This can remove build up and hasten drying.You can either use a Neti pot or a bulb syringe.
Make sure that the solution you are using (salt water) comes from sterile, distilled, or boiled water to prevent the introduction of bacteria.
Remember to properly rinse the irrigation device after every use and air dry it afterwards.
Limit the use of nasal irrigation, because frequent irrigation can wash out some of the natural protective substances that help fight off infections.
Gargling with salt water can have a similar effect."
"
Thank mucus for keeping your lungs clear.,
Notice your body’s response.,
Don’t put too much faith in color.",How to Dry Up Mucus3," Although you might not be aware of it, your body is making mucus all the time, sometimes as much as a quart per day.Even when you are feeling perfectly fine, cells in your nose and mouth called “goblet cells” are combining water, proteins, and polysaccharides into mucus, forming its characteristic sticky texture.There is a very important reason for this: because mucus is sticky, it is able to trap irritating or dangerous particles before they reach your lungs.Without mucus, the particles of dust and dirt that you may see when you blow your nose would end up inside your body., When you are sick, your body produces more mucus to ward off the invader, be it a virus or bacteria.This is why you often only notice mucus when you are sick. Under normal circumstances, you are able to swallow mucus at the same pace that your body produces it, but under adverse circumstances, mucus is being produced faster and in greater quantities, leading the excess to clog your nose.
When mucus mixes with saliva and white blood cells, it becomes phlegm.
Mucus production can also be stimulated by food, environmental factors, allergens, cigarette smoke, chemicals, and perfumes.
When this increased production happens, your sinuses can get blocked, leading to the buildup of bacteria and possibly a sinus infection.

, Many people believe that the color of your mucus reveals the kind of affliction you are dealing with. While there is some usefulness in these guides, doctors do not really use them to make diagnoses or prescribe treatments.Generally, healthy mucus should be clear.
If your mucus is cloudy or white, you may have a cold.
Yellow or green mucus may signal a bacterial infection.
If you’re trying to figure out whether you have a cold or a sinus infection, a better gauge is how long your symptoms last. With a cold, you will usually have a runny nose followed by a stuffy nose, each lasting for two or three days. Sinus infections can linger for a week or more."
"
Learn the difference between the types of MRSA.,
Protect yourself with gloves.If you work in a medical setting, you absolutely must wear gloves when interacting with patients.,
Wash your hands regularly.This is perhaps the most important practice for preventing the spread of infectious diseases.,
Pre-screen all new patients for MRSA.When you're dealing with patients' body fluids — whether through sneezing or through surgery — it's best to pre-screen for MRSA.,
Isolate patients suspected to have MRSA.The last thing you want in a crowded hospital setting is for an infected patient to come into contact with uninfected patients there for other reasons.,
Make sure the hospital is well-staffed.,
Be vigilant for signs of hospital-acquired MRSA.,
Follow procedure when placing central venous lines.Whether placing the line or caring for it, lax hygiene standards can contaminate the blood and cause infection.,
Take the time to maintain hygiene when handling ventilators.Many patients get MRSA pneumonia while on the ventilator.",How to Get Rid of MRSA4," When patients come into the hospital with MRSA, it is ""community-acquired."" ""Hospital-acquired"" MRSA is when a patient comes in the hospital for treatment of an unrelated condition, then gets MRSA while there. Hospital-acquired MRSA does not usually affect the skin and soft tissues, so you don't often see community-acquired boils and abscesses. These patients progress quickly to more serious complications.


MRSA is a major cause of preventable death and is an epidemic in hospitals across the globe.
The infection spreads quickly from patient to patient via unaware hospital staff who don't follow proper infection control procedures.

, But just as important as wearing gloves in the first place is changing gloves in between patients and washing your hands thoroughly each time you change gloves. If you don't change gloves, you may protect yourself from infection while spreading infection from one patient to the next.


Infection control protocols vary from ward to ward, even within the same hospital. For example, infection is more prevalent in the intensive care unit (ICU), so contact and isolation precautions are usually stricter. Staff may be required to wear protective gowns and facemasks in addition to gloves., Gloves can't be worn at all times, so hand washing is the first line of defense against spreading bacteria.

, Everyone in a crowded hospital setting is both a potential risk and potentially at risk. The test for MRSA is a simple nasal swab that can be analyzed within 15 hours. Screening all new admissions — even those who don’t show symptoms of MRSA — can cut down on the spread of infection. For example, one study showed that about 1/4 of preoperative patients who did not have any symptoms of MRSA were still carrying the bacteria.Screening all patients may not be reasonable within your hospital’s time and budget limits. You might consider screening all surgery patients or those whose fluids staff have to come into contact with.
If the patient is found to have MRSA, the staff can decide on a “decolonization” strategy to prevent contamination during the surgery/procedure and transmission to other people in the health care setting., If single bed rooms are available, suspected MRSA patients should be isolated there. If that's not possible, MRSA patients should, at the very least, be quarantined into the same area, separate from the uninfected population.

, When shifts are understaffed, overworked staff can ""burn out"" and lose focus.A well-rested nurse is more likely to follow infection control protocols carefully, thus reducing the risk of MRSA spreading through a hospital.

, In hospital settings, patients don't usually have the early abscess symptom. Patients with central venous lines are especially vulnerable to MRSA sepsis, and those on ventilators are at risk of MRSA pneumonia.Both are potentially lethal. MRSA can also appear as a bone infection after knee or hip replacement, or as complication from surgery or wound infection.These can also lead to potentially lethal septic shock.

, Blood infections can go to the heart and get lodged on the heart valves. This causes ""endocarditis,"" in which a large chunk of infectious material takes hold. This is extremely deadly.


Treatment for endocarditis is surgical excision of the heart valve and a six week course of IV antibiotics to sterilize the blood.

, When the staff is inserting or manipulating the breathing tube that goes down the trachea, bacteria can be introduced. In emergency situations, staff may not find the time to properly wash their hands, but you should always make an effort to observe this important step. If there's not time to wash your hands, at least put on a pair of sterile gloves.

Seek treatment early.,
Understand the common treatment methods.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions.",How to Treat Toe Nail Fungus1," It is important to treat the condition as early as possible. This will ensure that the condition is easier to treat, reduce the likelihood of recurrence, and help ensure that you do not need to have the nail removed. This is important: the infection will not go away on its own and home remedies are rarely effective.;
, There are a number of different treatment methods and which your doctor prescribes will depend largely on the state of your infection and other circumstances.Understand that most of these methods take weeks to show improvement and that you will have to be fastidious about following the regimen recommended by your doctor.


Topical medications may be prescribed in certain cases. These are creams and lotions which you will apply as your doctor sees fit. Disinfect nails and apply Canesten cream twice daily, for as many months it takes. It is a slow treat, but effective.
Oral medications are also commonly used to fight fungal infections. There are a variety of drugs available but many can cause health complications for those with certain health conditions, so be sure that your doctor is aware of your medical history.
Antifungal lacquer is occasionally used to combat these infections. Placed on the nail like nail polish, this can be an easy way to solve the problem but requires a prescription.

, Again, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions, as a lapse in treatment can cause the infection to come back or worsen. You should also consult with your doctor before combining different treatment methods.

Look for symptoms of bacterial vaginosis (BV).,
Pay attention to signs of a yeast infection (candidiasis).,
Look for signs of a trichomoniasis infection (trich).,
Consider the cause of your bacterial infection.,
Know when to get medical attention.,
Get a physical examination.,
Learn how to handle recurring infections.,
Take medication.,
Avoid douching.,
Eat yogurt.,
Know when to go back to the doctor.,
Keep the area clean.,
Avoid fragrances and irritants.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Wear non-irritating underwear.",How to Cure Vaginal Infection," If you suspect you have a vaginal infection, pay attention to your symptoms. Not all women with BV have symptoms, but the following symptoms are often associated with BV:Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant or ""fishy"" odor
Yellowish discharge
Burning or discomfort when urinating
Itchiness and irritation in and around the vagina;
, The symptoms of a yeast infection are similar to BV. They include:Abnormal vaginal discharge which can range from a thin, watery, white discharge to a thick, white, and chunky discharge (often described as looking like cottage cheese)
Itching and burning of the vagina and labia
Painful intercourse
Painful urination
Redness and swelling of the area just outside of the vagina.

, While many people with a trich infection have no symptoms, these symptoms are signs of an infection:Vaginal discharge that is smelly, frothy, bubbly, or foamy
Vaginal itching
Yellow or gray-green discharge
Painful urination

, There is not always a specific cause for BV or a yeast infection other than a bacterial imbalance. Trich is an STI that is caused by a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. Most women have probably had at least one bacterial infection.


The risk of getting BV increases with a new sexual partner (or multiple partners), douching, having sex without a condom, or using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a method of birth control.If you are diagnosed with trichomoniasis, you'll need to inform any sexual partners so they can be treated.
Yeast infections and BV can be caused by antibiotic use. Antibiotics disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in your vagina which can allow ""bad"" bacteria or yeast to thrive.
Other causes may include: wearing tight underwear or non-cotton panties (which can increase the temperature around the vagina and increase the moisture levels), a weakened immune system, using vaginal douches or perfumed feminine hygiene sprays, or vaginal trauma (scratches in the vagina caused by inserting objects like tampons or during rough sex).
You should also tell any sexual partner about any vaginal infection, but you aren't required to.

, Since different infections often have similar symptoms, it's critical that your doctor make a diagnosis so you get the correct treatment. See your doctor if you have any symptoms of a vaginal infection. Your doctor will prescribe a course of treatment, but if you don't notice an improvement after three days, have a fever, if the discharge symptoms worsen, or a new rash appears anywhere on your body contact your doctor.Keep in mind that recurrent yeast infections can be a sign of a more serious underlying disorder such as diabetes, cancer or HIV-AIDs. Recurrent yeast infections might suggest there's a problem with your immune system.

, At the doctor’s office, your physician will probably take a sample of the vaginal discharge, ask for a urine sample and perform a vaginal exam. This exam may be uncomfortable but it is usually over quickly. The discharge will be tested for the presence of bacteria, yeast or other organisms such as Trichomonas.


Your doctor will also ask about your sexual history, menstruation, vaginal hygiene, and any medications you're taking., Since different types of vaginal infections are treated differently, it's critical to get the correct diagnosis from a doctor before you start any treatment. Usually, after your first vaginal infection, you'll be able to tell when you have an infection, but it's still important to find out the type of infection.


Untreated or incorrectly treated bacterial infections can cause complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pre-term births and low-birth weight babies and can put a woman at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), chlamydia and gonorrhea.Untreated or incorrectly treated trichomoniasis infections can also lead to increased risk of HIV., Your doctor will recommend a course of treatment once your vaginal infection is diagnosed. Treatment will depend on the type of infection, how extensive or severe it is and how long you have had the infection. These are typical treatments for:


Bacterial Vaginosis: Antibiotics like metronidazole or clindamycin. These are considered safe if you are pregnant.Male partners usually don’t need treatment, but female partners should be informed and tested.Yeast Infection: Antifungal creams, ointments, oral dose of fluconazole, or vaginal suppositories.Examples of these treatments are butoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole and terconazole. Your doctor can prescribe them or they are available (in weaker doses) over-the-counter at your pharmacy.
Recurrent or more complicated yeast infections: Higher doses of medications used to treat yeast infections or you may be told to take them for a longer period of time. Since your partner may be the source of your recurring yeast infections, your partner may need to be treated as well.Trichomoniasis: A single dose of either metronidazole or tinidazole. These antibiotics are also considered safe if you are pregnant. Trichomoniasis is an STI, so make sure your sexual partner(s) are treated as well. You should wait for 7 days after treatment before you resume sexual activities., Douching is the procedure of washing or cleaning out the inside of the vagina with water or other fluids. Douching isn't recommended because the vagina naturally cleans itself and douching can increase the risk of bacterial infections.


Douching can actually introduce bacteria, causing vaginal infections and other serious infections like pelvic inflammatory disease. There are no known methods to reduce your risk of infection from douching., If you have recurrent bacterial infections, consider getting probiotics through yogurt. Probiotics can be effective in preventing future infections. Eat 150 grams of yogurt that has 4 to 5 billion Colony Forming Units (CFU) every day. Make sure to read the label for this information.


While more research is needed, some studies suggest that bacterial cultures in yogurt or probiotic supplements can populate the vagina.Do not insert yogurt into your vagina.

, Contact your doctor if your symptoms don't improve, if you develop a fever, have difficulty or pain when you urinate, have painful sex, or experience abdominal pain.You should always inform your doctor when using natural treatments.
Usually, you can take oral medications while using the natural treatments.

, Use a very mild soap and warm water to wash your genital area. Dry yourself with a clean towel or air dry. You can also try drying the area with a blow dryer set on cool.


Avoid bubble baths, bath oils, talc, or powder (especially powder which contains cornstarch). These can irritate the area and provide food for infection-causing microorganisms., Use a mild and fragrance-free soap for washing your panties. It's a good idea to double rinse your underwear. This ensures that all the detergent is gone. Do not use fabric softeners or dryer sheets since they contain chemicals that may irritate your vagina.


Don't use feminine hygiene products, which can irritate the vulva. These include deodorant sanitary pads, all feminine sprays and deodorants, any products containing petroleum jelly, oils or greases., After using the restroom, use white, soft toilet tissue and remember to wipe from the front. This minimizes the risk of infection from bowel bacteria. If you use tampons during the day, replace them every few hours depending on your flow and avoid using tampons with fragrance.Do not leave tampons in overnight. Use sanitary pads instead.

, Choose white, 100 percent-cotton underwear. Cotton allows your genital area to stay cool and dry.The white underwear avoids irritants that may be in different dyes. Avoid underwear made with nylon, acetate or any synthetic fibers. You should also avoid wearing thong underwear which can irritate the genital area.


Once you feel comfortable with the volume of your discharge, consider sleeping without underwear. This can be especially helpful for if you get recurrent BV.
Avoid scratching or rubbing your genitals.
Avoid wearing pantyhose. These trap heat and moisture which can allow bacteria, yeast and other organisms to thrive. Instead, wear nylons with a cotton panty insert.

Recognize the symptoms of scarlet fever.It usually affects people who have strep throat, as it's caused by the same Streptococcus bacteria.,
Seek immediate medical attention.Although scarlet fever itself is generally a mild illness, if left untreated it can result in rheumatic fever.,
Get a medical diagnosis.The doctor will perform a physical exam in which he examines the throat, tonsils, and tongue.,
Take the prescribed antibiotics.Because scarlet fever is a bacterial infection, it responds well to antibiotic treatment.,
Be prepared for the side effects of antibiotics.About one in ten people experience side effects from antibiotics.,
Watch for signs of improvement.",How to Cure Scarlet Fever1," In rare cases, it may be caused by streptococcal skin infections. Anyone can contract scarlet fever, but it occurs primarily in children under age ten. Especially in children, look for the following symptoms of scarlet fever:


Red, sore throat
Fever
Red rash that feels like sandpaper
Bright red skin in underarm, elbow and groin creases
A whitish coating on the tongue or back of the throat
A ""strawberry"" red tongue
Headache
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal pain
Swollen glands
Body aches;
, Rheumatic fever is a serious condition that can cause inflammation of the heart, joints, and nervous system. Other complications that sometimes arise from scarlet fever include:


Kidney disease
Ear and skin infections
Abscesses in the throat
Pneumonia
Arthritis

, He'll also feel the neck to check for enlarged lymph nodes and examines the rash. To confirm the diagnosis, he will take a throat swab and have it analyzed for the presence of the strep bacteria.

, These medications should be taken precisely as prescribed to ensure successful treatment. Though not all of these medications will be prescribed, the doctor will recommend whichever combination will best treat your specific case:


Amoxicillin: three 30 – 50 mg/kg doses per day for ten days.
Augmentin: 30 – 50 mg /kg/day in divided doses given every 12 hours for ten days.
Biaxin: an alternative for patients allergic to Penicillin antibiotics like Amoxicillin and Augmentin. 250 mg is taken orally every 12 hours for ten days. It is available in liquid form for children in doses of 250 mg/5cc.
Zithromax or Azithromycin: 500 mg orally on day one and 250 mg daily on days two through five.
Keflex: 500 mg four times daily for ten days for adults or children over 12. It's available in liquid form for children in doses of 25 – 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses.

, Luckily, these effects are usually fairly mild, and pass whenever you've completed treatment. In most cases, side effects affect the digestive system:


Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Bloating and indigestion
Stomach pain
Loss of appetite

, Within two days of starting antibiotics, you should see an improvement in symptoms like sore throat and fever. You should feel more energetic and begin regaining your appetite. The rash will last a little longer, and will heal over several days or weeks. As it heals, the skin will peel off — this is perfectly normal, so don't panic!Let your doctor know if you’re not responding on schedule. It may suggest further complications that need to be addressed.

Allow air to reach the infected toe as much as possible.,
Avoid wearing tight shoes.,
Dry feet thoroughly after getting wet.",How to Treat Toe Nail Fungus2," Moist socks and shoes breed fungal growth. Go barefooted as much as you can. Wear sandals whenever possible. Do not wear your sock or hosiery more than one day without washing. White socks that can be bleached are a plus.

, Tight shoes push your toes together, potentially transferring fungus and often creating the perfect moist, warm and closed environment so beloved by fungus. If you like wearing heels, it might be a good idea to take a break from them if they're bunching up your toes. It can also help to shift to wearing only shoes that ""breathe"". Tight hosiery can cause similar problems.

, After bathing, swimming and any activity that leaves your feet sweaty or wet, dry them thoroughly. This will help keep the infection from worsening. Be especially careful of public pools and similar opportunities to spread your infection. Avoid these places or find ways to keep your feet covered.

Understand the importance of medical treatment.,
Remove excess nail.,
Use Vick’s VapoRub(TM), or a generic brand.,
Use water and vinegar.,
Use essential oils.",How to Treat Toe Nail Fungus3," Nail fungal infections are incredibly complicated to treatand can take a great deal of time to heal completely. If treated incorrectly, they can easily come back. Please see a doctor about your infection but in the meantime or during treatment, you may be able to use certain supplemental treatments to minimize pain and aid the healing process. Consult with your doctor to ensure that these treatments do not conflict with the medication they have prescribed.

, For toenails that have advanced fungus underneath that is growing and lifting the nail up off its bed, soak the foot (or feet) with any affected toes for 20-30 minutes in warm water. Then, begin trimming the nail. You will be surprised to find that your nail is no longer attached to your toe in the places where the fungus has invaded beneath the nail––this is normal even if worrying. Simply cut away all of this unattached nail and scrape off the thick, flaky fungus matter. Remove as much of the abnormal looking stuff as possible. Push the cuticles back. It is vital from this point on to be consistent in your care.


Never tear off toenails with your fingers. Always use a clean nail clipper or long-handled nail scissors. Trimming after bathing is often the best time, as the nails are at their softest.
If there is any pain involved, do not do this yourself. See your doctor or podiatrist. Proper removal can help to ensure the regrowth of a healthy nail rather than a deformed one.

, Keep ""Vapor Rub"" salve by your bedside and apply a small amount to affected toe and toenails before donning socks. Be sure that the toes are dry before applying the Vick's to avoid sealing moisture in under the rub. This method takes a while, but so do commercial applications and this one is both cheap and reliable.

, Soak your toes in a weak solution of water and vinegar for at least half an hour on a nightly basis. This lowers the pH of your toenails so that the fungus can no longer survive. You need to do this regularly, every night, for three to six months. While this is quite a commitment, it works.

, Applying a liquid remedy faithfully, both morning and night of every day until the toenails strengthen, can be a good, natural way of curing your toenail fungus. You may buy a remedy at the pharmacy, but many people have had great success with 100% pure tea-tree oil––or use 5% to 10% of pure orange oil (not orange oil cleaner) in a mix of 50% vinegar and 50% rubbing alcohol. Shake well before each use. Apply this with a medicine dropper. Make sure it seeps down into the exposed nail bed and under the sides and edges of the nail. As the nail grows, keep removing dead tissue to leave a healthy environment for the new nail.

Call your doctor.",How to Avoid Listeria," Raw dairy products, like milk or cheese, are more available in supermarkets and farmers markets. Although these foods may taste good, they can also be a source of the Listeria bacteria.Avoiding these foods can help minimize your risk of contracting this bacteria.


A study by the FDA showed that consuming raw or unpasteurized dairy products are 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness (from bacteria like listeria) and 13 times more likely to cause hospitalization compared to pasteurized dairy products.
Dairy products like milk or cheese are the most common raw and unpasteurized products that you may come across. They have not gone through the process of pasteurization which helps kill off harmful bacteria.
In addition to Listeria, raw dairy products can also contain both the Salmonella and E.Coli bacterium as well.
Only consume pasteurized milk and cheese. Avoid raw milk, raw cheese or fresh cheeses as these may be sources of Listeria.;
, Like raw dairy products, another very common source of Listeria is deli meat and pre-prepared meat salads (like chicken or tuna salad). Limiting your consumption of these foods or changing the way you prepare them can help you avoid contamination with Listeria.Deli meats, hot dogs and pre-prepared meat salads can contain Listeria because this bacteria can grow even at colder temperatures. Also avoid pâté and other meat spreads that are in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.
In addition, deli meat is typically never reheated prior to eating. Only heating foods to a proper temperature of at least 160°F (71.1°C) can kill Listeria bacteria.If you want to eat deli meat, microwave it or cook it in a pan until a thermometer says the internal temperature is 160°F (71.1°C).
However, it's difficult to reheat items like tuna or chicken salad, so it may be best to avoid these foods altogether — especially if you're part of an at risk population (like an elderly person or a pregnant woman).
If you're purchasing foods like deli meat or hot dogs, store unopened packages for no longer than two weeks and store opened packages no more than three to five days., A more uncommon source of Listeria is smoked and refrigerated seafood. Although this might not be a frequent part of your diet, items like lox or smoked trout can contain Listeria.Limit or avoid any seafood with labeling that says any of the following: smoked, kippered, nova-style, lox, or jerky. These types of seafood are the ones that would contain Listeria.
You will typically find this type of fish or seafood in the refrigerated section of the grocery store (many times near the seafood counter).
Note that canned seafood (like canned tuna or salmon) is OK to eat and will not contain Listeria bacteria since it's been processed at high temperatures where that bacteria would be killed off.

, Although Listeria typically is not found on or in fresh produce, there has been several outbreaks of Listeria that have stemmed from melons (like cantaloupe melon).Be very careful and use proper sanitation techniques when eating melons.


Contamination of Listeria on melons is generally linked to unsanitary handling and storing practices on the behalf of the farmer and/or processing facility.It's only the outside of a whole melon that can be contaminated; however, when you cut through a melon, you drag the bacteria from the outside of the melon into the flesh of the melon with your knife.
To avoid eating contaminated melons make sure you wash your hands for 20 seconds with hot soapy water before and after preparing your melon.
Also scrub the outside of the melon with warm soapy water using a produce brush. Dry the melon well and then cut and serve. Don't forget to wash and sanitize the produce brush after each melon or between uses.
Keep cut melon in the refrigerator in an airtight container for no more than seven days.

, In addition to being mindful about the types of foods that could contain Listeria, it's also important to make sure you do not contaminate yourself with dirty hands.Wash them appropriately to decrease your risk of self or cross contamination.


The best method of hand washing is by using soap and water. Although alcohol based cleanser do kill bacteria, soap and water has always been the most recommended by health professionals.
Using warm water, lather your hands and wrists well with soap. Scrub your fingers, palms and backs of your hands for at least 20 seconds (about the time it'll take you to say your ABC's).
Rinse well and then dry your hands using a paper towel. Do not use a dish cloth to dry your hands as there might be germs or bacteria that can recontaminate your freshly washed hands.

, Although there has been recent news suggesting you may be able to consume foods past their ""use by"" dates, it's not advised by health professionals. Do not consume foods that have expired as these foods may contain Listeria among other harmful bacteria.A ""use by"" date is listed on all packaged goods. It may be difficult to locate, but look on the top, bottom and sides of packaging to locate this information. This is a date recommended by the food manufacturer that signifies the last date the food will be of peak quality.
Regarding Listeria specifically, always follow the ""use by"" date on all foods, but specifically look for dates on deli meat, pre-prepared meat salads or pate, hot dogs and smoked seafood.
Throw out or do not consume any foods that are past the ""use by"" date. This is especially important to follow if you have a compromised immune system, are pregnant, are elderly or have are feeding a young child.

, It's important to also store food appropriately and safely in your refrigerator to help prevent the cross contamination of foods and to help prevent the growth of Listeria bacteria. Be very mindful of where and how you store your foods.



Listeria is a particularly dangerous type of bacteria not only due to the severe symptoms and side effects, but also because it can grow well in cold temperatures that some refrigerators may be set at.To start, make sure your refrigerator is set at the correct temperature. It should be set at 40°F (4.4°C). Foods that are held above 40°F (4.4°C) for more than two hours should not be consumed.
Be mindful of where you place foods in the refrigerator as well. Raw meat, poultry or seafood should be stored in a sealed container on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator and underneath any fresh produce.
Do not store perishable foods (like milk) on the door of the refrigerator. The temperature fluctuates greatly as you open and close the door. Keep more stable items, like condiments and butter, on the door.
If you notice any spills (especially from meat products), clean them up immediately with a bleach-based cleaner or antiseptic-grade cleaner.

, Even if you have foods that do not contain Listeria, if you mishandle them during preparation and cooking, you could contaminate the foods and yourself.Be careful to make sure you practice safe handling and preparation methods.


To start food preparation, make sure you're using clean knives, utensils, bowls and cutting boards. If you're unsure, wash and sanitize them prior to use. Also only use one cutting board for raw meat (you may want to color code this).
Cook all meat to the appropriate temperatures and make sure to measure the temperature with a thermometer. This helps kill any harmful bacteria.
Beef should be cooked to 160°F (71.1°C), poultry should be cooked to 165°F (173.9°C), pork, ham and seafood should be cooked to 145°F (62.8°C), and all leftovers or casseroles should be heated until they reach 165°F (173.9°C).If you're preparing a meal with multiple dishes with different types of foods, make sure to use fresh, clean and sanitized cutlery, cutting boards and dishes with each item. For example, do not cut raw chicken with the same knife you're using to cut lettuce. You'll need to wash and sanitize the knife in between uses.

, When you're getting ready to prepare a meal or serve yourself a meal, think about what foods you have in your refrigerator. To avoid food waste and spoilage, try to eat the pre-cooked or leftover foods first.Health professionals recommend that you consume all pre-cooked or pre-made items within three to four days of purchase or from when they were originally made.
After this time period, you increase your risk of eating spoiled or contaminated foods which could cause foodborne illnesses like listeriosis.
This also goes for leftovers. These should be consumed within three to four days of when they were originally made. Store in the refrigerator in a container with an airtight lid (avoid just covering with plastic wrap or foil).

, If you've accidentally consumed a food that was contaminated with the Listeria bacteria, you may start to exhibit a variety of symptoms. It's important to track these symptoms so you can receive the proper care.


Before noting exactly what symptoms you're experiencing, take a note of the time you started to notice them. Has it been 12 hours since your last meal? Did symptoms occur within 60 minutes of eating a meal or snack? Symptoms from Listeria typically don't appear until a few days have passed since eating the contaminated food.The first signs of a possible listeriosis infection include: fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and nausea. You may have general GI upset as well.
If left untreated, the Listeria bacteria can travel to your nervous system as well. Signs include: headache, stiff neck, loss of balance, confusion and convulsions.
If you think you've eaten food contaminated with Listeria and are experiencing symptoms, track the symptoms, their duration, their start date and severity. Provide this information to your doctor.

, Whenever you think you've eaten a food that has caused you to become sick, it's important to try to figure out which food could have made you sick. This way you can throw it out or warn others.


If you think you have listeriosis, note that symptoms typically start a few days after ingesting the contaminated food. You'll need to do a food recall for about one week in order to be accurate.
Write down every meal and snack that you can remember consuming for the past week. This will be difficult so asking others you ate with can help you form an accurate food recall.
Make sure to pay particular attention to any foods that you ate at a restaurant and foods that are known to be carries for Listeria (like deli meat, raw dairy products or hot dogs).
If you can, star foods that you think may have caused your illness and make sure to discard them immediately.

, With any illness, it's important to stay properly hydrated. This is especially important if you are experiencing any GI symptoms like diarrhea. Drink adequate fluids to help prevent further symptoms or aggravation of listeriosis.


Even if you haven't spoken to your doctor yet, if you feel you're experiencing symptoms of listeriosis, start drinking clear, hydrating fluids.
Aim for a minimum of eight 8-ounce glasses (about 2 liters) of fluids daily. But when you're sick, you may need up to 13 glasses (3 liters). Stick with fluids like water, flavored water, sparkling water, and decaf coffee or tea.
If you cannot keep up with your fluids, you're at an increased risk to become dehydrated. If symptoms become severe enough, your doctor might give you IV fluids to restore proper hydration., To make sure a possible Listeria infection doesn't become severe, it's important to talk to and see your doctor immediately. If you are experiencing symptoms and think you could have consumed contaminated food, call your physician immediately.


If you've done a food journal or recall, make sure to bring that with you to your doctors office. Let them review it to see if they can identify the food that could have caused your illness.
Listeria outbreaks are reported to public health officials and carefully monitored. It is important to be aware of these outbreaks in your community if you are in a high risk population. Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Foodborne Outbreak Online Database.
Bring a list of your symptoms and their onset. This can help your doctor determine what type of bacteria might be causing your illness as well.
Diagnosis of listeriosis can only be confirmed by a blood culture, not stool, like some other illnesses. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, you might be put on antibiotics as a precaution until the cultures come back negative.
If you're pregnant and you think you may have eaten a food contaminated with Listeria or are experiencing symptoms of listeriosis, call your OB/GYN immediately.

Look for cold-like symptoms early on.,
Check for a fever.,
Look for Koplik's spots inside the mouth.,
Watch for a rash that spreads from the head downwards.,
Check for inflamed eyes.,
Contact a doctor immediately if you or someone you know has measles.,
Avoid direct contact with others if you have measles.,
Get measles vaccinations for anyone in your family that has not had one.,
Don't believe harmful myths about measles vaccines.",How to Diagnose Measles," One of the most frustrating aspects of the measles virus for parents and caretakers is that, at first, it often appears to be nothing serious. For about one to five days before the telltale rash appears, measles usually causes symptoms like those of a cold or flu. These early symptoms usually arise anywhere from 7–21 days after exposure to an infected person:Sore throat
Hacking cough
Sneezing
Runny nose
Swollen lymph nodes
More rarely, diarrhea
General malaise

Note: A person with measles can still spread the disease during this early stage.;
, Measles usually causes a fairly high fever that can peak around 104°F (40°C).This fever can appear before or during the full-body rash that measles is most famous for. Usually, the fever goes away at about the same time the rash does — however, this may not be the case for all measles patients.

, A few days after the initial cold-like symptoms begin, small red spots called Koplik's spots will usually develop on the insides of the cheeks. These spots will have a small white or bluish-white center, making them look like grains of sand, and will often be closely clustered around the areas where the molars touch the cheeks.These spots will persist on their own for a few days before the full-body rash develops. If you notice these spots on yourself or someone else, it is important to take action fast, since these spots indicate that the disease is, in fact, measles, but that it has not yet reached its most contagious stage. See Part 2 below for more information.

, Within about five days of the initial symptoms, the well-known measles rash appears. This rash usually begins on the forehead, spreads to the rest of the face, and then progresses rapidly down the chest and back, eventually covering the whole body. The rash takes the form of raised, flat red bumps or blotches. Within a few days, the rash should begin to slough off, starting with where it first appeared.


At this point, the measles patient is at his or her most infectious. Quarantine at this stage is crucial, as the infectiousness will usually last for about four days after the rash begins., The measles rash can sometimes be accompanied by conjunctivitis, a condition of the eyes.Often, conjunctivitis arises when the facial rash is especially bad. This uncomfortable condition can cause symptoms similar to pink eye, including:


Inflammation
Pink/red appearance
Watering
Discharge
Eyes sealing shut during sleep

, Because measles is highly contagious, it is important to notify your doctor as soon as you suspect you (or someone you know) has it. Although measles is not responsive to antibiotics, your doctor still needs to diagnose your disease, monitor your symptoms, and may even need to treat secondary infections caused by the virus. Most treatment for measles itself is supportive — that is, it's designed to keep your symptoms manageable so that you can get better naturally



Don't show up unannounced at your doctor's office with a case of the measles. Always phone ahead. Because measles is so contagious, your doctor may not want measles patients to be near the other patients, especially if they are very young or their immune systems are weakened. Your doctor may, for instance, advise you to use a separate entrance or to wear a mask into the office.

, Measles is very, very contagious. About 90% of un-vaccinated people who are around someone with measles will get the disease.While it's not typically a life-threatening disease for healthy people, it can pose serious problems for people in at-risk groups, like the very young, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. Thus, to protect these people, it is very important to do everything you can to prevent others from getting the disease.


Staying at home except for medical visits is a must — be sure to contact your work or school to notify them of the situation. Remember that the disease usually stops being contagious about four days after the rash appears. You may want to give yourself an extra day or two of ""safety time"" on top of this.
If you are forced to interact with others, you may want to put on a surgical mask: measles is spread when tiny droplets of moisture expelled from sneezes or coughs are inhaled by another person.

, If you or someone in your family has measles or has recently been around someone who has had measles, you may be safe if you have been vaccinated or you can get vaccinated quickly. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is very effective at preventing new cases of measles — in fact, after two doses of the vaccine, 95% of people will have immunity to the virus.In some rare cases, it is still possible to get the virus after being vaccinated, but in these cases, the virus tends to be less severe and less contagious.


Immunity against measles is usually for life — that is, once you have either received the vaccine or had the illness, you won't be able to get it again.

Note: People who were vaccinated before 1968 may still be vulnerable to measles, as early vaccines were not as long-lasting as they are today., Measles vaccines have unfortunately become the source of controversy, leading some parents to keep their children from receiving them. While this may be well-intentioned, neglecting to vaccinate a child against measles can have serious consequences. See below for a few misconceptions about the measles vaccine:


The measles vaccine has been linked to autism: False — a single scientific study in the 80s which suggested this possibility has since been discredited.The measles virus itself, however, can very rarely leave children brain-damaged.The measles vaccine is dangerous for healthy people: False — the measles vaccine has the same mild side effects as any other vaccine. In very rare cases, more serious symptoms may occur, but these are less dangerous than the virus itself.
The effects of the measles vaccine are not well-understood: False — the measles vaccine has been rigorously studied and tested.
The best way for a child to get a measles immunity is to recover from the disease naturally: False — measles can rarely have serious complications, including death, while the vaccine has none. In addition, this ""natural"" approach puts the lives of immune-compromised individuals in the community at risk.
To be clear: The best way to protect a healthy person (and the rest of the community) from measles is with the MMR vaccine.

Know the symptoms of osteoarthritis.,

Wear a knee brace.,
Talk to a doctor about surgery.,
Make sure you have the correct diagnosis.,
Manage your weight.,
Exercise.,
Try a combination of ice and heat packs.Both have been shown to help people diminish the pain that is often associated with knee crepitus.,
Cautiously consider dietary supplements.",How to Treat Crepitus in the Knee," Unlike the ""normal"" popping sound that can come from stretching, which is painless, knee crepitus from arthritis is often quite painful. Luckily, there are several ways to detect osteoarthritis:Look for signs of pain, redness, swelling and stiffness while walking. The most common location of crepitus from arthritis is in the inner part of the knee.
Feel for the presence of crepitus by placing one hand on top of the knee while flexing and extending the joint. Usually, crepitus results in a soft yet crunchy sensation.;
, If the crepitus is accompanied by pain and signs of inflammation, apply ice packs (wrapped in a towel) to the area. Ice packs help decrease the swelling of the inflamed area and ease the associated pain.


You may also take small amounts of over-the-counter NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as Advil (Ibuprofen) or Naproxen (Aleve) for quick pain relief. However, don't rely on these drugs for long-term pain relief, as they can affect the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.
The benefit of NSAIDs (which are anti-inflammatory medications) is that they not only diminish pain, but also reduce inflammation.
You may combine an NSAID with an over-the-counter painkiller such as Tylenol (Acetaminophen). This does not diminish inflammation, but it can definitely help to diminish the pain, and the two medications in concert (an NSAID and Tylenol) can be extremely effective and helpful at getting you through your day-to-day activities pain-free.

, Prescription NSAIDs include Indocin, Daypro, Relafen, and a variety of other drugs.Prescription-strength anti-inflammatory drugs are stronger-acting than over-the-counter varieties and may prove more effective at fighting the pain and inflammation associated with knee crepitus. However, these stronger drugs require permission from a doctor, which usually means your knee crepitus will need to be clinically examined by one.


Prescription NSAIDs can have side effects - most commonly, stomach irritation, but in severe cases (and in cases of overdose), stomach ulcers and kidney damage are possible.Always take medicine as directed, and not more than your doctor recommends.

, Cortisone is a steroid hormone that is naturally produced by the body in response to stress. (Note: it is not the type of steroid used — and sometimes abused — by athletes and bodybuilders.) It suppresses the body's immune system, greatly reducing inflammation. For cases of painful knee crepitus, doctors may choose to inject cortisone directly into the knee joint to reduce pain and inflammation.


Cortisone injections have proven useful as a treatment for periodic ""flare-ups"" of knee crepitus. However, frequent, repeated injections into the joint can actually cause cartilage to deteriorate, worsening crepitus-associated pain. For this reason, cortisone injections aren't suitable as a long-term form of treatment.Cortisone injections are not recommended more than once every three months, but they can be used for as long as they are effective, which can be several years in certain cases.

, Something called ""synovial fluid"" within the knee joint is used to lubricate and stabilize motion of the joint. In some patients with osteoarthritis, the synovial fluid becomes ""thinner"" - in other words, less viscous. This can lead to extra friction and abnormal joint movement. In this case, your doctor may recommend ""viscosupplementation"" — a procedure that involves injecting new fluid into your knee joint to strengthen and lubricate your knee joint.


Usually, this treatment takes place as a series of three to five injections over the course of several weeks.
Note that, of patients who undergo ""viscosupplementation,"" about half find relief from their symptoms., Special medical braces are sometimes given to patients with arthritis in the knee. These braces shift the weight off of the inside portion of the knee, where crepitus is most common.Knee braces can also stabilize and support the knee joint, ensuring it bends in a healthy way and protecting it from further damage or irritation.


While over-the-counter knee braces are commercially available for cheap prices, most medical-quality knee braces need to be custom-made to fit your joint and can therefore be more expensive. Talk to your doctor for pricing information if you're interested in a knee brace.

, In severe cases of knee crepitus associated with arthritis, surgery may be an option. If your quality of life has seriously deteriorated due to knee pain and you've already tried non-surgical treatments, consider talking to your doctor about options for knee surgery.


There are several types of knee surgery that your doctor may recommend: Total or partial knee replacement, cartilage repair, knee arthroscopy, and knee osteotomy are common options.Note that knee surgeries that work well for one patient may not work for other patients. Arthritis is notoriously tricky to treat — be sure you discuss all options with your doctor before you make a decision.

, Knee pain can be caused from a few different diagnoses, including osteoarthritis (caused by mechanical ""wear and tear"" on the knee joint over time — the most common cause), rheumatoid arthritis (caused by autoimmune problems), infectious arthritis, old knee injuries, or patellar dysfunction to name a few.It is key to see a doctor to establish the correct diagnosis, because the best treatment and management plan depends specifically on what is going on inside your knee.


Similarly, if you have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, for example, but find that it is not improving with treatments, speak to your doctor about the possibility of investigating other possible diagnoses., Each pound of weight gain puts up to six more pounds of pressure on the knee joint. Thus, overweight people tend to develop arthritis more frequently than those at a healthy weight.To prevent future knee pain (and to lessen symptoms that already exist), try to maintain a healthy weight, primarily through diet (exercise may be limited by the presence of knee pain).


People with arthritis are advised to avoid processed or fried foods, sugars, refined carbohydrates, salt, preservatives, and corn oil, all which may aggravate the inflammation of the joint directly or through weight gain.

, Muscles around the joint act as shock absorbers, helping to support and stabilize the joints both in physically demanding situations (such as during sports and exercise) as well as in your daily activities. The stronger the muscles are, the greater stress they can absorb. To help prevent crepitus (and, if you already have it, to reduce it), gradually build the muscles around your joint through strength exercise.


For knee crepitus, thigh contraction is a great exercise that strengthen muscles around the knee joint. Place a rolled-up towel under your knee and tighten your thigh muscles. Hold it for five seconds and relax and repeat again for 10 times.
Isometric exercises such as straight leg raises ( with the knee locked), quad sets, or wall sits can strengthen the joint while limiting motion through the involved joint. This avoids aggravating the joint and increasing pain and inflammation).
Low-impact cardio exercises such as biking or swimming may also be done (recommended at least three times a week) to improve the muscle strength of the thigh and calf. These exercises can also help you lose weight, further reducing crepitus pain.

, Try experimenting with icing and/or heat to see if it works for you.

, Certain nutritional supplements, including glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are used by some arthritis sufferers to treat and/or prevent crepitus.However, these supplements are not regulated by the FDA and have not yet been scientifically proven to work. There is also little information on any side effects from long-term use of these supplements. Clinical studies are underway to evaluate these supplements for medical use. In the meantime, talk to your doctor or someone you trust who has tried these dietary supplements before beginning to take them.

Eat soft foods in small amounts.Scarlet fever often causes vomiting, so large meals are not recommended.,
Manage the fever with over-the-counter medications.Begin by taking Tylenol every four hours.,
Increase your vitamin C intake.,
Take care not to spread the infection.",How to Cure Scarlet Fever2," Studies show that sleep deprivation suppresses the immune system and makes it harder to fight infection. Adequate rest allows the immune system to function properly and respond to infection.The infection will wear you out, so you'll likely want to rest anyway. Even if you have other obligations, put them on the back burner until you've allowed your body to heal.

, Between the fever, pain response, frequent swallowing, and vomiting, dehydration is common with scarlet fever. Water is crucial to your body's ability to function properly, and when you're sick it needs water even more.You may not be able to keep down large amounts of water, so take frequent sips throughout the day.

, Because your throat will be sore, you should stick to small amounts of soft foods. The main goal is to prevent further vomiting. If vomiting becomes a problem, ask your doctor to prescribe an anti-nausea drug like zofran or phenergan. Examples of soft foods that will help prevent vomiting include:


Gelatin
Soups or broths
Juice
Pedia-pops
Puddings
Rice
Applesauce

, If fever lingers, add Motrin (100/5 cc) every 6 hours. This may also help with the headache and throat pain. To cool your body, wear loose fitting, short garments that will not retain body heat.


Monitor children's temperatures closely, as high fever in children can lead to febrile seizures.Seek immediate medical attention if the child suffers a febrile seizure.

, Studies have shown that vitamin C enhance immune function and helps the body fight off infection.You can drink your vitamin C In the form of fresh orange juice or other citrus products, or take a supplement. The recommended supplement dose for adults is 500 mg taken orally once a day for the duration of the illness. Dosage for children will depend on weight and other factors. Consult your doctor for his recommendations.

, Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Infections commonly spread within families, so it may be a good idea to isolate yourself until you've healed. The infection is not spread through shared linens or other objects.It's spread through direct contact or contact with body fluids, so practice excellent hygiene for the duration of the illness:


Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing .
Dispose of all tissues immediately.
Wash your hands regularly.
If you're caring for someone else with scarlet fever, be careful. Avoid contact with oral or nasal secretions. Take care not to touch your own mouth or nose until you've washed your hands.

Do not cut the nail.,
Do not dig under the nail.,
Do not attempt to drain an infection.,
Do not cut a ‘V’ in the nail.,
Avoid coating your toe.",How to Remove Infection from an Ingrown Toenail," In order to reduce the pain and swelling involved with an ingrown toenail, soak the foot with the ingrown toenail for 10-20 minutes in warm, soapy water, three times a day for one to two weeks.The Epsom salt can also help with pain and inflammation. Fill a tub with warm water and add 1-2 tablespoons of Epsom salts. Place your foot into the water, and relax while it soaks. When finished soaking, dry your toe completely.
You can do this multiple times a day if the pain gets too much for you.
Never soak your foot in hot water. It should always be soaked in warm water.;
, To relieve the pressure under the ingrown edge of the toenail, doctors sometimes suggest propping the nail up slightly. This is done by sticking a small piece of cotton or thick floss under the edge of the nail. This technique helps pull the nail away from the skin, so it no longer digs into the skin.


If you use cotton, you can dip it in antiseptic to help ease the pain and prevent infection under the nail.If the nail is infected, this may also help to soak up any moisture that is trapped under the nail.
If you use thick floss, make sure that it is unflavored and unwaxed.
Do not insert a metal tool under the nail to try to insert cotton or floss. This could damage the toe further., Antibacterial ointment is helpful when dealing with an infected ingrown toenail. Before you apply the ointment, dry your toe completely. Cover the infected area with an antibacterial cream. Apply the ointments in a thick coat over the infected area of the toe. Wrap your toe with a bandage such as a large band-aid. This prevents debris from entering the wound and keeps the ointment in place.


Use antibacterial ointments such as Neosporin., Ingrown toenails that become infected should not be treated at home, which is true for most infected wounds. Visit a podiatrist, more commonly known as a foot doctor, to get treatment for your infection. If the infection and nail are bad enough, minor surgery may be required. For the most part, however, a simple surgical procedure involving numbing the nail bed and then removing part of the ingrown nail with clippers or scissors by the doctor,


You may be prescribed oral antibiotics, which are taken by mouth, to help fend off further infections.If you are prescribed antibiotics, make sure you complete the entire course and follow up with your doctor as needed.

, A common misconception about having an infected ingrown toenail is that it needs to be cut. Contrary to popular belief, cutting the nail can make the infection worse. It can also cause more ingrown toenails in the future. Leave the nail uncut, and prop it up to relieve pressure.


The toenail may need to be cut by a doctor, but should not be done at home in ‘bathroom surgery’., It may be tempting to try to relieve pressure or lift the nail from the skin by digging at the skin underneath. Do not do this because it can intensify an infection and make the ingrown nail worse.


Stay away from your toenails with tweezers, orange sticks, clippers, files, or any other metal tools., There is a popular conception that you should use a needle to puncture a blister or a pustule caused by an infection. You should not do this because it will just make it worse. Even if you use clean tools and a sanitized needle, you can cause some serious damage by poking and prodding at a blister or infected wound.


Avoid touching it with anything other than a cotton swab or bandaging materials., According to some old folk healing methods, you should cut a ‘V’ shape in the top of the infected toenail to relieve the pressure, which in turn will heal the nail. However, doing this does absolutely nothing except create a jagged edge on your nail., Do not believe urban health myths such as rubbing coal on your toe to make an infection go away. Although some people swear by this method, the coal won’t benefit the infection or the ingrown nail at all. In fact, this method may make it worse. In general, you should not put anything on your toe or the infected area except for antibiotic cream or bandages."

Practice good sleep hygiene by establishing a cool, quiet and comfortable sleeping environment.Establish a sleep schedule. Go to bed and rise at the same time each day — try not to sleep in on the weekends.;
, Caffeine and alcohol (ethanol) both disrupt sleep and should be avoided if you have RLS.Alcohol can make you drowsy, but it prevents you from getting a deep and restful sleep. Caffeine causes greater brain activity and more thoughts, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.


Caffeine is found in coffee, black tea, green tea, colas, other soda pop, energy drinks and chocolate.
Try caffeine-free sodas or flavored, carbonated water if you want something fizzy to drink.
Have a non-alcoholic beer if you have RLS and have trouble sleeping.

, RLS is felt in the legs and typically described as uncontrollable twitching, tingling, creeping, pulling and/or achy pain that's triggered by resting.Exercising your legs in the afternoon or early evening may relieve some of the restlessness in the muscles and nerves and help you get to sleep easier.Go for a walk in your neighborhood, ride your bike, take swimming lessons or try the stair climber at your local gym.
Although mild-to-moderate exercise may relieve symptoms of RLS, overdoing it during the day or working out too late in the evening may actually make things worse.
Just prior to bedtime (or if you can't sleep during the night), walk around your bedroom for a few minutes shaking your legs — it can temporarily relieve uncomfortable sensations.

, Although RLS is not entirely a muscle problem — it's also related to an imbalance in brain chemistry and nerve flow — treating your leg muscles can give short-term relief.So in addition to exercising your legs, stretching them on a daily basis (ideally at the beginning and end of each day) can help prevent the muscles from getting tight and feeling restless and/or crampy during the night.


To stretch the back of your legs, bend over at the waist and try to touch your toes. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds without ""bouncing.""
To stretch the front of your legs, balance yourself against a wall and bend the knee of one leg so that your heel touches your buttocks. Hold for 30 seconds and then do the other leg.
To stretch the calf muscles, hold a towel in both hands and wrap it around your foot while sitting or lying on your back. Pull the towel towards your head, while feeling a stretch in the calf muscle as you pull the toes up towards your head. Hold this position for at least 30 seconds. Repeat three to five times.
Before stretching any muscle, make sure that it's not cold or painful. Wait until your legs feel warmed up by walking around the house for a few minutes.

, Another simple approach that can help relax muscles is taking a warm bath in the evenings, just prior to bedtime.The warm water hydrates the tissues and improves circulation, which can trigger tight muscles to relax. Soak in the tub for about 20 minutes and then start getting ready for bed soon thereafter.


Adding Epsom salt to your bath may help soothe tightness and achiness because it's rich in magnesium — a mineral muscles need to stop contracting and relax.
Don't run your salty bath water too hot, because the combination of hot water and salt can draw water out of your body and potentially make symptoms of RLS worse. Also, don't stay in the bath for too long for the same reason.

, Using the same logic as taking a warm bath, placing warm packs or bags on your legs prior to bedtime may relax the muscles and reduce RLS symptoms.Buy a few small herbal bags infused with lavender or other relaxing essential oils, or a rice heating pack, and zap them in the microwave for a few minutes before applying them to your legs. Allow them to soothe your legs for 15 minutes or so while you read or watch a relaxing movie.


Conversely, applying cool packs might have a benefit also, although don't apply ice packs because they can cause your legs to shiver and get worse.
If it's warm in your room, apply cool and moist towels to your legs for relaxation.

, Dehydration from not drinking enough water is not a primary cause of RLS, but it can certainty make existing symptoms much worse. Muscle cramping and twitching, especially in the legs, is a common symptom of dehydration. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water daily, or even more if you're exercising or playing sports, or spending time outdoors on hot or humid days. Avoid caffeinated beverages because they stimulate urination and can promote dehydration.


Other good sources of hydration include fresh fruit and veggie juices, herbal teas and low fat milk. Almond and rice milk are healthy non-dairy options.
Other symptoms of dehydration to look out for are fatigue, headache, extreme thirst, dry mouth, dry skin, confusion and irritability., Another strategy that can help soothe your muscles and relieve the symptoms of RLS are relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga or deep breathing.Muscle tissue is sensitive to physical and emotional stress, so learning how to relax is helpful for RLS symptoms.


Your can practice relaxation techniques throughout the day, but they may be most effective for RLS is you do them just before bedtime.
Ask your doctor, chiropractor or massage therapist about a referral to a yoga instructor or meditation practitioner.

, Restless leg syndrome can have many causes, including genetic and environmental causes. You speak to your doctor about RLS so she can rule out any potentially underlying causes, from an iron deficiency to kidney disease. RLS may potentially be associated with cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes, migraine and Parkinson’s disease., When RLS symptoms become severe and significantly disrupt sleep, your doctor may prescribe medications. The preferred prescribed drugs are dopamine agonists, which replace the neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain — dopamine levels are usually too low in people with RLS.Dopamine agonists are also used to combat Parkinson's disease because they reduce the urge to move restless and twitching muscles.
Commonly used dopamine agonists include ropinirole (Requip), pramipexole (Mirapex), as well as the rotigotine patch (Neupro).

, Medications that can control seizures and normally used to combat epilepsy are also used to treat severe RLS symptoms because they can slow down or block the pain signals in the nerves that feed the muscles of the legs.These drugs don't cure RLS, but can offer short-term relief by affecting the calcium channels within nerves.


The only FDA-approved anti-seizure drug for RLS is gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), although gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) may also be effective.
Anti-seizure drugs can also make you drowsy, which can help you get a restful sleep at night.

, Sleeping medications, particularly ones called benzodiazepines, can help promote sleep at night and sometimes act as muscle relaxants, but they don't usually eliminate the annoying and sometimes painful leg sensations.Commonly used benzodiazepines for RLS include clonazepam (Klonopin), eszopiclone (Lunesta), temazepam (Restoril), zaleplon (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien).Sedatives such as benzodiazepines and other sleeping medications are usually reserved for more severe cases RLS because they tend to be very addictive and cause significant daytime drowsiness.

, Opioids are strong narcotic drugs that can relieve severe symptoms of pain, cramping and restlessness associated with RLS, but they can be addictive, especially if taken in larger doses.Commonly prescribed opioids include codeine, oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone), oxycodone w/ acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet), and hydrocodone w/ acetaminophen (Norco).


If your RLS symptoms are mild or moderate, it's best to try other medications or remedies first.

, Some medications can make the symptoms of RLS worse, so they should be avoided, or dosages reduced under the supervision of your doctor. These include some antidepressants, antipsychotic medications, anti-nausea pills and cold and allergy remedies.Ask you doctor which ones are most problematic.


If you need to take any of these drugs due to another condition, then your doctor may recommend adding drugs to help combat RLS symptoms.

, Many people with RLS have low levels of iron in their system, which is called anemia.A lack of iron reduces the body's capacity to deliver oxygen to cells, which makes you feel very tired and causes muscles to act up and become symptomatic. Get a blood test to see if you're deficient in iron and ask your doctor if you're a good candidate for iron supplements.


Since iron deficiency is a potentially reversible cause of RLS, many sleep specialists recommend over-the-counter (OTC) supplements that contain ferrous sulfate.Iron dosages typically range from 10-30mg daily, although don't exceed the upper tolerable limits of 45mg. Ask your doctor what is appropriate for you.
While taking iron supplements, monitor your body's iron levels via regular blood tests.
Foods that are naturally high in iron include: red meat (especially beef liver), pork, poultry, most seafood, beans, spinach and dried fruit.

, Magnesium deficiency is a growing concern in the U.S. due to mineral depletion of soil and dietary shifts away from eating fresh veggies (and legumes) and more towards fast food. Some of the side effects of magnesium deficiency include RLS, sleep disorders (insomnia), muscle spasm and weakness.Experimenting with a magnesium supplement for a few weeks or so and seeing how it impacts your RLS is inexpensive and very safe.


Typical doses of magnesium citrate supplements range from 300-500mg daily.
It's a good idea to take a B-vitamin complex also because vitamin B6 helps with magnesium absorption in your body.
Foods that are rich in magnesium include: beans and legumes, most nuts, whole grains, and most green leafy vegetables.

, RLS is not really caused by muscle strains, pulls or tightness, which are all common reasons to get a professional deep-tissue massage. However, regularly massaging the muscles of your restless legs, particularly your calves and feet, may alleviate RLS symptoms for short periods of time.Start with a 30-minute massage for your legs three times per week and see if it makes a positive difference.


Your health insurance policy may cover professional massage if your doctor prescribes it for medical benefit.
If you can't afford massage therapy, ask your spouse, partner, friend, or a family member for a leg rub. Watch education videos online to learn the basics.
Always drink lots of water after massaging muscles in order to flush out toxins that may make your feel sore or nauseous.

, Research shows that 65% of people with restless leg syndrome use alternative therapies to conventional medical treatments.Using acupuncture, Chinese herbal therapy and near infrared light therapy are some of the treatments being sought. However, there is little current evidence that they can be of benefit. Further high quality studies may be warranted to evaluate whether any of these alternative therapies can be of benefit."

Don’t let your toe get worse.",How to Relieve Ingrown Toe Nail Pain1," An ingrown toenail will usually cause a small amount of swelling in the area next to your toenail. Compare your toe to the same toe on your other foot. Does it look puffier than normal?;
, The skin around the toenail will feel tender, or painful when touched or pressed. Gently press your finger along the area to isolate where the discomfort is coming from or just take a nail clipper and cut off the nail.


An ingrown toenail might also have a small amount of pus.

, With an ingrown toenail, the skin alongside the edge of the nail appears to grow over the nail. Or, the nail might look like it’s growing underneath the skin alongside the nail. You might not be able to locate the top corner of the nail., Most of the time, an ingrown toenail can be treated at home successfully. But if you have diabetes or another condition that causes neuropathy, or nerve damage, you should not try treating an ingrown toenail by yourself. You should make an appointment with your doctor immediately.If you have nerve damage or poor blood circulation in your leg or foot, your doctor will want to check out your ingrown toenail right away., If you’re not sure if you have an ingrown toenail, it’s best to see your doctor. She will be able to diagnose the toenail and give you recommendations for treating it.


If the condition is particularly bad, your physician may recommend seeing a podiatrist, or foot specialist.

Use padding whenever possible.",How to Treat Bursitis," Bursitis is when a bursa sac becomes enlarged and inflamed. A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that provides cushioning for your body near your joints.That is, it provides padding as your bones, skin, and tissues connect and move with your joints., Symptoms of bursitis include swelling at the site, as well as pain. The area may also be red or have stiffness. If you have these symptoms, you should see your doctor., Your doctor will use questions and a physical exam to diagnose the condition. She may also order an MRI or an X-ray. , Bursitis is most often caused by repeated motions in the same joint or by lightly hitting the same area over time. For instance, activities such as gardening, painting, playing tennis, or playing golf can all lead to bursitis if you are not careful.Other causes of bursitis are infection, trauma or injury, arthritis, or gout.

, ""PRICEM"" stands for ""protect,"" ""rest,"" ""ice,"" ""compress,"" ""elevate,"" and ""medicate.""Provide protection by padding the joint, especially if it's in the lower half of your body. For instance, wear knee pads if your bursitis is in your knees, and you need to continue kneeling.Give your joint as much of a break as possible by staying off of it. For instance, try different exercises that don't hurt the area near the joint that is inflamed.Use ice packs wrapped in a cloth. You can also use frozen vegetables such as peas. Ice the area for 20 minutes at a time, and you can use this method up to 4 times a day.You can wrap the joint in an elastic bandage to provide support. Also, be sure to raise the area above your heart as often as possible. Otherwise, blood and fluid may collect in the area.Use anti-inflammatory pain pills, such as ibuprofen, which can help decrease the swelling and pain., Apply heat to the area for up to 20 minutes four times a day.You can use a hot pad or a hot water bottle. If you don't have either of those, dampen a washcloth, and place it in the microwave. Heat for 30 seconds or so to warm it, making sure it's not too hot., Though you may not like using a cane or walker, you may need one while you recover. These devices help take some of the weight off the bursa area, allowing it to heal faster, as well as reducing your pain., Splints and braces provide support to injured areas. In the case of bursitis, they can provide some much-needed relief for your joint areas, leading to quicker healing.However, only use braces or splints for the initial burst of pain. If you use them too long, it decreases strength in that joint. Talk to your doctor about how long you should wear one., This type of injection is one of the main medical treatments for bursitis. Essentially, your doctor will use a needle to inject cortisone into the joint.If you're worried about the pain, most doctors use an anesthetic first to numb the area. He or she may also use an ultrasound to help guide the needle to the right place.These injections should help both the inflammation and the pain, though it may become worse before it gets better., Sometimes, the inflammation is caused by an infection. A round of antibiotics can help your body fight off the infection, reducing the inflammation and the bursitis.If the bursa is infected, your doctor may drain the infected fluid first with a needle.

, Physical therapy may be a good option for you, especially if you have frequent flare-ups. A physical therapist can show you how to best exercise to improve your range of motion and pain level, as well as how to help prevent the problem in the future., Water can help you move the joint easier without as much pain, so that you can slowly regain motion.However, be gentle in your swimming. Swimming can lead to bursitis in the shoulder, so keep the intensity down. Focus on recovering motion and lessening pain not on an intense workout.


Another option is water physical therapy, which allows you to improve your pain under the direction of a professional., A surgeon can surgically remove the bursa if it becomes a severe problem, but this treatment is usually the last one a doctor will recommend., That is, bursitis is often caused by you using the same joint to do the same movement over and over, such as doing too many push-ups or even something as small as typing for too long., If you do have to do an action for a long period of time, be sure to rest from time to time. For instance, if you have been writing or typing for a long period of time, take a few minutes to stretch your hands and arms., A physical therapist can help you with exercises and stretches for your specific needs. Before you exercise, take the time to do some stretches and some light movements to warm up your body.For instance, start with something simple like doing jumping jacksor jogging in place.You can also try stretches such as high knee pulls, where you lift your arms up in the air. Pull them back down as you pull one knee up. Alternate knees.Another easy warm up is high kicks, which is exactly how it sounds; kick one leg high in the air in front of you. Switch back and forth between legs., When you first start a new exercise or weight-lifting routine, take time to build up stamina. You don't want to jump into doing a hundred repetitions your first time out. Start small, and build up each day.For instance, the first day you do push-ups, maybe you want to just try doing ten or so. The next day, add one more. Keeping adding one everyday until you reach a level you are comfortable with.

, You should expect some strain on your muscles if you're lifting weights or starting a new exercise. However, you should stop if you feel any sharp or severe pain, which can indicate a problem., Sit and stand up straight when you can. Pull your shoulders back. If you notice yourself slouching, correct your posture. Bad posture can lead to bursitis, especially in your shoulders.When you are standing, place your feet evenly, about shoulder-width apart. Keep your shoulders back. Don't tense up. Keep your gut in. Your arms should hang freely.When you are sitting, your knees should be in line with your hips. Keep your feet flat. Don't tense up your shoulders, but do roll them back. Make sure your back is supported by the chair. If it isn't, you may need to add a small pillow near the base of your back. Imagine a string down your spine, pulling your head up as you sit., If one of your legs is longer than the other, that can lead to bursitis in one of your joints.Use a shoe lift for the shorter leg to correct the problem.An orthopedic doctor can help you get the right type of lift. Essentially, a heel or shoe lift is incorporated into the bottom of the shoe. It lengthens that leg a bit, since it provides added height., That is, when you're sitting, make sure you have a cushion under you. When you're kneeling, have a knee pad under you. Pick good shoes that offer proper support and padding, such as high quality walking sneakers."

Know your risk factors.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,

Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Avoid taking high-estrogen birth control pills.,
Stay out of the sun.",How to Prevent Varicose Veins1," Some people are more prone to developing varicose veins than others. Knowing the risk factors for developing varicose veins will help you choose healthy lifestyle habits. If you have several risk factors, it’s a good idea to consult with your doctor about how to manage your risk.



Age. Age is a significant factor in whether you may develop varicose veins. Aging causes your veins to lose some of their elasticity. The valves inside your veins stop functioning as efficiently. This can cause varicose veins to develop.Biological sex. Women are more likely to develop varicose veins. This may be because of the hormonal changes female bodies usually experience, such as menopause and pregnancy.Genetics. If a member of your immediate family has varicose veins, you may be at greater risk for developing them as well.If you were born with weaker vein valves, you are at higher risk of developing varicose veins.

Obesity. Being overweight can put a lot of extra pressure on your veins. This can lead to developing varicose veins.Lack of movement. If you stand or sit still for long stretches of time, you may be at greater risk for developing varicose veins. Staying in position for too long puts extra pressure on your veins to pump blood to your heart.Leg trauma. If you have had previous trauma or injuries, such as blood clots, you are at higher risk for developing varicose veins.;
, Excess weight will put undue pressure on your legs and circulatory system. If you are overweight, losing weight will reduce this pressure, thereby reducing your risk of varicose veins., Avoid foods with high calorie and low nutrition content. Eat a diet that’s high in fiber. Some studies suggest a relationship between low-fiber diets and the development of varicose veins.Diets high in fiber also help lower your cholesterol and may reduce blood pressure.Avoid added salt when possible. Reducing your salt intake can help reduce swelling in varicose veins. It may also reduce your body’s water retention., Walking and jogging improve circulation in the legs, and proper circulation helps ward off the development and worsening of varicose veins. Exercise also reduces overall high blood pressure and strengthens your entire circulatory system.


Running is also helpful in preventing the appearance of varicose veins. It improves circulation in your legs., Smoking contributes to many health problems. Studies have shown that the high blood pressure associated with smoking also helps cause varicose veins. Smoking is also associated with “lower limb venous insufficiency,” where blood does not flow properly and pools into the legs., Long-term use of birth control pills containing high levels of estrogen and progesterone may increase your risk of developing varicose veins. Hormone replacement therapy may have similar effects. Talk with your doctor about the best option for you.


Prolonged use of estrogen and progesterone may weaken the valves in your veins and alter circulation in your legs.Birth control that uses lower doses of estrogen is less likely to result in varicose veins or blood clots., In fair-complexioned people, excessive sun exposure can cause spider veins. Exposure to the sun also poses risks such as the possibility of developing skin cancer.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you always wear sunscreen when outdoors. Stay out of the sun during midday, when the sun is highest."

Bandage your toe to protect it.,
Wear open-toe sandals or loose shoes.,
Try homeopathic remedies.",How to Relieve Ingrown Toe Nail Pain2," Use a large bowl or your bathtub to soak your foot. This will help reduce swelling and tenderness. Soak it for about 15 minutes. Repeat 3-4 times per day.Add Epsom salts to the water. Epsom salts are widely recognized for their ability to reduce pain and swelling. These will also help soften the toenail. Add 1 cup of Epsom salts to a bathtub filled with a few inches of water or a foot bath.
If you don't have Epsom salts, you can use plain salt. Salt water will help reduce the growth of bacteria in the area.
Gently massage the affected area. This will help water soak into the ingrown toenail, which will help clear out bacteria and may relieve swelling and pain.

, After you soak your foot, the toenail should be softened. Carefully work a piece of clean dental floss under the edge of your nail. Lift up the edge of the toenail gently so that it does not grow further into your skin.Try this approach after every foot soak. Use a clean length of floss each time.
Depending on the extent of your ingrown toenail, this might be a little painful. Try taking a pain reliever to ease your discomfort.
Don’t dig too much into your toenail. You can cause more infection, which may require medical intervention.

, An over-the-counter pain reliever can give you some relief from the discomfort you’re experiencing. Try a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. NSAIDs can help relieve pain and inflammation.If you cannot take NSAIDs, try acetaminophen instead.

, An antibiotic cream will help fight off infection. This type of cream is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores.Antibiotic creams also can have topical anesthetic such as lidocaine. This will temporarily relieve the pain in the area.
Follow application instructions on the cream’s package.

, To protect your toe from getting further infected or caught on your sock, wrap a bandage or bit of gauze around your toe.

, Give your feet some extra room by choosing to wear open-toe shoes, sandals or other loose-fitting shoes.Tightly fitting shoes can cause or exacerbate an ingrown toenail.

, Homeopathy is alternative medicine that relies on herbs and other natural ingredients to treat various ailments.To treat ingrown toenail pain, try one or more of the following homeopathic remedies:


Silicea Terra, Teucrium, Nitric Acid, Graphites, Magnetis Polus Australis, Phosphoric Acid, Thuja, Causticum, Natrum Mur, Alumina, or Kali Carb."

Repeat the process daily.",How to Relieve Ingrown Toe Nail Pain3," Using warm water and Epsom salts, give your affected toenail a good soak for 15 minutes. This will help soften the nail, making it easier for you to pull it away from the skin.

, Gently pull away the skin alongside your toenail. This will help separate the skin from the nail so that you can see the edge of the nail. Use a piece of floss or a pointed file to lift the edge of the toenail away from the skin. You might need to start with the side of the toenail that is not ingrown. Work the floss or file toward the ingrown edge.Make sure to disinfect the file with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide before you use it.

, While you have the nail lifted away from the skin, pour a small amount of clean water, rubbing alcohol, or other disinfectant underneath the nail. This will prevent bacteria from collecting there.

, Take a small amount of clean gauze and stuff it underneath the lifted nail. The point here is to keep the nail edge from touching the skin. Then it can grow away from the skin, rather than becoming more ingrown., Once you have gauze in place, dab the area with an antibiotic cream. You can choose an ointment with lidocaine, which will slightly numb the area.

, Wrap a strip of gauze around your toe. Or, you can use a bandage or a toe sock, which is a single toe covering designed to keep one toe separate from the others., Use this process to help heal an ingrown toenail. As the toe heals, the pain from the ingrown toenail will subside, and the swelling will go down.


Be sure to change the gauze daily to ensure that bacteria is not introduced into the toenail area.

If you have diabetes or another condition that causes nerve damage, see your doctor immediately and consider seeing a podiatrist.If you notice red streaks coming from the toe, you need to see a doctor immediately. This is a sign of a major infection.
You should also see a doctor if there is pus present near the toenail., Your doctor will ask you when the ingrown toenail started, and when it started to swell or get red or painful. He or she will also likely ask you if you are feeling any other symptoms, such as fever. Be sure to talk about your symptoms fully.Your general practitioner is usually able to treat an ingrown toenail. But for more complicated cases or recurrent conditions, you might choose to see a podiatrist (foot specialist)., If your toenail is infected, your doctor may prescribe an oral or topical antibiotic. This will ensure that the infection clears up and new bacteria does not take root under the toenail.

, Your doctor will likely want to try the least invasive procedure, which is to lift the toenail slightly away from the skin. If she can get the toenail edge away from the skin, she may pack gauze or cotton underneath.Your doctor will give you instructions for replacing the gauze every day. Follow these instructions to make sure your toenail heals.

, If the ingrown toenail is very infected or has grown significantly into the surrounding skin, your doctor might opt to remove part of the nail. Your doctor will administer a local anesthetic. Then the doctor will cut along the nail edge to remove the part of the nail growing into the skin.Your toenail will regrow in 2-4 months. Some patients worry about the look of the toenail after this procedure. But if your toenail has been growing into your skin, chances are it will look better after this partial removal.
Toenail removal may sound drastic, but it actually relieves the pressure, irritation, and pain of an ingrown nail.

, When you get repeated ingrown toenails, you might want to look into a more permanent solution. In this procedure, the doctor will remove some of your nail, along with the nail bed underneath this section. This will prevent the nail from growing back in this area.This procedure is administered by laser, chemical, electrical current or other surgery."

Wear compression stockings.",How to Prevent Varicose Veins2," Standing in one place for a long time increases venous pressure in the legs and feet. Over time, this pressure weakens the blood vessel walls. This will worsen existing varicose veins and could contribute to the development of new ones.Since prolonged standing is almost unavoidable in some jobs, mitigate the harm by shifting your position as frequently as possible. Try to walk around at least every 30 minutes.

, Sit up straight and don’t cross your legs. Good posture improves circulation, while crossed legs may restrict blood flow to and from the legs.Avoid sitting for long stretches of time without taking a break. Get up every half-hour or so to stretch or walk around.

, Relaxing and “putting your feet up” can help reduce your risk of developing varicose veins.Try to raise your legs above your heart for 15 minutes, 3-4 times per day.This will help improve circulation and reduce pressure.


When possible, keep your legs elevated when sitting or sleeping.Other options include using an inversion table or elevating the foot of your bed so that your feet are slightly higher than your head when you sleep. Consult with your doctor before trying these methods.

, Improve circulation to your lower body by avoiding tight-fitting clothes. Be especially careful to avoid tight fits around your waist, legs, and groin area. Tight clothing can make existing varicose veins worse, and may increase your risk of developing them.Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes instead of high heels. Low-heeled shoes can help tone your calves, which will help your blood move easily through your veins.Make sure your shoes are properly fitted to avoid pinching or tightness., If you’re developing varicose veins, try regularly using compression stockings or hose. These can be purchased at medical supply stores or pharmacies and come in a variety of different compressions. Consult with your doctor before buying or wearing compression stockings.Use a tape measure to measure your legs so that you get the right size. Compression stockings should provide firm compression, but shouldn’t necessarily feel tight.If you will be flying for a long trip, discuss getting compression hose with your medical adviser. These can help reduce strain on your legs and may be helpful for preventing the worsening of existing varicose veins.

Recognize the symptoms of varicose veins.,
Know when to seek medical help.,
Consider other treatment options.",How to Prevent Varicose Veins3," Varicose veins don’t usually cause serious health problems. However, they can cause discomfort, pain, and embarrassment. You may want your doctor to help you manage your varicose veins, even if they don’t pose a health hazard. Common symptoms of varicose veins include:


Aches and pain in the legs
Throbbing or cramping
Feelings of heaviness or swelling in the legs
Itchy, irritated, or darkened skin
Fidgety or restless legs

, While most varicose veins do not pose a serious health threat, sometimes they can lead to issues you should seek medical help for. If you have varicose veins and experience any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:Sudden swelling of the leg
Redness or warmth around the vein
Change in skin thickness or color
Bleeding on or around a varicose vein
Tender lump in your leg
Open sores or ulcers

, If your at-home changes do not help your varicose veins, you may want to consider other treatments. Consult with your doctor about your options.Sclerotherapy. This is the most common treatment for varicose veins. Sclerotherapy involves injecting chemicals into the varicose vein, which causes it to swell and then seal shut. After a few weeks, the vein turns into scar tissue and then fades. This procedure can usually be done right in your doctor’s office.

Laser surgery. This is a less common technique, because not all skin types and colors can be treated safely this way. It is also usually not effective for veins larger than 3 millimeters (1/10 of an inch).

Endovenous techniques. These treatments are designed for deeper or severe varicose veins. They are usually done under local anesthesia in your doctor’s office.

Surgery. Surgeries are usually reserved to treat very large or very severe varicose veins. Consult with your doctor to consider whether surgical treatments are right for you.

Wear shoes that have a wide toe box.,
Buy shoes that fit your feet properly.,
Put orthotics in your shoes.",How to Relieve Bunions1," You can relieve the pressure on your bunions by wearing shoes that have a wide, flexible sole that supports your feet. There should also be enough room in the toe box, or the part surrounding the front of your foot, to fit the bunion without it rubbing against the shoe. Shoes like sandals, athletic shoes, and soft leather shoes are all ideal as they will provide support and space for your bunions.If you wear heels, you should try to keep your heels low, no higher than an inch off the ground. Your shoes should also have a sturdy heel counter so the heel of your shoes are snug and stay in place when you walk.
Avoid narrow shoes or slip on shoes as they will not provide the support and space your need to walk comfortably with your bunions.
If you have shoes that you find comfortable but cannot wear due to your bunions, you may be able to reshape them to make them less narrow using stretchers in the shoes. However, you should only do this if the shoes support your feet well.;
, Do not believe the myth that your feet do not grow once you reach adulthood. In fact, your feet can get bigger and wider as the ligaments loosen and your arches flatten over time. When you are buying new shoes, you should ask a sales associate to make sure the shoes are not too narrow for your feet. They can measure your feet and help you find the right size so your new shoes do not agitate your bunion further.You can also make sure the shoes fit properly by walking around in them in the store to ensure they do not pinch or squeeze your toes. There should be ample room in the toe box or front area of the shoe for your bunions.

, Orthotics can be placed inside your shoes to help realign the bones in your feet. They can also reduce the amount of pressure on your bunions, which can make your bunions less painful. You can buy orthotics over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.You can also get prescription orthotics from your primary care doctor or from a podiatrist. Prescription orthotics are custom made for your feet so they will be fit your feet properly and provide the type of support you need.
Keep in mind orthotics are usually a short term solution to bunions and feet pain. You may need to have your bunions surgically removed if they continue to be painful and make it difficult for you to walk.

Change your routine or take a break from it.,
Change your shoes or boots.,
Try stretching your shin muscles.,
Use a supportive bandage.,
Apply ice or frozen gel packs.,
Take an Epsom salt bath.",How to Prevent Shin Splints1," If you feel shin pain coming on frequently due to your jogging, dancing or workout routine, then consider altering it somehow by doing fewer repetitions, using lower weights or changing your running circuit.For example, refrain from running up hills or on hard surfaces, or stop doing leg presses at the gym for a while and see how your symptoms respond — consult with a personal trainer if need be. If your leg problem is work related, then talk to your boss about switching to a more sedentary activity for a few days and allowing your lower leg muscles to rest and recuperate.


Recognizing a musculoskeletal injury in its early phase and allowing it time to heal by resting is the best way to prevent acute injuries from progressing or becoming chronic (long term).
Occupations that increase the risk of shin splints include forest rangers, field engineers, firemen, military recruits, certain referees (such as soccer or basketball), roofers and some types of construction jobs.;
, Shoes and boots that don't provide arch support and/or ones that are relatively heavy are a risk factor for developing shin splints.Poor arch support allows your feet to over-pronate (collapse inwards), which puts stress on your tibia and knee. If they make your feet too heavy, then they can strain the tibialis anterior muscle, which is responsible for lifting your foot when you walk or run. As such, look for well fitting, lightweight shoes and boots with good arch support and flexible soles if you want to prevent shin splints.


Avoid ""negative heel"" shoes or sandals that orientate the foot such that the heel sits lower than the forefoot — they put too much strain on the shin muscles. Instead, pick shoes and boots that are elevated in the heel by about 1/4 or 1/2 inch.
If you're a serious runner, replace your shoes every 350–500 miles or after three months, whichever comes first.

, Stretching the affected area of your lower leg might stop the pain or discomfort from progressing, especially if you address the problem during its initial stages.Use slow, steady movements and remember to breathe deeply during your stretches. For the anterior tibialis muscle, the key is plantar flexing the foot, which means pointing your toes and contracting the arch of your foot. Try the fencing stance, with your affected leg outstretched behind you and your toenails touching the floor. Put pressure down on the top of your foot and feel the stretch in the front of your shin.


In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat five to 10 times daily until the shin pain fades away.
Stretching directly after the application of moist heat might help because your shin muscles will be more pliable.

, If you feel some tightness or discomfort developing in your shin during exercise, then in addition to scaling back your intensity, consider wrapping the area below your knee with a supportive Tensor or Ace bandage or even a neoprene sleeve. Elastic bandages and neoprene sleeves provide support and warmth to the shin muscles, and may help bind the tendons up against the tibia to prevent stress and strain.Keep wrapping your lower leg until the tenderness disappears, which usually takes three to six weeks.
Tensor or Ace bandages and neoprene sleeves are inexpensive and widely available in drugstores.

, The application of cold therapy is an effective treatment for essentially all strain-type injuries, including shin splints, because it reduces inflammation and dulls pain.If your shin muscles flare-up after physical activity, then apply ice to the most tender area for about 15–20 minutes every two to three hours until the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your shin with a bandage or elastic support is even more efficient for controlling inflammation.


Always wrap ice cubes or frozen gel packs in a thin towel to prevent frostbite on your skin.
If you don't have ice cubes or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of peas or corn from the freezer.

, Soaking your legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce the achy pain and swelling associated with mild-to-moderate muscle strain.The magnesium component in the Epsom salt helps the muscles relax and pull inflammation out of the tissues.


Alternatively, you can apply moist heat to your shin if you're unable to soak your legs — microwaved herbal bags work well and are sometimes infused with essential oils that have relaxing properties.
If inflammation is a particular problem in your lower leg and it doesn't abate with a salt bath, then follow up with cold therapy until your shin gets numb (15-20 minutes).

Your doctor will examine your toe and foot, ask questions about how you injured it, and maybe even take X-rays in order to determine the extent of the injury and type of fracture. However, your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training for serious problems with your toe.


The most common symptoms of a broken toe include intense pain, swelling, stiffness and usually bruising due to some internal bleeding. Walking is difficult, and running or jumping nearly impossible without excruciating pain.
Other types of healthcare professionals who could help diagnose and/or treat broken toes include osteopaths, podiatrists, chiropractors and physiotherapists, as well as emergency room or urgent care physicians.;
, Small hairline (stress) fractures, bone chips and contusions are not considered serious medical conditions, but severely crushed toes or displaced compound fractures often require surgical intervention, especially if the big toe is involved. Medical specialists such as an orthopedist (bone and joint specialist) or physiatrist (muscle and bone specialist) can better assess the seriousness of your fracture and recommend appropriate treatment. Broken toes can sometimes be related to diseases and conditions that affect and weaken bone, such as bone cancer, bone infections, osteoporosis or complications related to diabetes, so the medical specialists need to consider these when examining your toe.X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your broken toe.
Broken toes are usually the result of dropping something heavy on the foot or ""stubbing"" a toe against something hard and immovable.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis (including the type of fracture) and provide you with various treatment options for your injury, as simple stress fractures can usually be treated at home. In contrast, a mangled, bent, or deformed toe is usually a sign of a more serious fracture and best left to trained professionals.


The smallest toe (5th) and the biggest (1st) are fractured more often than the other toes.Joint dislocations can cause crooked toes also and look similar to fractures, but physical examination and X-rays will distinguish between the two conditions.

, treatment protocol. The most effective treatment protocol for minor musculoskeletal injuries (including stress fractures) is abbreviated R.I.C.E. and stands for rest, ice, compression and elevation. The first step is rest — temporarily stop all activity that involves your injured foot in order to address your injury. Next, cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the broken toe as soon as possible in order to stop any internal bleeding and reduce inflammation, preferably while your leg is elevated on a chair or stack of pillows (which also combats inflammation). Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside over the course of a few days.Compressing the ice against your foot with a compression bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation.


Don't tie the compression bandage too tight or leave it on for more than 15 minutes at a time because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your foot.
Most uncomplicated broken toes heal well, usually within four to six weeks, at which time you can slowly resume athletic activities., Your doctor may recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin, or regular analgesics (painkillers) such as acetaminophen to help combat the inflammation and pain associated with your toe injury.These medications tend to be hard on your stomach, liver and kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken for more than two weeks at a time.

, Tape your broken toe to an adjacent uninjured toe (called buddy taping) for support and to assist realigning it if it's somewhat crooked (speak with your doctor first if your toe appears crooked).Thoroughly clean your toes and feet with alcohol wipes and then use strong medical-grade tape that's preferably waterproof so it can withstand showering. Change the tape every few days over the course of a few weeks.


Consider putting some gauze or felt in between your toes before taping them together in order to prevent skin irritation.
To make a simple, homemade splint for additional support, place trimmed Popsicle sticks on both sides of your toes before taping them together.
If you're unable to tape your own toes, then ask your family doctor, specialist, chiropractor, podiatrist or physical therapist for assistance.

, Immediately after your toe injury, switch to comfortable-fitting shoes that have plenty of room in the toe cap in order to accommodate the swelling and the taping. Choose hard-soled, supportive and sturdy shoes over more trendy types and avoid wearing high heels for at least a few months, because they push your weight forward and severely crowd the toes.Supportive open-toed sandals may be used if the inflammation is excessive, but remember that they don't offer any toe protection.

, If the broken bone fragments don't align together, the orthopedic surgeon will manipulate the pieces back into normal position — a process called reduction.In some cases, reduction can be accomplished without invasive surgery depending on the number and positioning of the bone fragments. A local anesthetic is injected into the toe to numb the pain. If the skin is broken due to the trauma, stitches will be needed to close the wound and topical antiseptics administered.


With open fractures, time is of the essence because of potential blood loss and the risk of infection or necrosis (local tissue death due to lack of oxygen).
Strong painkillers such as narcotics may be prescribed until anesthesia is administered in the operating room.
Sometimes with severe fractures, pins or screws may be required to hold the bones in place while they heal.
Reduction isn’t just used with open compound fractures; it is also used with any fracture with significant displacement.

, After a reduction of your broken toe, a splint is often put in place to support and protect the toe while it heals properly. Alternatively, you may have to wear a supportive compression boot, but either way, you'll likely need the use of crutches over the short term (two weeks or so). At this stage, minimizing walking and resting with your injured foot elevated is still highly recommended.


Although splints provide support and cushioning, they don't provide much protection, so be extra careful not to bump your toe while walking.
During the bone-healing phase, make sure your diet is rich in minerals, especially calcium, magnesium and boron, as well as vitamin D in order to promote bone strength., If more than one toe is broken or other bones of the forefoot are injured (such as the metatarsals), then your doctor might apply a plaster or fiberglass cast to your entire foot. Short-leg walking casts are also recommended if the fragments won't stay snugly together. Most broken bones heal successfully once they have been repositioned and are protected from further trauma or excessive pressure.


Following surgery, and especially with the help of a cast, severely broken toes take six to eight weeks to heal, depending on the location and extent of the injury.After such a long time in a cast, your foot may need some rehabilitation as described below.
After a week or two, your doctor may request another set of X-rays to ensure that the bones are aligned and healing properly.

, If the skin is broken near your injured toe, you are at higher risk of developing an infection within the bone or the surrounding tissues.Infections get swollen, red, warm and very tender to the touch. Sometimes they leak pus (which represents your white blood cells at work) and smell bad. If you experienced an open compound fracture, your doctor may recommend a precautionary two-week course of oral antibiotics to deter the growth and spread of bacteria.


Your doctor will examine the area carefully and prescribe antibiotics if there is an infection.
Your doctor may recommend a tetanus shot following a serious fracture if it was caused by puncturing or lacerating your skin., Orthotics are customized shoe inserts that support the arch of your foot and promote better biomechanics while walking and running.Following a broken toe, especially if the big toe is involved, your gait and foot biomechanics may be negatively altered from limping and avoiding toeing off. Orthotics will help reduce the risk of problems developing in other joints such as the ankle, knee and hips.


With a severe fracture, there's always a risk of arthritis developing in surrounding joints, but orthotics can mitigate the risk.

, After the pain and inflammation have disappeared and the broken bone is healed, you may notice the range of motion or strength within your foot is reduced. As such, ask your doctor for a referral to a sports medicine specialist or physiotherapist who can offer a variety of tailored strengthening exercises, stretches and therapies in order to improve your range of motion, balance, coordination and strength.Other health professionals that may be able to help rehabilitate your toe/foot include podiatrists, osteopaths and chiropractors.

You will probably still be able to walk, but moving around might make the pain worse. The presence of pain does not necessarily mean that the toe is broken, but persistent pain can be an indication of a fracture or break.If putting weight on your toe is excruciatingly painful, you might have a bad break. In this case, you should see a doctor right away. Minor fractures aren't as painful, and may not need medical treatment.
Tingling in addition to pain could indicate a fracture. See a doctor right away.;
, Is it swollen? This is a common indication that you might have a fracture. If you merely stub your toe badly, it will throb for awhile and then the pain will go away without swelling occurring. A fractured toe is very likely to swell.

Place the injured toe near the corresponding healthy toe on your other foot. If the injured toe looks much bigger than the healthy toe, you might have a fracture., When you compare your hurt toe to the corresponding toe on your other foot, does it look misshapen or out of joint? If so, you likely have a severe break and need to see your doctor right away. A minor fracture may not change the shape of a toe.

If you can see that the toe bone has broken through the skin, it's definitely broken, and you should see the doctor immediately.

, If you can feel the bone moving inside, or if any movement in the toe feels odd (in addition to feeling painful!), then it is likely that the toe is broken.

, If the pain, discoloration, and swelling persist for more than a couple of days, you should go to the doctor. You will likely need an X-Ray to verify the break. In many cases the doctor will tell you to stay off your toe and just let it heal. However, some severe breaks may require further medical intervention.

If the pain is so severe that you can't walk on the toe, see your doctor right away.
If the toe looks like it's pointing in the wrong direction or is otherwise badly misshapen, see your doctor right away.
Seek emergency services if the toe is cold or tingling, or it turns blue due to lack of oxygen. , Fill a plastic food storage bag with ice cubes, wrap it in a dishcloth, and place it on the injured toe. Do this in 20 minute increments until you can get to the doctor. The ice will help reduce swelling and stabilize the toe. Keep your foot elevated as much as possible, and don't attempt to walk far on it./images/thumb/1/1e/Know-if-Your-Toe-Is-Broken-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Know-if-Your-Toe-Is-Broken-Step-7-Version-5.jpg

Don't leave the ice in place for more than 20 minutes, as it may damage your skin if you leave it there too long.
You can take an analgesic like ibuprofen or aspirin to ease the pain.

, During your doctor's visit, the doctor will take an X-Ray and then give you instructions for how to care for your toe. In some cases, the doctor will realign the bone. In severe cases, surgery may be needed to place pins or screws in the toe to keep the bones in place.

, Don't do the activity that caused the injury in the first place and avoid other activities that place pressure on your toe. Light walking, swimming, or biking may be fine, but avoid running or playing contact sports for several weeks. Continue resting the toe for the amount of time prescribed by your doctor.

When you're at home, keep your foot elevated to help with swelling.
After several weeks of healing, gradually begin using your toe again, but don't overdo it. If you feel pain or stress, take a step back and rest your foot.

, Most toe fractures and breaks do not require a cast; instead, the doctor will show you how to ""buddy tape"" your broken toe to the toe next to it. This keeps it from wandering out of place and getting reinjured. Ask your doctor or a nurse to show you how to properly change the tape and gauze every few days to keep the area clean.

If you lose feeling in the taped toes or they change in color, the tape is probably too tight. Remove it immediately. Ask your doctor for guidance in reapplying the tape.
Diabetics should not tape their toes. Instead, special flat-footed orthopedic shoes should be worn, as prescribed by your doctor., If your break is severe enough to require a cast, brace, or special walking shoes, you'll probably have to rest it completely for 6 to 8 weeks. Breaks that require surgery may have even longer healing periods. You may need to have several doctor's visits in the meantime to make sure it's healing properly.

See if you’re predisposed to having RLS.,
Get active.,
Wear supportive footwear.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Reduce your caffeine intake.,
Minimize your alcohol intake.,
Quit smoking.,
Try doing mentally stimulating activities.,
Check the side effects of drugs you’re taking.Quite a few drugs can be problematic, including anti-psychotic drugs, anti-nausea drugs, antidepressants that increase serotonin and some cold and allergy medications that contain antihistamines.,
Try taking iron supplements.Note, however, that this must be done with caution, as too much iron can be problematical for the body.,
Talk with your doctor about getting a drug prescription.,
Consider complementary or alternative health techniques.",How to Prevent Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)1," Certain people are more likely to get RLS, either because it runs in their families or because they have a condition that causes RLS to occur. Knowing which RLS risk factors affect you can help you figure out the best way to prevent and lessen the symptoms since you’ll be able to address the cause of your RLS.


Iron-deficiency anemia, varicose veins, diabetes, and lung disease can all cause RLS. If you have one of these conditions, getting appropriate medical treatment may also help to prevent RLS from occurring.Twenty-five percent of pregnant women experience RLS, but it usually goes away at the end of pregnancy. During pregnancy, there are lifestyle changes you can make to prevent or ease the symptoms.
If any of your close family members have had RLS, your chances of having it may be increased. There’s nothing you can do to alter this risk factor, but you can make changes to prevent or lessen the symptoms.
Being overweight or obese can predispose you to RLS more readily. Taking steps to lose weight may help prevent RLS.;
, Those with a sedentary lifestyle seem to be more prone to getting RLS.Include more exercise in your daily routine but start gradually, especially if you've not exercised for a while. The kind of exercise that is most beneficial is anything moderately strenuous, and doing it regularly.Try swimming, cycling, walking fast, running, gym work, yoga, and so on.


Brisk walking four times a week for 30 minutes at a time has been shown to lessen the severity of RLS over a few months.
Intense leg workouts can help. Try a week of daily intense leg exercises lasting around 20 to 30 minutes; cycling or fast walking are excellent choices.
Swimming is a very gentle way to stretch leg muscles, especially if other forms of exercise cause you to cramp when stretching.Exercise not only helps to prevent RLS but can also help to reduce symptoms if they are already present.

, Over time, wearing the wrong types of shoes or walking barefoot can cause your arches to fall. See a foot specialist who will help you to determine if fallen arches are contributing to your RLS. Your foot specialist will be able to recommend actions to take.


You can buy arch inserts at many shoe stores. Wearing these inside your shoes will help to support your arches and can help to relieve your RLS symptoms.
You may find it uncomfortable to walk on hard floors in bare feet; try wearing slippers around the house to soften your landing.

, Keep hydrated and meet your water needs every day. Drinking plenty of water is thought to help to reduce RLS. The amount of water needed to keep you adequately hydrated is dependent on your personal needs and health. As a general rule, drink water every time you get thirsty, and substitute water for coffee, sugary drinks and alcohol as often as possible.

, Caffeine appears to contribute to RLS, so minimizing the level of your daily caffeine intake can be helpful.Caffeine is found principally in coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate, and energy drinks. Avoid any stimulants by way of medication or drugs., Alcohol seems to exacerbate RLS, so try to reduce your intake and don't consume alcohol in the evenings.If you are a woman of any age or a man over 65, then have no more than one drink per day. If you are a man under 65, then have no more than two drinks per day., The risk of RLS seems to be higher for people who smoke. To prevent RLS, eliminate or reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke per day, and cut out any other products that contain nicotine., If you find that your legs bother you during a period of rest (provided it is not bedtime, and you are not trying to sleep), then try doing something that will stimulate your mind.For instance, doing crossword puzzles, reading, writing, or working on the computer can be a way to distract your mind, which can in turn actually alleviate symptoms of RLS and/or prevent them from starting in the first place.

,


If you're taking a medication that lists RLS as a side effect, talk to your doctor about other options.

, It is wise to consult your doctor before trying this approach to ensure that it is a safe option for you.


Low iron (measured as ferritin in the blood) has been shown to be correlated with increased symptoms of RLS. Therefore, for people with low iron levels (as shown on blood tests), taking iron supplements can be helpful in the prevention of symptoms.
However, doctors do not advise to take iron supplements by symptoms alone, without first getting a blood test confirming low values, as it can put you at risk of elevating your iron levels too much. Always talk to your doctor before proceeding with iron as a means of preventing RLS.

, Two drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: Requip (Ropinirole) and Mirapex (Pramipexole). These drugs are designed to be used specifically as the treatment for RLS. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also prescribe one of the following types of drugs to treat your RLS and to prevent symptoms:


Sedatives (such as clonazepam and zaleplon) are helpful for those whose sleep is disrupted by RLS.
Anticonvulsants (such as carbamazepine) are helpful for people who deal with daytime RLS symptoms.
Pain relievers are prescribed to patients with severe RLS.

, Massage and acupuncture may also help prevent RLS symptoms. A massage can reduce tension in your legs and relax you as well.Acupuncture has shown some benefit for RLS in some studies, but the results are not conclusive.Consider scheduling yourself a massage or acupuncture treatment.

Tape and pad your bunions.,
Ice your bunions to reduce swelling.,
Take over-the-counter painkillers.",How to Relieve Bunions2," You can tape your big toe with medical tape so it lays straight, forming a splint. You can also buy special bunion splints that are worn over the top of your foot and your big toe to help straighten the alignment. Only use a splint with the guidance of your doctor.You can also use moleskin or gel-filled pads on your bunions to protect them and prevent them from rubbing on your shoe. You can get bunion pads over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or online. Some bunion pads stick right to the bunions and others stay on your foot with a small loop that fits over your toe.

, Your big toe joint may be painful and swollen due to the bunion. You can relieve this discomfort by applying an ice pack to the area several times a day. Icing your bunions can offer temporary relief.Wrap the icepack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a cloth. Apply it to your bunions 20 minutes at a time.
You should also get in the habit of elevating your feet after a long day of standing or walking. This will help to reduce any inflammation on your feet due to your bunions., You can alleviate some of the pain and discomfort caused by your bunions by taking OTC painkillers like ibuprofen and paracetamol. Follow the directions on the label for dosage information.Keep in mind taking OTC painkillers is only a temporary solution for your bunion pain. If your bunions become too painful and uncomfortable, you may need to consider surgery to remove them.

Massage your feet with your hands.,
Do arch lifts.,
Try toe stretches.,
Do low-impact exercises.",How to Relieve Bunions3," You can do a quick ten minute foot massage at home using your hands. Massaging your feet can help to loosen the tight muscles around your bunions and on your big toe, reducing pain and cramping in this area.Start by using your thumbs to massage right beneath the mounds of your toes. This will help to release these muscles and loosen any tension in this spot.
You can then massage from the base of your big toe and down through your inner arch. Use your fingers to massage along the little toe side of your foot and anywhere on your sole that feels tight.
Finally, stick your fingers between your toes as far as they will go. You may need to wiggle your fingers to get them between your toes. Work the toes back and forth with your hands to loosen them up further.

, You can stretch your arches by doing arch lifts at home. This will help to stretch and strengthen your arches, making your feet feel less cramped and sore. You can do this exercise on an exercise mat.Start by standing with your feet hip width apart. Then, lift all ten toes and stretch them upward. Slowly lower them back down one by one.
Raise only your small toes and keep your big toe on the ground. Extend your big toe forward and down toward the ground.
Then, ground your big toe mound and inner heel down to the ground. This will keep your arch lifted and strong.

, You should also do toe stretches by moving your toes up and down on the ground. This will help to stretch and strengthen your toe joints.


Lift and extend your big toe several times. Extend it forward, like you are trying to push a button in front of your toe, and then slowly lower it down.After you do this several times, you may notice the muscle that runs from your inner heel through your inner arch to your big toe is starting to ache. This is a good sign, as you want to work this muscle, the abductor hallucis.
Then, lift all of your toes and extend only your little toes out and down toward the ground. Do this several times.
Finish by lifting your middle toes and spreading them out. Then, extend only your big toes and little toes out and down toward the ground.

, To avoid agitating your bunions, you should stick to low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or stationary biking. These activities will not irritate your bunions as much as high-impact activities like running, martial arts, or contact sports.If your bunions become less painful and uncomfortable over time, you may be able to resume high-impact activities and exercises.

Consider surgery if your bunions do not improve within a year.,
Discuss your surgical options with your doctor.,
Allow time for recovery after the surgery.",How to Relieve Bunions4," Surgery is a last resort, and it is is only recommended if your bunions cause you frequent pain and get worse within a year. Often, surgery is done if the bunion is causing other foot issues and negatively affecting the second toe on your foot.Keep in mind that though surgery is the only way to get rid of your bunions, your bunions can grow back if your feet are agitated by improper shoes. You should always wear correctly fitted shoes to prevent your bunions from returning after surgery., There are several different surgical options to treat bunions and the type of surgery you get will depend on how severe your bunions are. Your surgeon may remove the bunions and use pins, wires, or screws to hold the bones in your feet in place to allow them to heal.The most common type of bunion surgery is osteotomy. This procedure involves cutting and removing part of the bone in your toe. The surgeon will also realign the bone inside your big toe and move your toe joint back in line.
Your surgeon may recommend arthrodesis if your big toe is severely deformed due to the bunion and it is too difficult to fix the joint. This procedure involves fusing together two bones in your big toe joint. After this procedure, you will have limited movement of your big toe and you cannot wear high heels.
Most bunion surgeries take about one hour and are done under general anesthesia. Your surgeon should outline the procedure fully for you before you go under.

, Post-surgery, your foot may be swollen for up to three months. You will need to rest your foot to reduce the swelling and use crutches so your foot can heal. You may also need to wear a cast and shoes specially made to allow you to walk on your heels.After your foot has healed, you can go back to wearing normal shoes. However, you should always wear properly fitted and supportive shoes to prevent your bunions from appearing again.

Get a lower leg massage.,
Try ultrasound therapy.,
Schedule a consult at a running store.,
Have some custom orthotics made.",How to Prevent Shin Splints2," A strain occurs when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear, which leads to pain, swelling and some guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage for your lower leg muscles (focusing on the tibialis anterior) might be helpful for preventing a strain because it reduces tension and promotes relaxation.Furthermore, if you have a mild strain, a massage can be helpful for getting rid of mild inflammation. Start with a 30-minute massage, focusing on your shin muscles and calves. Allow the masseuse to go as deep as you can take it without wincing.


Drink lots of purified water after any massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products from your body. Failure to do so might trigger a mild headache or malaise.
As an alternative to a professional massage, consider using a handheld vibrating massager on the soft tissues of your lower leg. Some research indicates that vibrations help to relax and strengthen musculature while stimulating nerves to reduce pain., Therapeutic ultrasound is a therapy used by some doctors, chiropractors and physiotherapists that reduces inflammation in soft tissues and stimulates healing.Ultrasound machines emit sound frequencies through special crystals (although you can't hear it) that positively impact injured cells and tissues within the body. As a preventative treatment, ultrasound may be able to stop the progression of shin splints if you start to feel some mild tenderness in your lower legs.


Treatments are painless and usually last five to 15 minutes, depending if your leg condition involves significant inflammation or not.
Although a single treatment is sometimes sufficient for mild strains, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.

, To better understand what shoes may be best for you, get an evaluation done at a reputable running store. High-end running stores sometimes employ people who are qualified to assess your running gait, examine your arches and check the wear patterns of your old running shoes. They typically aren't doctors or physiotherapists, but they are usually experienced runners or fitness experts who can give you sound advice, which may help prevent shin splints and other conditions of the legs and feet.


You'll get help with selecting the best running shoe based on your foot type (flexible pronator vs. rigid supinator).You may have to run or walk over a computerized force plate as part of your gait assessment.

, Another preventative strategy for shin splints is getting some custom made orthotics for your shoes and/or boots. Orthotics are semi-rigid sole inserts that help support the arch of your foot and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking and running.By providing cushioning and some shock absorption while you run, walk and jump, orthotics can help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.


Medical workers who build and sell orthotics include podiatrists, as well as some physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists.
You'll likely need to remove the factory insoles from your running shoes in order to fit the orthotics in.

Understand the cause.,
Know the symptoms.,
Realize the complications.",How to Prevent Shin Splints3," Shin splints are not considered a serious type of injury, although they can generate lots of pain and hinder the ability to run, or even walk. The main cause is too much strain on the leg muscles below the knee, particularly the tibialis anterior, which is responsible for lifting your foot while walking and running. Sometimes shin splints also involve inflammation of the tibial periosteum, the thin sheath of tissue that wraps around the tibia or shin bone.In rare cases, shin splints may also involve stress (hairline) fractures of the tibia or blood circulation problems in the lower leg.


Risk factors for shin splints include intensive running and hiking (especially on hills), inadequate footwear, flat feet, and poor biomechanics or technique.
Military recruits, professional dancers and athletes such as soccer and basketball players have higher incidence of shin splints.

, The most common symptoms of shin splints include: tenderness, soreness or pain along the inner part of your lower leg, mild inflammation in the same area, and difficulty lifting your toes off the ground (known as dorsiflexion).Pain is often noted during the initial part of a workout or activity, then lessens once the muscles are warmed up, then often reappears near the end of the session after the inflammation accumulates.The pain is often described as dull and annoying initially, but with continuing trauma it can become excruciating for some.


Shin splints often feel worse in the morning because the soft tissues (muscles and tendons) tighten overnight.Shin splints also flare-up when you forcibly try to lift your foot up (dorsiflex) against resistance.
The location and type of the pain is often enough for a correct diagnosis of shin splints, so x-rays, an MRI or diagnostic ultrasound are rarely needed for confirmation.

, Allowing shin splints to develop and then become chronic not only creates pain and disability in your lower legs that's difficult to heal and get rid of, but other joints ""higher up the chain"" get negatively affected.Not being able to lift your foot properly with walking, running or jumping causes other areas above (such as your knee, hip and low back) to overcompensate, which increases the risk of strain or sprain injuries in those locations. As such, preventing shin splints from getting bad with common sense, home remedies, and professional guidance is a smart strategy.


It's important to differentiate (by a qualified doctor, ideally) between other lower leg issues that have overlapping symptoms with shin splints, such as bone fractures, muscle compartment syndrome, popliteal artery entrapment, venous insufficiency and nerve entrapment.
Because females have a higher incidence of diminished bone density and osteoporosis, they are more likely to develop severe shin splints and stress fractures of the tibia."
"
Practice proper ""sleep hygiene."",
Try stretching before bed.,
Take a walk when you need to.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Take a hot or cold shower before bed.",How to Prevent Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)2," ""Sleep hygiene"" is a term used by doctors to describe healthy and consistent sleep habits. It entails:Waking up at the same time every day.
Going to bed at a good hour that will allow you to wake up when your alarm goes off, and not to sleep in any longer.
If you need more sleep, go to bed earlier, rather than waking up later as wake-up time is the most important factor in consistent sleep habits.
Keep your wake-up time the same on weekends as on weekdays (for consistency).
Avoid ""screen time"" (televisions, computer screens, and/or cell phones) right before bed as they wake your brain up with the radiation they emit, making it more difficult to fall asleep.
Keep in mind that good sleep helps to prevent symptoms of RLS, both in the daytime and during subsequent nights. Therefore, the benefit is twofold - not only does ""sleep hygiene"" help you to fall asleep better (as a common symptom of RLS is trouble sleeping), it also diminishes and prevents the presence of symptoms in subsequent days., Winding down with some leg stretches before going to bed can help your legs loosen up and relieve tension. While there’s no conclusive evidence that stretching will prevent RLS, some find it beneficial.


Try gentle forward bends, backward bends, spinal twists, chair pose, and warrior pose in a slow method putting attention on breath.Yoga poses that contract the thigh muscles; stretch the calves, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles; or flex and extend the solar plexus and pelvis are beneficial.

, If you feel RLS symptoms and simply can’t get to sleep, try giving in to the urge to move. Get up and take a walk, even if it’s just around the house. For some people, obeying the urge to walk can sometimes be enough to quell the strange sensations and allow them to get back to sleep again.

, People who are stressed tend to sleep poorly and seem to be more prone to suffering from RLS.Find outlets for relieving stress and ways to cope with it rather than allowing it to dominate your life and affect your health.


If you can't manage your stress effectively, make an appointment with a therapist. Some problems are difficult to solve without professional help, and it’s worth pursuing every resource when your health is on the line.

, Many have found that either a hot or cold shower can help prevent RLS symptoms and aid in a getting a good night’s sleep.Try both a hot and a cold shower to see which method works better for you. On nights when you anticipate having trouble sleeping, jump in the shower before you go to bed.

Seek advice.,
Try toe lifts.,
Do toe curls.,
Pick up marbles.,
Write the alphabet.,
Do a toe extension.,
Try a big toe pull.,
Do resistant ankle inversion.,
Perform resistant ankle eversion.,
Do calf raises.",How to Do Physical Therapy Exercises for the Feet1," If you are experiencing foot or ankle pain, you need to get advice from your doctor or podiatrist. If the pain does not go away, even with rest, ice, and elevation, you may have a fracture. This is even more likely if there is swelling, bruising, or discoloration. You will need to seek medical treatment and get an X-ray to confirm or rule out this possibility.


If you do have a fracture or other injury such as the ones mentioned above, ask your doctor if there are prescribed physical therapy exercises that you can do.;
, Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift your big toe up off the floor slightly while leaving the other four down. Practice this to the point where you can eventually raise up all five toes, one at the time, beginning with the big toe and ending with the fifth toe. Then practice lowering each toe one at a time, beginning with the fifth toe and ending with the big toe. Do two sets of 15.


If you find this difficult at first, just raise your big toe up and down until you get the hang of it. Move slowly through your toes, working up to where you can do all five.
This exercise is meant to strengthen the extenders, one of the groups of muscles which move the toes up and down. Strong extenders and flexors can help greatly with gait and balance and thus help prevent foot injuries from accidents, according to the Summit Medical Group., Place a towel on the ground under your right foot. Stretch your toes out and pull them back in to grip the material with your toes. Lift the cloth one to two inches off the ground and hold for five seconds. Lower it to the ground. Repeat five times. Then repeat on the left side.


Relax your muscles between each grip.
Work up to holding the grip for 10 seconds at a time.
Toe curls focus primarily on strengthening the toe flexors.

, Place 20 marbles and a small bowl on the ground. Sit on the couch or in a chair, relaxed all the way back. With one foot, pick up one marble at a time and place it in the bowl. Then empty the marbles out and do the same thing with your other foot. This exercise will strengthen the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles in the feet. It is also helpful for plantar fasciitis but also for injuries like turf toe, a term use for injury to the great toe caused by hyperextension., Sit on the couch, relaxed against the back. Extend one of your legs and raise one foot several inches off the ground. Trace the alphabet in the air using your big toe as a “pencil.” Then switch legs and do the same with the opposite big toe. This exercise helps to strengthen the extensor and flexor muscles in the foot.


It can also help with plantar fasciitis and turf toe, among other foot conditions. It is especially effective in ankle rehabilitation.
Keep your movements small. Just use your ankle, foot, and toe., Wrap a rubber band around the middle of all five of your toes on your right foot. It should have medium resistance so that it will give slightly. Stretch all of your toes apart. This will cause the band to stretch as far as it will go. Hold the stretch for five seconds and then relax your toes. Perform this stretch five times on each foot.


Make sure to relax for approximately five seconds.
This strengthens the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the foot and is used in the treatment of both plantar fasciitis and turf toe., Loop the rubber band between the big toe on your right foot and the big toe on your left. Place your feet together. Pull your toes apart while trying to keep your ankles together. Stretch the rubber band as far as you can, then relax. Relax for five seconds in between stretches and repeat five times.


This exercise strengthens the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles in the feet.

, Sit on the floor with legs stretched out in front of you. Attach one end of a therapy band to a stationary object, such as the leg of a heavy table. The table should be beside you, down at your feet. Loop the other end of the band around the ball of your foot. The table leg will be off to the side. The loop of the band will wrap around the ball of your foot and extend out beside you toward the table. Using the band for resistance, move your ankle away from the table, pulling against the band to stretch it out.


Do two sets of 15.
This exercise can help to strengthen the malleolus and tibialis muscles on either side of the ankle. It can also help prevent or treat sprains., This exercise is very similar to the inversion. Sit on the floor with legs stretched out in front of you. With the band in the same position as with the inversion, move the loop of the resistance band down so that it is against the arch of the foot instead of the ball. Move your foot up and out against the therapy band.


Do two sets of 15.
This exercise can help to strengthen the peroneal and tibialis muscles on both sides of your ankle. It can also help treat or prevent sprains., Stand straight in front of a wall, counter, or other stable object. Place your hands gently on the wall in front of you. Raise yourself onto your toes in a calf raise exercise. From this raised-toe position, lower your feet to the ground again while keeping yourself balanced with your hands against the wall. Repeat 10 times, making sure to lower yourself slowly to the ground.


For an extra challenge, try raising yourself on 1 foot at a time, and doing 10 reps with each foot."

Scrub your feet.,
Dry your feet.,
Use hand sanitizer.,
Use antiperspirant.,
Keep a mixture of 1/2 regular vinegar and 1/2 isopropyl alcohol.,
Rub your feet with one or more of the following powders.",How to Get Rid of Foot Odor1," It sounds obvious, but a quick rub with soapy water in the shower isn't enough. The objective here is to get rid of any bacteria and dead skin cells that bacteria like to feed on. So when you wash your feet, exfoliate the entire surface of your foot with a washcloth, brush, or any other abrasive mechanism and use anti-bacterial soap. Don't forget to scrub between your toes, either.;
, When you dry your feet, dry them completely. Moisture, whether it's water or sweat, is what creates a fertile breeding ground for bacteria, Take the time to dry your feet thoroughly and don't neglect the space between your toes.

, It may sound weird, but a good hand sanitizer can kill germs on your feet and inhibit bacterial growth.

, The same type of antiperspirant you apply under your arms could also be used for your feet. Just make sure to get a separate stick for each area. Apply it to clean, dry feet at night, then put your socks and shoes on as usual in the morning.It will help keep your feet dry and fresh during the day.


Antiperspirant actually reacts with the electrolytes in sweat to form ""gel plugs"" that block off your sweat ducts. Since each one of your feet has over 250,000 sweat glands(more sweat glands per inch than any other part of your body) a little antiperspirant can go a long way.
Don't apply it right before going out, or you'll be slipping and sliding in your shoes.

, Dribble this daily (use a medicine dropper) over and between your toes and irritated skin on the feet and spread it. Both products are harmless to your skin, but the vinegar kills fungus and the alcohol inhibits or kills bacteria. It also helps get rid of toe fungus on contact.


You can soak your feet in a solution of 1/2 vinegar, 1/2 water as a way to stave off bad odors. Add a few scoops of baking soda and thyme oil drops, both of which also help get rid of stinky smells., Do this between your toes as well. This is what most foot powders and sprays contain to combat foot odor:


Talcum powder. It's an astringent, so it'll dry out your feet.






Baking soda. This creates an alkaline environment that's not bacteria-friendly.






Corn starch. This helps absorb sweat.

The following measures must be avoided:



Heat. Exposure to heat causes dilation of blood vessels that can generate more episodes of bleeding. Thus hot baths, saunas, heat packs or even contact with hot environments must be avoided.

Further movement. Limitations of certain activities must be considered to avoid further injury to the involved area.

Massage. Any pressure placed on the affected area may lead to more damage.;
, Avoidance of activities is usually recommended during the first 24 to 72 hours of injury. Adequate breaks or rest should be promoted to ensure proper healing and prevent further damage to the surrounding muscles and tissues of the affected area.


Some exercises may be helpful after the initial 72 hours have passed; those will be discussed below. Ideally, they would be conducted under the supervision of a physical therapist. Apart from these, it's best to stay off it.

, Splint and bandages may be placed on the involved area to stabilize it and prevent unnecessary movements that can further damage the tissues and muscles. Talk to your doctor about what methods of immobilization are best for your case.

, During the first 24 to 72 hours after the injury, ice wrapped in a moist towel should be placed over the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes at a time with 2 to 3 hour intervals in between. Follow these guidelines to be sure that you don't cause tissue damage, a result of freezing skin.


Exposure to cold temperature causes the blood vessels to narrow thus decreasing flow of blood and swelling in the affected area. Compression also aids in stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury.

Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which is an important function during the tissue regeneration process., Continuous elevation of the injured area must be given much importance to ensure proper blood circulation and healing of the involved area. Keeping it elevated will reduce blood flow, thus reducing swelling.


When sitting or lying down, prop your knee up with a few pillows. It's best to lay down, but you may also sit – so long as your pelvis is beneath your knee.

, Over the counter drugs that are used to relieve pain can be incredibly helpful. However, before you start on medication, know that it's best to discuss treatment with your doctor. He or she will likely know which route is best for you and/or be able to prescribe you a stronger medication.


If pain is gets severe and swelling is present, consider taking celebrex; 400 mg on the first dose and 200 mg twice daily as needed for subsequent doses.If you're lucky enough to be without swelling and only experiencing mild pain, try 650 to 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 to 6 hours as needed.

If you drink alcohol, take precaution. Certain medications react negatively with alcohol. Consult your doctor for advice if this applies to you.



, These are oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, they should not be taken during the first 48 hours of injury because they reduce inflammation, which is considered one of the body’s compensatory mechanisms. In other words, intake of this drug during this period may interrupt healing.Examples are Ibuprofen, Aspirin and Naproxen. All of these work by blocking certain body chemicals that ground the progress of inflammation in the involved area.

, We'll discuss physical therapy exercises in the next section. For the meantime, know that starting physical therapy can be an incredibly effective way of shortening the healing process. Consult your doctor first before starting therapy; he or she will know what's appropriate for you.


Exercises should only be done under the guidance of a therapist so that you will do the exercises correctly and not worsen the situation.

, This should only be considered if other means fall short. Knee surgery can be performed to patch up and join injured tissues of the meniscus to restore its normal functioning.


The surgery is called total meniscectomy, which is a surgery that removes the entire meniscus. Again, your doctor will know if this is a viable option.

, Physical therapy involves various exercises that can help you overcome your condition. Starting an exercise regimen with a professional can help you regain strength of the meniscus and preserve its optimal performance.


The first five exercises discussed below can be done immediately and be followed by the rest once the pain felt in the knee has minimized.These exercises involving movements of the muscles promote better circulation of blood and distribution of oxygen to the affected area. Sufficient supply of oxygen maintains cellular integrity, function and aids in the speedy repair of damaged tissues., This is often suggested if patients are not capable of extending the knee completely. Here's how to do this exercise:


Once in a lying position, put a rolled-up towel beneath the heel of the damaged leg to raise it at least six inches from the floor.
Rest the muscles of the leg for two minutes and allow gravity to gradually straighten the knee.
Repeat the step for three times and execute the exercise for as many repetitions as desired.

, Once the pain has started to subside, you can try the heel slide. Here's how:


Assuming a sitting position, extend your legs in front of you and gradually slide the heel of the foot on the injured side toward the buttocks.
Return to the starting position and repeat the exercise for up to 15 sets.

, In a standing position, place your hands on the wall at eye level. Place the injured leg behind you with your heel grounded on the floor while the other leg is positioned forward with your knee bent. As the back foot is slightly turned inward, slowly lean towards the wall until a stretch is felt in the calf.


Keep the position for 15 to 30 seconds and return to the initial pose. This exercise can be repeated several times a day.

, Lying on the ground with your buttocks near the doorway, extend the uninjured leg through the doorway. Then, elevate the injured leg and rest it against the wall beside the door frame. Maintain the position until a stretch is felt at the back of the thigh and repeat it three times.


Feel free to hold this stretch for as long as feels good. This stretch is especially nice as the doorway takes the pressure off your legs to hold the stretch and the pressure off your arms to hold your leg.

, Lie flat on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Bend the knee of the uninjured leg slightly and position the same foot flat on the floor. Stiffen the thigh muscles of the injured leg and raise it about eight inches from the ground. Then gradually place the leg back in its original position. Repeat this exercise for 15 times.

, Position your head, shoulders and back against the wall. The feet should be three feet away from the wall. Put a ball behind your back and slowly squat down to a 45 degree angle. Maintain the position for 10 seconds and then return to starting point. Repeat for 10 times.


This exercise is also great for your core. Try lifting your arms up to a 90 degree angle when you hit the peak of your squat, lowering as you release.

, In a standing position, elevate the injured leg at least three to five inches off the ground while the other leg is left flat on the floor. Slowly alternate the position of each leg and do two sets of 15.


Once your knee can take it, try working with stackable circuit steps like you find at the gym. Experiment with different heights for a maximum stretch.

, Cover the ankle of the uninjured leg with elastic tubing then tie it on a door at about ankle height. Facing the door, bend the injured knee slightly and keep the muscles tight. Hold the position while moving the uninjured leg straight back behind you. Perform 2 sets of 15.


Alternatively, try resisted terminal knee extension. Using elastic tubing, make a loop and tie it on a door at knee height. Step the injured leg on the loop and bend it at about 45 degrees while the other leg is raised off the floor. Gradually straighten your leg and maintain stiffness in your thigh muscles. Repeat this exercise for 15 times.

, A torn meniscus is the most common knee injury.If you think this issue is afflicting you, here's what to look for:



A popping sensation in the knees. These are snapping sounds when you do activities involving the knee. If the knee is stationary for a couple of minutes and then you try to bend it, a snapping sound is normal, but if you bend for several times again and snapping sounds are still present, it maybe a symptom of having a knee problem.

Swelling and stiffness. Fluids are present in our joint which helps in its movement. If you have torn meniscus, there is an accumulation of too much fluid making the knees swell. Swelling is accompanied by stiffness. Stiffness is difficulty in moving you knee joints and loss of motion when you are trying to do activities involving the knee.

Pain. Swelling and stiffness are also accompanied by pain. It is present especially when putting pressure on the knees or when moving them. You might be unable to bend your knee because of so many pain. Your knee may look like it is locked and cannot be moved.

, In this situation, a tolerable sensation of pain may be felt during the incident of injury. Pain can be related to the slight swelling, in addition to the injury to the involved tissues that occurs progressively over time.


This sharp pain may be relieved after two to three weeks with limitations from strenuous activities. Certain movements such as squatting, bending, lifting and twisting may trigger recurrence of these symptoms.

, Individuals affected by a moderate tear may suffer from sharp pains that occur either at the side or at the center portion of the knee, especially when squatting or twisting. Inflammation may get worse over two to three days and can make the knee stiff. Walking can still be possible but bending may be restricted.


Symptoms usually subside in one to two weeks but can persist with prolonged use of the knee. Soreness can be experienced for several years if the tear is left unmanaged.

, This type is accompanied by a greater level of pain and the abrupt appearance of swelling and stiffness. The pain may be sharp, pulsating and excruciating. Presence of inflammation may be visible over two to three days. Some parts of the worn out meniscus may even move into the joint space.


These symptoms may lead to instability of the knee or trouble in walking properly and straightening the knee. Needless to say, medical treatment must be sought.

, Medical records of patients are taken to gauge the connection of present symptoms to past injuries that might damage or injure the knee. Health practitioners will then perform several examinations and tests to evaluate the functioning of the knee such as:



Knee evaluation. Each knee is checked from signs of tenderness, knee instability, inappropriate range of motion, soreness at a particular area and incapacity to put pressure on the affected leg.

X-ray. This is performed to assess the knee bones for presence of inflammation.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This is commonly ordered by orthopedists to make a decisive diagnosis for the condition. It provides a clearer view of the site and severity of the meniscus tear together with its surrounding ligaments, tendons and cartilages.

Arthroscopy. This is done by an orthopedist to inspect the interior side of the knee joint by inserting an instrument called an arthroscope through a tiny incision. This apparatus contains a camera with light to directly view and even treat the meniscus tear.

, Some patients might find it painful to undergo certain examinations. In cases like this, doctors may recommend withdrawal of fluid from the knee joint or injection of a local anaesthesia to act as a numbing medicine. It should not add to your pain.These actions can alleviate pain and can help in the pursuance of the examination. However, if it fails, assessment may be delayed until inflammation or pain subsides.

Recognize the signs.,
Don't use over the counter options.,
Take oral medication.,
Try topical antifungal prescription medications.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical treatment.,
Consider non-pharmacological, non-surgical treatment.,
Try laser treatment.",How to Get Rid of Toe Fungus1," Before you can treat toenail fungus, you need to know what to look for. Nail fungus does not necessarily have consistent symptoms. The most common sign that you have nail fungus is tenderness or pain in the nail. Signs of a fungal infection include changes in your nail, such as color changes. The nail will usually get yellow or white streaks on the side of the nail. There is usually due to a build up of debris under or around the nail, a crumbling and thickening of the outside edges of the nail, a loosening or lifting up of the nail, and nail brittleness.Although treatment is usually sought for cosmetic reasons, nail fungus can be serious and should be treated. For example, if it is a severe infection, it can cause permanent damage to your nails. The infection can also spread beyond your nails, especially if you are in a high risk group, such as people with diabetes or impaired immune systems. High-risk people can develop cellulitis, a skin tissue infection, if toe fungus isn't treated.Toenail fungus is caused by fungi such as trichophyton rubrum. It is also caused by non-dermatophyte molds and yeast, most commonly from the Candida species.;
, Nail fungus is hard to treat and repeat infections are very common. Contrary to common belief, over the counter antifungal creams are usually for athlete's foot and do not effectively treat toenail fungus. This is because they cannot penetrate the nail., The most effective way to get rid of nail fungus is systemic treatment with oral prescription antifungals. Treatment with oral medications can take 2-3 months or longer. Oral antifungal prescription medications include Lamisil, which is usually prescribed with a dose of 250 mg a day for 12 weeks. Side effects can include rash, diarrhea, or liver enzyme abnormalities. This medication should not be used if you have liver or kidney issues.


You can also try itraconazole (Sporanox), which is usually prescribed with a dose of 200 mg a day for 12 weeks. Side effects can include nausea, rash, or liver enzyme abnormalities. It should not be used if you have liver issues. Sporanox also has interactions with over 170 different drugs such as Vicodin and Prograf. Check with your doctor to ensure any medication you are taking does not interfere with it.Before getting any prescription, tell your doctor if you have liver disease, a history of depression, a weak immune system, or an autoimmune disorder. These medications may cause liver toxicity.

, Topical medications are not recommended alone, but they can be used in addition to oral therapy to decrease the duration of your treatment. However, if you have reservations about oral therapy or are hesitant to start long-term oral therapy, topical medications are a good option.


You can try Ciclopirox, which is an 8% solution is usually applied daily for 48 weeks.You can also try the more recent medication Jublia, which is a 10% solution that is also applied daily for 48 weeks.
Topical prescriptions may be effective if the infection does not involve the nail matrix, the layer of cells at the base of the nail. Your doctor will let you know if your infection has expanded to include the nail matrix.

, If you have a severe case of toenail fungus, you may need to have surgery to fix it. The options include partial or complete nail removal. After the infected nail is surgically removed, antifungal cream is applied to the area to prevent reinfection of the new nail.


Total nail removal is not commonly needed., These methods don't require you to take drugs or get surgery. These include nail debridement, which is the removal of dead or infected tissue and trimming of the nail. This option is used for severe infections or for infections that cause abnormal growths.


Generally doctors apply urea ointment and cover it with a dressing. This softens the nail over a period of 7-10 days after which the doctor can easily remove the diseased portion of the nail. It is usually a painless procedure., Laser treatment options are available but are generally very costly. They use a high focus beam to eradicate the fungus in the affected area. It can take several treatments to clear the infection, which means you have to pay even more each time you go.This treatment is still largely experimental. Until further studies are conducted, laser treatment is not recommended for routine use.

Know what the most common artificial sweeteners are and what brands offer them.,
Taste the artificial sweeteners.,
Dissolve the sweetener in 8 fluid oz.,
Determine how much you are willing to spend.",How to Choose an Artificial Sweetener," There are many artificial sweeteners found in packaged food, but there are only 4 common artificial sweeteners widely available to consumers in either bulk form or pre-packaged individual serving sizes.


Splenda: This is the artificial sweetener sucralose and is 600 times sweeter than sugar. Sucralose is calorie free and will not affect blood sugar levels. This sweetener works well for both hot and cold food applications because it has high water solubility and retains its sweetness without developing bitter notes when heated. It can be purchased in individual packets or in a baking mix that has either sugar or maltodextrin in it. Currently, Splenda has a sucralose product with fiber for those looking to increase fiber in their diet. Baking with sucralose can change the texture of food because of the reduced amount needed to achieve sweetness and because it does not melt as well as sugar.
Sweet One: This is the artificial sweetener acesulfame potassium (also labeled as acesulfame K) and is 200 times sweeter than sugar. This sweetener works well for beverages and will work well for baking when combined with other sweeteners to bulk it up and help mask a slight bitter note. It doesn’t add any color when cooking, but when used in combination with sugar, it can achieve a golden brown color. Sweet One is mainly sold in individual packets where 1 packet is as sweet as 2 teaspoons of sugar. Acesulfame potassium is calorie free and will not affect blood sugar levels.
Sweet N’ Low: This is the artificial sweetener saccharin and is 300 times sweeter than sugar. This sweetener works best in cold items, such as beverages and whipped cream. However, saccharin does not dissolve readily in cold water. Saccharin doesn’t work well when heated because it develops a bitter taste, but combining it with other sweeteners will mask the bitterness. Sweet N’ Low is available in many forms, including a brown sugar substitute. It is calorie free and has no effect on blood sugar. Saccharin is not recommended for children or pregnant women due to studies showing that saccharin is a possible carcinogen. It is considered safe for use as an artificial sweetener in the US, and since 2000 has not had to carry a warning label.
Equal: This is the artificial sweetener aspartame and is 200 times sweeter than sugar. It works well with cold items, but loses sweetness when heated and is not recommended for baking. Equal is mainly sold in individual packets where 1 packet is as sweet as 2 teaspoons of sugar. Aspartame provides 4 calories per gram and has little effect on blood sugar;
, The amount of sugar 1 packet replaces should be on the package. You should start with a clean palette when tasting.


Clean your palette by eating a cracker and drinking some room temperature water (cold or hot water will affect taste buds and may change perception of sweet and bitter) before and after tasting.
Take note of the differences between them and decide which you like best plain.

, of water. Dissolving the sweetener in water will tell you 2 things about the sweetener: First, how soluble the sweetener is in water, and, second, how it tastes when diluted. This is helpful when deciding if it will go good in a beverage or in a recipe. If the sweetener doesn’t dissolve well, then it won’t work well for cold items or some recipes that have little moisture in them. If the sweetener is still very sweet when diluted, then you know you will need to use less and vice versa.

, All artificial sweeteners are more expensive than sugar, but you can use less.


Check the prices per serving by dividing the price by the amount of servings listed on the package. Some will be much more expensive than others and may help determine which artificial sweetener is right for you.

Ask your doctor about injections to relieve heel pain.,
Try Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT).,
Have surgery if no other treatments work.",How to Get Rid of Heel Spurs2," Your doctor may inject a corticosteroid along with a local anesthetic like Xylocaine. Some doctors may inject Botox into your foot to relax the plantar fascia.

, ESWT uses sound waves to slightly injure the tissues surrounding the heel, which could cause the parts that are causing pain to heal.

, Before performing surgery, doctors usually give home treatments and improved footwear about a year to work. When nothing else eases the pain, here's what you need to know about surgical options:



Instep plantar fasciotomy: Doctors remove part of the plantar fascia to ease pressure on the nerves in your foot.

Endoscopy: This surgery performs the same function as an instep plantar fasciotomy but uses smaller incisions so that you'll heal faster. However, endoscopy has a higher rate of nerve damage, so consider this before you opt for this option.Be prepared to wear a below-the-knee walking cast to ease the pain of surgery and to speed the healing process. These casts, or ""boots,"" usually work better than crutches to speed up your recovery time."
"
Apply an icepack.,
Take over-the-counter medicine to ease the pain.,
Get some rest.,
Wear night splints.,
Perform some exercises.",How to Get Rid of Heel Spurs3," Place your icepack on your heel for 10 to 15 minutes at least twice a day. You can also try rolling your foot over an iced can or bottle if your heel spurs are accompanied by plantar fasciitis.

, Try acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

, You need to stay off of your aching foot as much as possible for at least a week.


Think about possible causes of the problem while you're resting and figure out how you can make some changes. Some actions that can contribute to heel spurs include:

Running too often or running on hard surfaces such as concrete
Tight calf muscles
Shoes with poor shock absorptionEase back into your activities. In many cases, you'll be in too much pain to go ahead with a strenuous exercise routine that puts pressure or impact on your heel. Listen to your body and switch to different activities such as swimming or riding a bike until your heel spurs improve.

, Splints stretch your plantar fascia while you're sleeping. For example, you can wear a device that consists of an L-shaped fiberglass splint and wrap a bandage around it to keep it in place while you're asleep., Exercises that strengthen and lengthen your plantar fascia can also be very helpful for heel spurs. Try some of the following activities:



Calf stretch: Place your hands on a wall. Extend 1 foot (0.3 m) behind you with your knee straight and place the other foot in front of you with the knee bent. Push your hips toward the wall and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. You should feel a pull in your calf muscles. Repeat the stretch 20 times for each foot.

Plantar fascia stretch: Perform this exercise in the morning before you've done any standing or walking. Cross your injured foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp your toes and gently pull them toward you. If you can't reach your toes, then wrap a towel around them and pull on the towel. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 20 times for each foot."

Choose new shoes that are the right size.,
Walk around before you buy shoes.,
Use orthotic inserts.",How to Get Rid of Heel Spurs4," Have your foot measured when you go to the shoe store instead of taking a guess about the size. Also, try on shoes at the end of the day or after a workout, when your feet are at their largest. To ensure a good fit, wear the same type of socks or nylons that you would normally wear with the type of shoe that you are trying on.

, Before you purchase your shoes, do the following:


Re-lace the shoes if you're trying on athletic shoes. Start at the farthest eyelets and apply even pressure to the laces as you come closer to the tongue of the shoe.
Make sure that you can wiggle your toes freely inside of the shoe. Also, make sure that you have at enough space between your tallest toe and the end of the shoe. You should have room equal to about the width of your thumb in the tip of your shoe.
Walk around to make sure that the shoe has a firm grip on your heel without sliding up and down.
Walk or run a few steps to make sure your shoes are comfortable. Shoes that fit properly require no break-in period., You can purchase orthotics over the counter, or you can have orthotics specially fitted by your podiatrist. Try 1 of these options:



Heel cups: These inserts will help to align the bones in your foot and to cushion your heel. Check your skin for blisters when you first start using heel cups. Also, your feet may sweat more with a heel cup, so change your socks and shoes often.

Insoles: While you can pick up generic insoles at a drugstore, you may have more luck if you go to a store that sells athletic shoes. Push on the arch to make sure that it doesn't collapse. If your insoles help but could use a little work, you can take them to a podiatrist to get them customized.

Custom orthotics: A podiatrist can make a cast of your foot and provide you with custom-made orthotics. These may be more expensive, but they are made of materials specifically designed for your needs, and they can last up to 5 years if your podiatrist refurbishes them every 1 or 2 years. To find a podiatrist near you, look at the Web page for the American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine.Dynamic Insoles: Lack of elasticity in plantar fascia in the foot is for most people the real problem. If there is poor elasticity in the lengthwise tendons in the foot (plantar fascia) in relation to a person's general condition, only a small additional strain is required for the pull on the tendons to cause damage to the tissues connecting the tendons to the heel bone. This will generate an inflamed condition called Plantar Fasciitis.

The pain associated with Plantar Fasciitis is typically noticeable from the heel bone and forward towards the front of the foot. It is, however, also possible for the pain to show in the heel cushion, alongside the foot, on top of the foot and up into the Achilles tendon. The water wave therapy is the only therapy that works actively to solve the heel problem. This is achieved by exercising the tendons in the foot towards the necessary elasticity and at the same time providing pain relief for the heel by employing very special water-based shock absorbing and dynamic pressure relief system.

Test your ankle range of motion.,
Do plantar flexion.,
Try dorsiflexion.,
Do an Achilles stretch.,
Perform a standing calf stretch.,
Stretch your toe flexors.",How to Do Physical Therapy Exercises for the Feet2," Sit with your legs stretched straight out in front of you. Without moving legs, point your feet backward towards your body as far as they will comfortably go. Hold for 10 seconds. Then, point your toes down away from your body. Hold for 10 more seconds. Next, point toes towards the opposite foot and hold for 10 seconds. Then, point your toes away from the opposite foot and hold for 10 more seconds. Lastly, move the ankles 10 times clockwise and 10 times counterclockwise.


This exercise was developed by the Summit Medical Group, a rehabilitation center, to help increase the range of motion or flexibility of the ankles.
According to Summit, increased flexibility and strength in the ankle muscles, especially the tibialis muscles, can help to greatly reduce injuries such as sprains.
Use this series as a warm-up for the remaining stretching exercises., This stretch is similar to the warm up, but it is a more targeted stretch. Sit against the couch with your feet straight out in front of you, so that they are perpendicular to your legs. Flex your feet back towards you as far as they will go while keeping your legs flat on the ground. Try to keep your feet extended, so your toes and heels move in a straight line. Hold for five seconds. Relax and then push your toes away from the body as far as they will go.


Repeat 15 times, moving both feet at the same time. You can also do this exercise while you are lying down.
To get a deeper stretch, you can use an elastic band.
Pointing the toes away from the body helps to strengthen the muscles in the calves.

, Sit in a chair and flex your right foot. Loop a large towel under your foot. Pull on the ends of the towel and pull it toward you. Stretch your toes towards you as far as you can while remaining comfortable. Hold stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times with each foot.


This stretches the muscles in the shins. Flexible shins, like calves, are important for full recovery from plantar fasciitis.
You can also do this with a resistance band on the floor. Hook the band around a table leg. Walk away from the table and loop your foot in the band. Bring your toes toward you, pulling against the band., Stand on a stair. Move until you are only standing on the stair with the balls of your feet. Hold onto the railings or wall on both sides for balance. Slowly lower your heel towards the step below you until you feel the stretching in the calf muscles. Hold this pose for 15-30 seconds, then relax. Do three reps.


This exercise helps stretch out the muscles of the calf. Calf muscle stretching, according to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society, is integral to the treatment of plantar fasciitis. This is because excessively tight calf muscles make it more difficult to properly flex and stretch the heel. This is necessary to help recover from this painful condition. , Stand facing the wall with hands resting on the wall for balance. Step forward with one leg and bend the knee slightly. Stretch the other leg behind you so that your heel is resting on the floor. Then, lean slowly into the wall until you feel the stretching in your calf. Hold for 15–30 seconds and do three reps.


This exercise stretches the soleus, one of the major muscles in the calf..

, Stand facing the wall, placing your hands on the wall for balance. Stretch your leg out behind you and point your foot, placing the top of your foot on the ground. Relax and feel the stretching in the ankle. Hold this pose for 15–30 seconds, stopping to rest for a moment if you feel any cramping in the toes. Do three reps on each foot.


Work yourself up to holding the stance for one minute.
This is designed to stretch out the flexors muscles in the foot, which help you move the feet in relation to the leg."
"
Know the importance of massage.,
Perform a ball roll.,
Give yourself a plantar fascia massage.",How to Do Physical Therapy Exercises for the Feet3," Doctors and clinics such as the Sports Injuries Clinic endorse foot massage. They are relaxing, but massages also increase circulation to the feet. They also help prevent injuries such as muscle strains or sprains., Sit on a chair and place a tennis, lacrosse, or golf ball under the ball of your right foot (a tennis ball is probably the most comfortable for your foot). Roll the ball with your feet, moving the ball along the bottom of your foot from ball to heel. Continue the movement for two minutes. You should feel the massage throughout your foot.


Try moving the ball up and down and in circles to increase the efficacy of the massage. Repeat on left foot for 2 minutes., While sitting on the chair, place your right foot on top of your left thigh. Use your thumb to gently work circles into your arch. Run your hands up and down your foot, releasing the muscles through the whole foot. Place your fingers between your toes as if you were holding hands with your feet. Keep this position with your toes spread for 30 seconds. Massage each toe to release extra tension."

Wear sandals or open-toed shoes.,
Change your socks daily.,
Lightly powder shoes and socks daily with baking soda.,
Use cedar wood or cloves to freshen shoes.,
Use cedar wood insoles.,
Rotate your shoes.,
Wash your shoes regularly.,
Remove your shoes often.,
Use a shoe dryer.",How to Get Rid of Foot Odor2," Wearing open shoes lets the air flow around your feet, keeping them cool and keeping you from producing as much sweat. When you do sweat, it will evaporate quickly due to air circulation.


During colder months, wear leather or canvas shoes that allow your feet to ""breathe."" Steer clear of rubber and plastic shoes.

, Socks absorb your sweat when you wear them, and it dries when you take them off. Putting on a dirty pair of socks for the second day in a row is essentially going to reheat that sweat, leading to a foul smell. Change your socks every day, especially if your feet tend to get sweaty.


Unless you're wearing open shoes; you should always wear socks. Try two pairs of socks to help with the wicking of moisture away from the foot.






When you wash your socks, turn them inside out in the washer, so the dead flakes of skin have a better chance of being washed away.






Go for absorbent socks made of cotton or wool. Non-absorbent socks (like nylon) trap moisture around your foot, making a cozy little nook for bacteria.

, Dust out yesterday's baking soda before adding the fresh amount. Baking soda absorbs moisture and odors.

, Put cedar wood shavings or whole cloves inside your shoes for a few days when you don't need to wear them. The odor will disappear after a few days.

, In addition to cedar wood shavings you can also use cedar wood insoles. The natural cedar wood essential oils have antibacterial and antifungal properties, which fight bacteria and help to cure and prevent foot odor, athlete's foot, and nail fungus. It is also a convenient way without the need for daily routines like powdering or creaming.

, Let your shoes dry out completely so that bacteria don't set up camp in there. It takes at least 24 hours for a shoe to dry out completely.


Take out the insoles to help the drying process along. Otherwise, wearing the same pair day after day is a recipe for stinky feet. Crumple newspaper inside wet shoes so it will dry them overnight.






, Many shoes can be thrown in the washing machine. Just make sure they dry thoroughly before you put them on.

, Whenever you can take a break, and no one is looking, remove your shoes. This helps the shoes and your feet stay drier.

, There are several great, low-wattage shoe and boot dryers that use convection air currents to slowly and completely dry wet, sweaty shoes. Place your footwear on them at the end of the day or workout and put on dry, warm and comfortable shoes about eight hours later. Dryers eliminate the moisture that odor-causing bacteria need to grow and help your shoes to last longer.

Use bleach.,
Do a tea soak.,
Use salt water.,
Apply aluminum acetate.,
Make a baking soda mixture.,
Mix vinegar in water.,
Put baby powder in your shoes.,
Clean your feet with a pumice stone on a daily basis.",How to Get Rid of Foot Odor3," Add about two tablespoons (1 ounce) of bleach to a gallon of warm water. Soak your feet in this solution for 5 to 10 minutes a day for a week. If you find this soak to be drying to your skin, you may apply a baby oil.


Bleach your white socks in the laundry. If your shoes can withstand it, add the same solution to the insides of your shoes and soak them down. Wait 1/2 hour and then just rinse them out in the sink. Dry them thoroughly before wearing them again.







, Soak your feet in tea 30 minutes a day for one week. The tannic acid in the tea will dry out your skin., Apply half a cup of kosher salt for every quart of water. After soaking, don't rinse your feet and just dry thoroughly., This will dry out your feet. Mix 1 packet Domeboro powder or 2 tablespoons Burow's Solution (both available over-the-counter) in 1 pint of water. Soak for 10 to 20 minutes at a time.

, Apply one tablespoon baking soda for every quart of water. This makes skin more alkaline, which inhibits bacterial growth.

, This makes skin more acidic. Add a 1/2 cup vinegar for every 1 quart of water.


Keep in mind that some people's foot odor can be described as ""vinegary"" so if this is you, this soak might make things worse.


, Applying baby powder or baking soda in your shoes and socks will help dry out any future odors.

, This will remove the dead skin and prevent the bacteria from forming."

Apply Vick's VapoRub.,
Use tea tree oil.,
Try snakeroot leaf extract.,
Prevent future occurrences.",How to Get Rid of Toe Fungus2," You can get over the counter vapor rub from Vick's to help your fungus. A study showed that daily application of Vick's VapoRub for 48 weeks can be as effective as topical treatment options such as Ciclopirox 8% for nail fungus.To treat nail fungus with Vick's VapoRub, first make sure your nail is clean and dry. Apply a small amount of Vick's VapoRub on the affected area daily with your finger or a cotton swab, preferably at night. Continue treatment for up to 48 weeks.


Your infection may go away before 48 weeks, but continue for a few weeks after signs of your infection go away to ensure it is cured.

, Tea tree oil is a natural anti-fungal. One study showed that tea tree oil may be effective for nail fungus. 18% of patients who used tea tree oil twice daily for 24 weeks were cleared of the infection.To treat nail fungus with tea tree oil, use a 100% solution because lower concentrations have not been proven to be effective for this particular infection.Make sure your nail is clean and dry before application. Apply a small amount tea tree oil solution with a cotton swab to affected area twice a day for up to 6 months.

, In a study that included 110 people, snakeroot extract was shown to be about as effective as topical treatment options. To use this method, apply the extract every third day for 4 weeks, twice a week for the next 4 weeks, then once a week for the next 4 weeks.


Snakeroot leaf extract is not commonly available in the US. It is a traditional Mexican remedy and is more commonly found in Mexico., There are many situations that make you more at risk for infection. You are at a higher risk if you are older, have diabetes, have an impaired immune system, or have poor circulation. If you are at high risk, you should take extra care to prevent infection. Preventative measures include wearing shoes or sandals when you are at damp public areas such as swimming pools or gyms, keeping your toenails clipped and clean, making sure your feet are dry, and drying your feet after you shower.


You should wear clean, absorbent socks. Wool, nylon, and polypropylene are materials that help keep your feet dry. You should also change your socks often.
You should discard old shoes after you get rid of your fungus. They can contain remnants of the fungi. You can also wear open toe shoes to help reduce humidity.
Do not share nail clippers or tools used for manicures and pedicures. Choose nail salons carefully.
Use antifungal powder or spray to help reduce your chances of infection.
Avoid wearing nail polish or using artificial products on your nails. This can trap moisture and provide a damp area for fungus to grow."

Retake each measurement three times.",How to Calculate Body Fat With a Tape Measure,"  The first measurement for males is measuring the neck.    Follow these guidelines to make sure your measurement is accurate:

Look straight ahead. Relax your shoulders without hunching.

Place the measuring tape just below the Adam's apple (larynx).

Lay the tape flat and pull the tape around the circumference of the neck.

Note and record the measurement, rounding up to the nearest half inch.

For an example, your neck measurement might be 18 inches.
;
,  Measuring your core is an essential part of your body fat as this is an area of the body that may contain higher amounts of body fat. Keep the tape flat against your skin, without compressing your soft tissue:

Guide the measuring tape around the waist at the belly button.

For best results, let your arms hang at your sides while someone else measures.Breathe in and exhale normally.

Record the abdomen measurement after you have released the breath.

For example, your abdomen may measure 35 inches.


,  Your body fat percentage is dependent on your height making this a necessary measurement.

Stand straight against a wall or other flat surface.

Pull your shoulders back, keep your head up, and look straight ahead.

Place a ruler or straight edge against the top of your head and push it against the wall. Mark this location with a pencil.

Extend the measuring tape from the floor up to the pencil mark on the wall.

Record this measurement in inches.

For example, if you are 6 feet tall, write down 72 inches.


, Plug the three measurements into the male body fat formula below.For the most accurate answer, enter the full calculation in one line using an online calculator. Here's the formula along with an example using the example measurements above:

%Fat =86.010log⁡(abdomen−neck)−70.041log⁡(height)+36.76{\displaystyle =86.010\log(abdomen-neck)-70.041\log(height)+36.76}=86.010log⁡(35−18)−70.041log⁡(72)+36.76{\displaystyle =86.010\log(35-18)-70.041\log(72)+36.76}=86.010log⁡(17)−70.041log⁡(72)+36.76{\displaystyle =86.010\log(17)-70.041\log(72)+36.76}=12.5{\displaystyle =12.5}The man in this example has an estimated body fat percentage of 12.5.

This formula uses log10, which is the default log button on calculators.


, There is no ideal body fat percentage that all men should aim for. If you are working toward a specific goal (especially in competitive athletics), it's best to follow expert advice. For general fitness goals, use the following rough guidelines:A typical healthy man can have anywhere from 8 to 20% body fat (11–22% if over 40 years old, or 13–25% if over 60).

Men with body fat percentage of 20% or higher may be at risk for weight-related health problems. 25% or higher may be classified as obese.

Athletes vary by sport, with the leanest (such as cyclists and bodybuilders) typically around 5–10%.Men typically carry about 2-5% of essential body fat. Falling below your essential body fat percentage is dangerous. Your body's fat stores have an active role in the regular functioning and protection of your body.


, Take all measurements with the tape flat against your skin, but not compressing it:Look straight ahead and relax your shoulders without hunching.

Place the tape flat around your neck, just below the larynx (Adam's apple). Keep the tape level, at the same height on the front and back of the neck.

Round the measurement up to the nearest half inch. For example, if your neck measures 14.6 inches, round up to 15 inches.


, Guide the measuring tape around the circumference of the waist at the most narrow point, usually between the belly button and the sternum. If you're not sure where this is, measure at several points and use the smallest value:

For best results, hang your arms at your sides while someone else measures.

Breathe in and exhale normally.

Record the abdomen measurement at the end of the breath. Round down to the nearest half inch.

For example, your abdomen might measure 28 inches around.


, Women may carry more body fat around their hips compared to men. Including this measurement is important for an accurate estimate of female body fat:

You can measure against your skin or over thin clothing. If you are wearing tight clothing that compresses your soft tissue, change into something else and wait 30 minutes.Wrap the measuring tape around the hips so that it winds around the widest part of the buttocks, as viewed from the side. Keep the tape parallel to the floor.

Record this measurement, rounding down to the nearest half inch.

An example of your hip measurement might be 32 inches.


, Take height into account, since a taller woman has larger measurements than a shorter woman with the same proportions:

Stand straight against a wall or other flat surface.

Pull your shoulders back, keep your head up, and look straight ahead.

Place a ruler or straight edge against the top of your head. Hold it flat and mark the wall with a pencil.

Measure from the floor up to the pencil mark on the wall.

Record the result in inches. For example, if you are 5'5"", write down 65 inches.


, To avoid rounding errors, enter the following equation on one line of a calculator:Female body fat % =163.205log⁡(waist+hip−neck)−97.684log⁡(height)−78.387{\displaystyle 163.205\log(waist+hip-neck)-97.684\log(height)-78.387}

For instance, entering the example measurements above:Body fat % =163.205log⁡(28+32−15)−97.684log⁡(65)−78.387{\displaystyle 163.205\log(28+32-15)-97.684\log(65)-78.387}=163.205log⁡(45)−97.684log⁡(65)−78.387{\displaystyle =163.205\log(45)-97.684\log(65)-78.387}=14.33{\displaystyle =14.33}This woman has approximately 14.33% body fat.

This formula uses log10{\displaystyle log_{10}}, the default log button on calculators.


, Use these guidelines as a starting point to determine whether you are at a healthy body fat percentage:

A body fat percentage above 33% (if under 40 years old) may be considered overweight, while 39% or higher puts you in the highest risk category.

A typical healthy woman has a body fat percentage between 21 and 33% (23–34% if over age 40, or 24–36% if over 60).

Female athletes typically have a body fat of 14–20%, varying by sport.

Women typically carry about 10-12% of essential body fat. Falling below this can be dangerous.


, A fiberglass tape measure is the most accurate choice for body measurements. Steel tapes are difficult to bend around curved surfaces, while cloth tapes are easily stretched.Make sure your tape measure is accurate by holding it up to a ruler or yard stick.


, When you're measuring your body fat percentage with a tape measure, you'll need to know how to use it correctly to get the most accurate results.When taking measurements, make sure the tape measure makes contact with the skin. It should conform to your body.  Pull taut, but not so much that the tape makes an indentation in your skin.The most common cause of errors is using the measuring tape wrong or making inaccurate measurements.  


, Take each of the required measurements three times for the most accurate results:

Take each measurement in turn, not in groups. For example, men should measure neck, waist, height; neck, waist, height; neck, waist, height.


Take the average of all neck measurement, then all waist measurements, etc. Use these average values in the formula.

Take your height in meters and square the number.,
Divide your weight in kilograms by meters squared.,
Use an extended equation if your height is in centimeters.",How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI)1," You will need to multiply your height in meters by itself first. For example, if you are 1.75 meters tall, then you would multiply 1.75 by 1.75 and get a result of approximately 3.06., Next, you will need to divide your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. For example, if your weight is 75 kilograms and your height in meters squared is 3.06, then you would divide 75 by 3.06 for an answer of 24.5 as your BMI., You can still calculate your BMI if your height is in centimeters, but you will need to use a slightly different equation to do so. This equation is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in centimeters, then divided again by your height in centimeters, and then multiplied by 10,000.For example, if your weight in kilograms is 60 and your height in centimeters is 152, then you would divide 60 by 152, by 152 (60 / 152 / 152) for an answer of 0.002596. Multiply this number by 10,000 and you get 25.96 or about 26. The approximate BMI for this person would be 26.
Another option is to simply change your height in centimeters to meters by moving the decimal two places to the left. For example, 152 centimeters equals 1.52 meters. Then, find your BMI by squaring your height in meters and then dividing your weight by your height in meters squared. For example, 1.52 multiplied by 1.52 equals 2.31. If you weigh 80 kilograms, then you would divide 80 by 2.31 and your result would be a BMI of 34.6.

Aim to lose one to two pounds per week.,
Eat adequate protein.,
Fill up on fruits and vegetables.,
Consume two to three servings of carbohydrates daily.,
Consider protein supplements.,
Do cardio exercise three to five times per week.,
Perform weight training two to three times per week.,
Include enough rest days.,
Focus on proper fueling and recovery.",How to Burn Fat Without Losing Muscle," Safe weight loss is considered losing about one to two pounds per week.Losing weight faster increases your risk for muscle mass loss.It's generally recommended to never consume less than 1200 calories daily. Calories that are too low for your age, gender or activity level put you at risk for muscle mass loss as you're not consuming adequate nutrients for your body to function normally.Losing one to two pounds per week results from cutting out about 500 calories daily. Do not cut out more than this.

, When you cut out calories, you limit how much protein you can consume throughout the day. Not being able to eat adequate protein may also result in muscle mass loss.At a minimum, women need 46 g of protein daily and men need 56 g of protein daily. This is easily met when you consume a source of protein at every meal and snack. Do not consume less than this amount.Stick to high quality sources of protein such as lean red meat, poultry, seafood, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts or natural nut butter, eggs and low fat dairy.
One serving of protein is about 3-4 ounces or a cut of meat that's about the size of your palm or a deck of cards.

, Both of these food groups are fairly low in calories but high in nutrients and can provide extra bulk to your diet. This can help make a lower calorie meal plan more filling and satisfying.It's recommended to consume two to three servings of fruit daily and four to six servings of vegetables daily. To meet these recommendations, you'll most likely need to consume a fruit or vegetable at each meal.
One small fruit or 1/2 cup counts as one serving of fruit and one cup or two cups of leafy greens counts as one serving of vegetables..

, Following a lower carb diet can help you lose weight more quickly and lose more fat compared to low-fat diets or only low calorie diets.A low carb diet focuses on limiting how many carbohydrates you eat within a day. Depending on your diet, it could range from 60–200 g of carbohydrate daily. The fewer amount of carbs you allow in your diet, the more restrictive your food choices will be.
Carbohydrates are found in many food groups including: grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, dairy and legumes. Consume just one to three servings of these daily to support weight loss. Read packages or use a food journal to find out how many carbs are in the foods you're eating.
A low-carb diet with higher protein has shown the best potential for fat loss and maintaining muscle mass.Talk to your doctor prior to starting a low carb diet. While safe for the general healthy adult, following a low-carb diet might not be appropriate for everyone.

, Protein supplements are drinks that are moderately low in calories and high in protein. Getting another 15–30 g of protein daily from these drinks may help you meet your minimum protein intake, increase weight loss and prevent loss of muscle mass.Whey protein is a high quality protein for your body. It has all the essential amino acids your body needs and cannot make itself. If purchasing a protein supplement, try to purchase whey protein if possible.
If you have a whey allergy, or do not want to use whey, consider using another source of protein. Egg and soy protein are appropriate alternatives.
Protein supplements have been shown to be especially effective at maintaining and even building lean muscle mass when they are consumed after a workout.If choosing to use a protein supplement to help increase weight loss, make sure to pick a supplement that's not overly high in calories. Also don't mix a lot of ingredients or high calorie ingredients that increase your supplement's total calorie level. This may cause weight gain if it adds too many calories to your diet.
You can purchase protein supplements at a variety of stores. Look for them at a well-stocked grocery store, some pharmacies, health food stores, sports/nutrition stores or online.

, One key part of fat loss is exercise. Cardiovascular (cardio) or aerobic exercise helps your body burn calories and can support your weight loss.Maintaining the body’s lean muscle mass and burning calories can be accomplished by performing cardio exercise regularly.
Aim for about 150 minutes of cardio each week. Ideally, the exercise performed should be at moderate intensity. This is any activity that raises your heart rate and breathing to a level where it's still comfortable for you to say short sentences without stopping for a breath.Different types of aerobic activity can include: walking/running, biking, using the elliptical, swimming or dancing.
Interval training is a combination of strength training and cardio in short bursts of higher intensity exercises and moderate intensity exercises. You can do this type of activity for shorter amounts of time. Studies show that this type of activity helps support fat loss.;
, A crucial part to fat loss and muscle mass maintenance is strength training.Consistent weight training helps prevent muscle mass loss and can increase the amount of lean muscle mass.Strength training should be done for about 20–30 minutes per session.Try to work every major muscle group during each training. Make sure to work: core (back, abs and glutes), chest, arms and legs.
Strength training activities include: weight lifting, isometric exercises and classes like yoga or pilates.
If you're just starting out with weights or strength training, start with low weights and a few repetitions. Do not start out with overly heavy weights or train for long periods of time - this could cause injury.
Limit your training frequency for each muscle group to every other day at a maximum. Each specific muscle group should only be directly stimulated one to two times per week in order to allow for full recovery time., Taking a day or two off within the week will help your body recover and continue to maintain and build lean muscle mass. It's important to take off between both cardio and strength training throughout the week.


Allow for about 24–48 hours of time off between strength training sessions.When you take a ""rest day"" you should still be active. Rest days should not include a lot of sitting or laying down. You should perform very light intensity activity and restorative activity. You can do: walking, a leisurely bike ride, or restorative yoga.

, When you're dieting, working out and aiming to maintain or build muscle mass, it's important to focus on proper nutrition immediately before and after a workout.


Prior to a workout, it's ideal to consume a lot of hydrating fluids and also a small carbohydrate-rich meal. This should be eaten at least 30 minutes prior to your workout to make sure you don't have any GI upset during your exercise program.
Pre-work out snacks include: small bowl of oatmeal, small piece of fruit, individual yogurt or a serving of whole wheat crackers.
Immediately after a workout, it's also important to continue drinking hydrating fluids. In addition, you should consume a small meal or snack that contains protein and carbohydrate. This combination in particular helps muscles recover. Try to eat within 60 minutes of completing your workout.
Post-work out snacks include: hummus and whole grain pita chips, small apple and peanut butter, chocolate milk, trail mix with dried fruit and nuts, or a fruit smoothie with added protein powder.

Reduce your calories gradually.,
Vary your daily calories while reducing your overall average.,
Eat small meals more often.,
Eat breakfast.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Burn Fat1," Jumping straight into a low-calorie diet is a shock to your system. When you go cold turkey, your body has no idea what's going on — so as a protective measure it clings onto your fat stores. Instead, ease your body into the diet by cutting your calories gradually.Set a reasonable daily calorie goal that you can reduce to gradually. It might be 1,200 or 2,200 depending on your individual factors. Seek advice from your doctor, nutritionist, or dietician for guidance tailored to your needs.;
, Your body may adjust to a lower but steady calorie intake, meaning it won’t draw from your stored fat. To keep your body guessing and your metabolism up, try switching between higher and lower daily calorie intakes. This might help avoid that dreaded weight-loss plateau and improve your willpower.In other words, if you do a low-calorie diet all the time, your body may adjust its metabolic rate so you don't lose too much fat. But if you keep it on its toes, it won’t be able to regulate your fat stores as effectively.
This plan should still be paired with lowering your average daily intake gradually. Ask a doctor or nutrition expert you trust for their take on this type of diet plan.

, In simple terms, eating spurs your metabolism — the process by which your body turns food into energy. Eating more often, then, may kick your metabolism into a higher gear more times per day (e.g., if you eat six times a day, you get six “spikes”). But, you must make sure that eating more often does not also mean eating more; it’s essential that you reduce your overall average daily calories.Eating every two to four hours may work for you, for instance. If you've already finished lunch and it's been three hours, grab an apple, some yogurt, or some veggies.

, Burning fat is all about keeping your metabolism churning. And when you've been snoozing all night, it’s safe to guess that your metabolism has been snoozing too. So get up, brush your teeth, and eat breakfast. The more protein-packed and substantial, the better.Egg whites, low-fat dairy products, and lean meats should be on the menu regularly. Stay away from empty calories (doughnuts, calorie-laden fancy coffee drinks, etc.) and go with whole grain cereals and breads.

, Not only is adequate water consumption great for your skin, hair, and internal organs, it may also help you lose weight. Drinking water may, according to some research, on its own cause your metabolism to spike. And, at the very least, drinking water before a meal can help fill you up (and cause you to eat less).Drink water more frequently, and more overall per day. You'll be more hydrated, healthier, and your body won't be looking to cling onto those fat stores!

Check your leafy green vegetables for discoloration and odors.,
Check your asparagus for discolored tips.,
Watch for limp, moist green beans.,
Check your broccoli for limpness and discoloration.,
Notice if your carrots have become mushy or slimy.,
Monitor your cauliflower for brown spots and bad odors.,
Look for softer, lighter celery.,
Look for brown spots on your onions.,
Check your squash for leakage.,
Throw out green or bitter potatoes.",How to Check if Vegetables Are Spoiled1," Green vegetables will wilt after a couple days, especially if they're unpackaged. That is okay and doesn’t mean they are spoiled. Greens that are close to spoiling will start turning a yellowish color, become slimy, and have a foul odor.You can revitalize leafy greens by soaking their stems in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes. This does not always work, however, so if your leafy greens still look droopy after soaking, go ahead and toss them.;
, The state of your asparagus can be assessed by looking at the tip. The tip is usually the first part to go bad. It will turn dark green or black, and it will become mushy or slimy. If this happens, you can still eat the asparagus if you cut off the tips and just cook the stems.If the whole asparagus has turned dark green or black, throw it out and don’t eat it.

, Fresh green beans only last a few days, so keep an eye on them. Fresh green beans that are spoiled will be very limp and moist or slimy.Placing green beans in the fridge can extend their shelf life.
Cooked beans are spoiled when they give off a sour odor.

, Fresh broccoli stems are firm and the florets will be green. If the broccoli is going bad, the stem will be limp. The green color will start to become a shade of yellow. Generally, the smell will start to become stronger and slightly unpleasant., Fresh carrots can last over a month in the fridge. Baby carrots will last slightly less time because they have been peeled and have more moisture in the bags. Carrots that are bad will be mushy and slimy. If they are slightly limp or still hard, you can still eat them.Carrots will get white dots on them when they are dehydrated. This doesn’t mean they are spoiled. It just means they should be eaten soon.

, The head of a cauliflower should be white, purple, or light green, and the head should be spongy. Cauliflower that is going bad starts to develop brown spots. These spots can be cut off. If the head is white under the brown spots, you can still eat it.If the entire head is brown, if the cauliflower has a bad odor, or if it is slimy, you need to throw it out.

, Celery stores well in the fridge, lasting up to four weeks. Celery that is going bad turns a whitish color and hollows out. Individual stalks also start to spread from the rest of the bunch, and they are soft and bendy., Large onions, shallots, and heads of garlic can last up to two months in the fridge, while the smaller ones can last a couple of weeks. They can even last up to four weeks outside of the fridge. When onions start to spoil, they develop brown or black sports on them. They may also have areas that are soft or start to mold.You can cut out soft or moldy spots and check the surrounding area. If it isn’t soft or discolored, you can eat the onion.

, Squash will become bruised and mushy when it's spoiled. Winter squash can last a couple of months, while summer squash will only last for around a week. Any squash that is soft, mushy, slimy, or moldy has gone bad., Potatoes can have natural toxins that are resistant to cooking and high temperatures. If your potato has green sections on the skin, potato flesh, sprouts, or eyes, don’t eat them and toss them out.If your potato tastes bitter but doesn’t have green spots, you should also get rid of them.

Square your height in inches.,
Divide weight by height.,
Multiply that answer by 703.",How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI)2," To square your height, multiply your height in inches by itself. For example, if you are 70 inches tall, then multiply 70 by 70. Your answer for this example would be 4,900., Next, you will need to divide your weight by your squared height. For example, if your weight in pounds is 180, then divide 180 by 4,900. You would get an answer of 0.03673., To get your BMI, you will then need to multiply your last answer by 703. For example, 0.03673 multiplied by 703 equals 25.82, so your approximate BMI in this example would be 25.8."
"
Multiply your height in inches by 0.025.,
Square your last result.,
Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.45.,
Divide the larger number by the smaller number.",How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI)3," 0.025 is the metric conversion factor necessary to turn inches into meters. For example, if your height is 60 inches, then you would multiple 60 by 0.025 for an answer of 1.5 meters., Next, you need to multiply the last number you got by itself. For example, if the last number you got was 1.5, then multiply 1.5 by 1.5. In this situation, your answer would be 2.25., 0.45 is the metric conversion factor needed to convert pounds into kilograms. This will convert your weight into its metric equivalent. For example, if your weight is 150 pounds, then your answer would be 67.5., Take the number you got for your weight and divide it by the number you got for your squared height. For example, 67.5 would need to be divided by 2.25. The answer is your BMI, which in this example would be 30."

Calculate your BMI to determine if you are at a healthy weight.,
Use your BMI to see if you are a candidate for bariatric surgery.,
Track changes in your BMI over time.,
Calculate BMI before considering more expensive and invasive options.",How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI)4," Your BMI is important because it can help you to determine if you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.A BMI below 18.5 means that you are underweight.
A BMI of 18.6 to 24.9 is healthy.
A BMI of 25 to 29.9 means that you are overweight.
A BMI of 30 or greater indicates obesity.

, In some situations, your BMI may need to be above a certain number if you want to have bariatric surgery. For example, to qualify for bariatric surgery in the UK, you would need to have a BMI of at least 35 if you do not have diabetes and a BMI of at least 30 if you do have diabetes., You can also use your BMI to help you track changes in your weight over time. For example, if you want to chart your weight loss, then calculating your BMI on a regular basis might be helpful. Or, if you want to track growth in yourself or in a child, then calculating and tracking BMI is another way to do that.

, A person with a BMI under 25 is considered to have a healthy body weight. However, if you have a higher than normal muscle percentage, your BMI might be higher. In that case, a BMI higher than 25 may not necessarily indicate that you are overweight. If you are muscled, consider getting skin fold testing to determine whether you have too much fat.


Along with skin fold tests, underwater weighing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance are some of the other options available for determining your body's fat content. Just keep in mind that these methods are more expensive and invasive than calculating BMI."

Cut out bad carbs.,
Eat more lean proteins.,
Don't drink alcohol.,
Drink green tea and coffee instead.,
Go for fat-burning foods.",How to Burn Fat2," Fat is just stored food; in other words, it’s fuel for your body. Carbohydrates are your primary outside source of fuel, and your body can burn either carbs or fat just the same. So as long as you feed your body carbohydrates, it will not burn fat.However, cutting carbs alone may not help you shed fat, unless you are also cutting your overall calories as part of the process.
Remember that all carbs are not created equal (e.g., refined sugar and whole grains). There are okay carbs for you (the slow-burning kind like oatmeal and the ones in veggies); the bad ones are the simple sugars (think white things and candies).

, Protein and carbs contain roughly the same amount of calories per gram, but protein is not a preferred fuel like carbs. The protein is used as building blocks for muscle in your body and won't turn to fat. So make lean meats, fish, and soy a regular part of your diet.When you're packing on protein and saying no to carbs, your brain will send signals, which you interpret as hunger, before switching to ketosis (i.e., fat burning). After that, your hunger pangs should subside.
Eating a lot of protein is hard on the liver and kidneys, and there are other considerations for ""keto dieting."" It is not advised to consume zero carbs; just limit them, and stick to the good ones.

, Alcohol is full of empty calories (that is, bad carbs), and when you consume some, it's hard not to consume more. So while it's tempting to join in socially, refrain — or at least severely restrict yourself. After all, excessive drinking can make fat burning the least of your worries!If you absolutely must drink alcohol, keep it to one drink if you're a woman or two if you're a man. But that should only be a once-in-a-while thing, for the sake of your fat burning goals.

, Some studies have shown that 25 ounces of green tea or 16 ounces of coffee can spur an increase in your metabolism. Just make sure you don’t load up your cup with spoonfuls of sugar.Green tea and coffee seem to offer a wide range of possible health benefits, perhaps most notably the former’s antioxidant properties.

, Don’t focus only on the foods you can’t eat or should avoid whenever possible; there are many delicious foods that you can and should eat to keep your metabolism on the upswing. So stock up on foods like:Oatmeal
Lowfat or nonfat dairy (a little counterintuitive, but studies say that those who consume suggested amounts of dairy burn fat more easily than those who don't)Healthy fats, like nuts, avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish
Eggs (or, even better, egg whites)
Spicy foods
Grapefruit

Break up your workouts.,
Pair strength training with your cardio.,
Start a workout with strength training, then aerobic exercise.,
Try interval training.,
Give crosstraining a go.",How to Burn Fat3," Your metabolism spikes after every bout of physical activity. So if you can break up your hour workout into two half-hour chunks, you'll get two spikes instead of one. Your body burns calories at a higher-rate after a workout (sometimes for several hours after), and if you rejuvenate it later in the day, you'll further enhance the effect.This can be taken advantage of in small ways, too. Even two 15-minute walks can cause a boost. So, with both your meals and your workouts, try to go with smaller/shorter but more frequent.

, Doing cardio is great for you, but doing cardio and lifting weights is even better for burning fat. If you want the most bang for your buck, you should do both.Working with weights is important if you’ve cut back on calories. When you restrict your caloric intake, you risk losing muscle mass instead of fat. If so, you might shed some pounds and still not get the results you’re looking for.

, If you're doing both cardio and lifting weights, it's ideal if you do weights first and then do cardio — in other words, “firm then burn!” Doing so helps keep your post-workout metabolism up for longer — perhaps even all day.This order of exercise may also be easier for you to manage. Generally, pumping iron requires better form and technique. When you're tired from running or biking, it may be harder to lift weights with proper technique., This type of exercise routine can help you break up your workout without actually stopping your workout session. Interval training involves you going at an easy pace for a duration of time, and then going all out. You can also adjust the duration and pauses between the cycling back and forth. This can burn more calories and potentially increase your metabolism.The simplest example of interval training might be the treadmill. Walk for 30 seconds, then run full out for 30. Just 15 minutes of this is more beneficial than a 30-minute even-paced jog., Whatever your workout is — whether it's a 15 minute walk with the dog or a 10K through the park — your body gets used to it. You can actually burn fewer calories when your body is familiar with the level and type of exertion it’s experiencing. So to keep your body a bit off guard, try crosstraining. Consider it a good excuse to pick up that hobby you've been eying.


Crosstraining simply means doing a variety of exercise activities — running one day, swimming the next, biking the day after that. Mixing it up isn't only good for your body, though — it also does wonders for impending boredom!"

Stay off the scale if it helps your motivation.,
Find ways to reduce your stress.,
Get enough sleep.,
Get active in small ways.",How to Burn Fat4," When you lose fat, you don't necessarily lose muscle — and muscle weighs more than fat. So consider that number on the scale arbitrary — it's much more about how you look and feel.


That said, checking in on the scale at least once a week does seem to benefit long-term weight loss plans. So, don’t throw away your scale, but do find the frequency that works for you., People under excess stress tend to make less healthy food choices, and they may also burn fat more slowly. Excessive stress is bad for your skin, it's bad for your sleep, it's bad for relationships — it's just bad overall. So find a healthy way to get rid of it! You’ll feel better no matter how much it helps you in losing body fat.Many people find success in reducing stress through meditation and yoga. But maybe long walks in the park or listening to relaxing music will do the trick for you. Keep trying until you find what works.

, While everyone’s needs vary, plan to aim for around 7-9 hours a night. You may think that sleep would be counterproductive in losing fat, but properly rested bodies tend to process carbs more efficiently.Also, if you're not properly rested, you start craving sugar. Your hormone levels (cortisol, ghrelin, and insulin) go of out of whack and your body starts clinging onto fats and sugars left and right. Prevent this by getting the sleep you need.

, Even the slightest amount of activity is better than none at all. Studies show that fidgeters, on average, weigh less. Non-fidgeters are even more likely to store calories as fat. So in addition to cleaning the house, walking the dog, and parking on the far side of the parking lot, find time to fidget, if that’s your kind of thing!Little opportunities can always be had. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Go around the grocery store in the most inefficient way possible. Fake out your chair by not quite sitting down — that is, by doing squats. This stuff adds up without you even realizing it."

Discard vegetables that are covered in mold.,
Throw out vegetables that smell wrong.,
Get rid of vegetables that are slimy.,
Be extra careful with home canned vegetables.,
Keep track of how long you have had the fresh vegetables.,
Avoid tasting the vegetables to check them.",How to Check if Vegetables Are Spoiled2," Some mold can be beneficial, but mold on vegetables can make you sick. Mold can withstand high temperatures used to cook and the roots can extend down into the food and be invisible to the naked eye. Mold generally isn’t very toxic, but you still don’t want to eat it.If you want to try to save the vegetable, cut off the moldy section that goes around one in/2 cm deep.

, You can sometimes smell when a vegetable has spoiled. They may have a foul odor, or they may smell bitter, sweet, or sour when they normally do not. Though you cannot always smell when vegetables have spoiled, anything that has a bad smell should be thrown away., Vegetables should not be slimy and sticky. This indicates that it is spoiling and developing a film that contains bacteria. When you touch the vegetable and it feels sticky or slimy, throw it away., Home canning is a great way to preserve your vegetables. However, these vegetables are at a risk for botulism. Even if it smell or looks normal, it could be contaminated. The container can give you clues as to whether your vegetables are spoiled. If in doubt, throw it out.Containers that are leaking, bulging, or swollen should be tossed out. They should also be tossed if they have been damaged or cracked.
Home canned vegetables should not spurt liquid or foam when you open it.
Items with popped lids that haven’t been sealed properly should be tossed.
Throw away any containers with food that smells bad, is discolored, or is moldy.

, Most vegetables can last in the refrigerator for four to seven days. Some can last longer. One way to know if your vegetables are spoiled is to figure out how long you have had it. If the vegetables have been in the refrigerator for more than a week, they may be spoiled., If you think your vegetables have spoiled, don’t taste them to see if they taste okay. Just a taste that contains bacteria can make you sick. If it smells bad, looks moldy or rotten, or you are unsure, just toss the vegetables out."
"
Ignore bruising on most vegetables.,
Cut away discoloration of dark leafy greens.,
Remove small rotten sections.,
Eat vegetables that are wilted or wrinkled.",How to Check if Vegetables Are Spoiled3," Bruising commonly happens to vegetables. This can happen when you place it in a bag to bring it home or in the refrigerator. Bruises cause the vegetable to get soft and brown in a certain area. You can still eat the vegetable, but you probably want to remove the bruised section., Lettuce and dark leafy greens naturally may get brown spots on them or pink areas on the stems. This is all natural. Just cut off the discolored sections. The rest of the leaf is fine to eat.This discoloration may be caused by too much oxygen, a nutrient deficiency, or high temperatures.

, If your vegetables only have one small section that has become rotten, the rest of the vegetable is more than likely fine. Cut out the rotten section and check the rest of the vegetable. If the rest of it looks healthy, then you can eat it.Rotten spots, also called soft rot, can occur when the tissue of that particular spot is damaged, which makes it vulnerable to bacteria.

, Wilted greens or wrinkled skins don’t mean that a vegetable is spoiled. It means they have lost some moisture. Most of this wilting or wrinkling can be fixed if you place the vegetable in an ice bath or cook it."

Identify where you are going to measure skin folds.,
Hold the skinfold with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand.

,
Align the calipers perpendicular to the skinfold site and .25 inch (.635 cm) from the thumb and index finger.

,
Wait a few seconds after releasing the trigger to allow the needle to stabilize.,
Read the dial.,
Allow 15 seconds for the fat to relax back into its normal thickness.

,
Take a second measurement at each site.,
Calculate body density using the proper equation for the person's gender.,
Calculate the percentage of fat.",How to Check Body Fat With Calipers,"


For consistency, all measurements should be made on the right side of the body.
You may want to mark the location, because measurements should be repeated in the same place.
The 3 skinfold sites for men are chest, abdomen, and thigh.
The 3 skinfold sites for women are tricep, suprailiac, and thigh.
The abdomen skin fold measurement is taken 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bellybutton with the skinfold oriented vertically.
The chest skinfold measurement is taken halfway between the underarm and the nipple with the skinfold oriented diagonally.
The suprailium skinfold measurement is taken at the top of the hip bone with the skinfold oriented diagonally.
The thigh skinfold measurement is taken on the front of the thigh halfway between the hip and knee joints with the skinfold oriented vertically.
The tricep skinfold measurement is taken on the back of the upper arm midway between the shoulder and elbow.;
,,, You may take the reading as soon as the needle has stopped moving.

, Record measurements to the nearest .5 mm (.02 inch).

,,


Measurements at a single site should vary by less than 1 mm (.4 inch). If they do not, continue taking measurements until they do.

,


Take the sum of all 3 measurements. Call it S.
You will also need the person's age.
For men, the equation is Body Density = 1.1093800 � (0.0008267 * S) + (0.0000016 * S�) � (0.0002574 * age).
For women the equation is Body Density = 1.0994921 � (0.0009929 * S) + (0.0000023 * S�) � (0.0001392 * age).

Choose yogurts with minimal ingredients.,
Look for live and active cultures on the ingredients list.,
Opt for the right calcium content.,
Pay attention to added sugars.,
Be careful of fake fruit.,
Approach non-fat yogurt with caution.,
Stay away from heat-treated yogurts.,
Choose Greek yogurt for protein.,
Weigh the benefits of plain yogurt.,
Flavor yogurt on your own.",How to Buy the Healthiest Yogurt," The less it says on the label, the better. In general, yogurts that aren't loaded with added preservatives and sugar are best for your health. When you look at the ingredients label, you should only see a few things.The only three ingredients natural yogurt needs are milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. You should not see much more than this on the label.
Some yogurts may have a added sugar and fruit. These are normal ingredients; however, long lists of ingredients are indicative of an unhealthy yogurt.;
, Probiotics, which are good bacteria that help keep you healthy, are one of the main benefits of yogurt. When scanning a yogurt label, look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the yogurt's label. This indicates that the yogurt was not heat-treated, which removes probiotics from the yogurt., Another benefit of yogurt is that it's a huge source of calcium; however, not all yogurts have as high a calcium count as they should. Look for yogurts that have at least 15% of your daily calcium. Amounts vary from yogurt to yogurt. Some have as high as 35%, so if you're trying to get more calcium, look for calcium rich yogurts., Yogurt does contain some natural sugar. A small amount of sugar listed on the ingredients label should not be surprising; however, artificially flavored yogurts contain high amounts of sugar. Make sure to see how many grams of sugar your yogurt contains. High-sugar yogurts are not a health food.Whole milk generally naturally comes with 10 to 15 grams of lactose (a naturally occurring sugar) per cup. Greek yogurt has around 5 to 10. Flavored yogurt may contain more sugar, even when flavored with natural fruit.
In general, look for yogurt with less than 22 grams of sugar.

, Fruit can be a healthy addition to yogurt; however, some fruit in yogurt is really a mix of sugar, food coloring, and vegetable juice. If yogurt claims to contain fruit, check the label. Fruit should be one of the first items listed as an ingredient, before sugar or any preservatives. If you don't see fruit on the label, the fruit is probably fake., Fat in yogurt is not always a bad thing. Your body needs healthy fats to thrive. It's generally healthy to buy yogurt between 1 and 2% fat content. Be careful with low-fat yogurts, as lots of low-fat yogurts add flavor by adding a lot of sugar. Always check the label.If you choose low-fat yogurt, go for yogurt that's flavored with fresh fruit over sugar.

, Heat-treated yogurts remove much of the good bacteria from yogurt. Bacteria in yogurt is not bad, and things like probiotics make yogurt healthy. Heat-treated yogurt is generally not as healthy as other varieties. It should say somewhere on the yogurt's label if it was heat-treated.If you are lactose intolerant, be particularly careful about heat-treated yogurts. Lactose intolerant people have a hard time digesting heat-treated yogurts.

, If you're using yogurt for a protein boost, Greek yogurt is probably your best option. Greek yogurt tends to have higher protein and is also lower in sugar.However, Greek yogurt does not have that much calcium. Icelandic Skyr yogurt has both high protein and calcium levels. If you're looking to up your protein and calcium, go for skyr yogurt.
Many Greek yogurts have around 6 grams of protein per a 15 ounce container., Plain yogurt is usually the best nutrition-wise. It only has two ingredients and is not sweetened like other yogurts. While plain yogurt is more sour than sweet, you can mix it with things like fruit and granola or use it in smoothies.Things like blueberries, strawberries, mangoes, and other fruits can add flavor to plain yogurt.
You can also add plain yogurt to a smoothie, adding texture to the smoothie with yogurt while also throwing in fruits and green vegetables.

, While flavored yogurts have more taste, which can make for a better snack, the sugar content can be very high. If you want to add flavor to yogurt, it's healthier to buy plain yogurt and flavor it with natural ingredients.The best option is to add your own fresh fruit to yogurt. This keeps the yogurt natural and healthy.
You can also drizzle it with natural maple syrup or honey.

""Feed"" your eyes.,
Exercise your eyes.,
Rest and relax your eyes.",How to Improve Your Eyesight1," Eyes are just like any other part of the body – they need nutrition to function at an optimal level. Similar to other organs, a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and fatty foods will go a long way in maintaining healthy eyes.Vitamin A, C, an E, along with minerals like copper and zinc should be in your daily diet. These vitamins and minerals are essential for good vision and protection against disease. Eat strawberries, oranges, eggs, salmon, mackerel, and almonds for your vitamins, and oysters, crab, or turkey for your minerals.
Antioxidants such as beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin help protect your eyes from getting sun damage. You can find these antioxidants in dark leafy vegetables, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and carrots.
Garlic, onions, and caper should be in your diet to get sulfur, cysteine, and lecithin, which protect the lens of your eyes from forming cataracts.
Blueberries, grapes, and goji contain anti-inflammatory properties, such as anthocyanin, that will help improve your vision.
About 1,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per day will help prevent macular degeneration (AMD) and dry eyes. Salmon, mackerel, herring, flaxseeds, and walnuts are high in omega-3 fatty acids.;
, Exercising your eyes daily will help you maintain healthy eyes and optimal vision. Plan to exercise your eyes when you wake up, before going to bed, or when your eyes are fatigued. Make sure your hands are clean so that you do not irritate your eyes and your mind is relaxed before starting.Start simple. Roll your eyes in a circular motion clockwise ten times and then reverse it counterclockwise for another ten rolls.
Place your thumb (or a pen) six inches away from your nose and stare at it for five seconds. Then, five seconds on an object immediately behind your thumb. Try to do this ten times for about a total of two minutes. This is something else you can do at your desk quickly at work.
Rub your palms together for heat and then placing them against your eyes for five to ten seconds. Repeat this procedure three times to keep your eyes warm.
Massage your temples, forehead, and just below your eyes by using your thumb knuckles in a small circular motion for about twenty times in each area.

, Since you use your eyes every waking moment give them lots of rest and relaxation by taking breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep every night to fully rest, repair, and recover your vision. A lack of sleep will weaken your vision health.Shut down for about three to five minutes. Close your eyes and lean your head back while trying to clear your mind of thoughts.
Focus on an object that is twenty feet away for twenty seconds. This is the same test you are administered to check for 20/20 vision.
Try resting your eyes for at least ten minutes for every fifty minutes you spend in front of a computer screen, television set, or reading a book. Take a quick nap if necessary.
