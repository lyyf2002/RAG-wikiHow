Use artificial tears to keep your eyes lubricated.",How to Heal a Scratched Cornea," Sometimes scratches to the cornea are caused by small objects that get trapped beneath the eyelid, such as dust, dirt, sand or even an eyelash. Before you can start to treat the scratch, you must remove this foreign object. Try blinking several times in a row to remove the object. Closing and opening your eye can stimulate the lacrimal glands to produce more tears and wash the foreign body out of the eye.With your right hand, pull the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid of the affected eye. The lashes of the lower eyelid may brush the foreign object out of the eye.
Do not try to remove any trapped items with your fingers, tweezers, or any other object as this can make the eye injury worse.;
, If blinking didn't get the foreign object out of your eye, try rinsing your eye with water or saline solution. It's best to use a sterile or saline solution. Do not use tap water. Ideal properties for eyewash solution include a neutral pH of 7.0 and a temperature between 60°F and 100°F (15.5 to 37.8°C). Though this is anecdotally often suggested, do NOT administer the solution to your eye using a cup. If there is a foreign object in the eye, using a cup to pour water on it can cause the object to become further lodged in the eye. Follow these guidelines as to how long you should rinse your eye out:For mildly irritating chemicals, rinse for five minutes.
For moderate-to-severe irritants, rinse for at least 20 minutes.
For non-penetrating corrosives such as acids, rinse for 20 minutes.
For penetrating corrosives such as alkalis, rinse for at least 60 minutes.
Be sure to note any additional symptoms that may indicate that a poisonous solution has gotten into the eye, including: nausea or vomiting, headaches or lightheadedness, double vision or impaired vision, dizziness or loss of consciousness, rashes or fever. If you notice these symptoms, call poison control (800) 222-1222 and seek medical attention immediately.

, Another method of removing any trapped objects is to place some lubricating eye drops in the injured eye to flush it out. Lubricating eye drops can be purchased over-the-counter at the drugstore. You can put the eye drops in yourself or get someone else to help you. The correct method for using eye drops is described in Part 3 below.


Artificial tear drops are designed to lubricate eyes and keep them moist on the outer surface. They are available over the counter and are available in a wide assortment of brands. Some artificial tears contain preservatives to help keep the solution on the surface of your eyes for a longer period of time. However, these preservatives can irritate your eyes if you use them more than four times per day. If you need to use artificial tears more than four times per day, look for preservative-free artificial tears.Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose are the two most common lubricants in tear drops and can be found in many over-the-counter-solutions.
Trial and error is usually the only way to find the best brand of artificial tears for your particular eyes. In some cases, a combination of a few brands may be even be necessary. In the case of chronic dry eyes, artificial tears must be used even if the eyes are symptom-free. Artificial tears can only provide supplemental care and are not a substitute for natural tears.

, Once the foreign object has been removed, a lightly scratched cornea should heal on its own in a number of days. However, serious scratches or those that have become infected will require antibacterial eye drops in order to heal properly. See your doctor if any of the following occurs:


You suspect that the foreign object is still in your eye.
You experience any combination of the following symptoms: blurry vision, redness, substantial pain, tearing, extreme light sensitivity.
You think you have a corneal ulceration (open wound on your cornea), which is usually caused by an infection in the eye.
You have green, yellow or bloody pus coming out of your eye.
You notice light flashes or you visualize tiny dark objects or shadows floating around.
You have a fever.

, If you suspect you have injured your cornea, it's best to make an appointment with your eye doctor.The doctor will use a penlight or ophthalmoscope to examine your eye for trauma. Your doctor may also examine your injured eye using special eye drops with Fluorescein dye that make your tears yellow. This dye helps make your abrasion more visible under the blue light.To do this, a topical anesthetic is added to the eye and then your lower lid will be pulled down gently. A Fluorescein strip is then touched onto the eye, and as you blink, the dye spreads throughout the eye. Yellow stained areas under normal light indicated damaged corneal areas. Your doctor will then use a special cobalt blue light to highlight areas of abrasion and to determine the cause.Several vertical abrasions can indicate a foreign body, while branching stains can indicate herpes keratitis. Additionally, several punctuated lesions can indicate your contact lens as a cause.Your vision will be affected by this dye and you will see a yellow haze for a few minutes. You may also experience a yellow discharge from your nose during this time.

, If your scratched cornea is causing you pain, it's a good idea to take over-the-counter pain medications, such as those containing acetaminophen (Tylenol).Dealing with your pain is important, as pain causes stress to the body, which prevents the body from healing quickly and effectively.Always take pain medications according to the instructions on the packaging and never exceed the recommended dosage.

, Eye patches were traditionally used to help heal a corneal scratch, however recent medical studies have found that eye patches can actually increase pain and prolong healing. An eye patch hinders the natural blinking of the eye, thus straining the eyelids and producing pain. It also increases the tearing of the eye and this invites more infection and delays the healing process. An eye patch also decreases oxygen delivery, and the cornea is dependent on oxygenation., Nowadays, instead of an eye patch, your doctor will often prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) eye drops, used in combination with a soft, disposable contact lens. The eye drops are designed to decrease the sensitivity of your cornea. The soft contact lens is used as a bandage to protect your eye, speed up the healing process and reduce pain while it heals. Unlike with eye patches, this therapy allows you to see out of both of your eyes, all the while reducing inflammation. The most common prescribed eye drops and ointments include topical NSAIDs and antibiotics.Topical NSAIDs: Try Diclofenac (Voltaren), 0.1% solution. Put one drop in your eye four times daily. You can also try Ketorolac (Acular), 0.5% solution. Use one drop four times daily.See Part 3 for how to administer eye drops.Always follow the instructions and dosage outlined on the packaging.

Topical antibiotics: Try Bacitracin (AK-Tracin) and use 1/2-inch ribbon two to four times daily. Or use erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, applying a 1/2-inch ribbon. You can also use Chloramphenicol (Chloroptic), 1% ointment and give yourself two drops every three hours. Yet another option is Ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan), 0.3% solution, where the dosage changes over the course of the treatment. On the first day, administer two drops every 15 minutes for six hours, then two drops every 30 minutes for rest of day. On the second day, administer two drops per hour. From the third day to day 14, administer two drops every four hours. Always follow the instructions and dosage outlined on the packaging.

, Wearing eye makeup — such as mascara, eye shadow or eyeliner — can irritate the injured eye and prolong healing. Therefore, it's best to avoid wearing eye makeup until the scratch has completely healed., It's a good idea to wear sunglasses while you're dealing with a scratched cornea to protect your eyes from light sensitivity. Sometimes a scratched cornea will cause light sensitivity. You can protect your eyes from the light by wearing sunglasses with UV protection, even while indoors.If you are experiencing extreme sensitivity to light or spasms in your eyelid, your ophthalmologist may choose to give you eye drops designed to dilate your pupil. This helps to reduce pain and relax your eye muscles. See Part 3 on how to administer pupil dilating eye drops.

, Avoid wearing your contacts until your physician says it's safe. If you wear contacts regularly, it's recommended that you avoid wearing them for at least a week following the injury, until your cornea has healed completely.This is particularly important if the cornea scratch was caused by wearing contact lenses in the first place.
You should also not wear contact lenses while applying antibiotic treatments to your injured cornea. Wait 24 hours after your last dosage of antibiotics before wearing them again., Give your hands a thorough wash with antibacterial soap before putting in the eye drops. It is very important that you avoid introducing bacteria to the injured eye, otherwise you could cause an infection.

, Once open, discard the first bead of liquid. This is done to prevent any dirt or residue at the top of the dropper from coming in contact with the eye.

, The tissue will soak up any excess liquid that escapes from the eye. It's best to tilt your head backwards order to allow gravity to do its work and help the drop soak into the eye, rather than just drip out of it.You can administer eye drops while standing, sitting or lying down as long as your head is back.

, Look up and use the index finger of your non-dominant hand to pull down the lower eyelid of your injured eye. Squirt the eye drops into the lower lid.As to how many drops you should squirt into your eye, follow the directions on the bottle or your physician's advice. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
Wait a few minutes between drops if you need to put in more than one to make sure that the first drop gets absorbed and is not washed out by the second.
Make sure the tip of the dropper does not make any direct contact with your eyeball, eyelid or eyelash, as this can introduce foreign bacteria into the eye.

, Once the drops are in, gently close your eye and keep it shut for 30 seconds. You could even keep your eyes closed for up to two minutes. This allows the eyedrop solution to spread across the eyelid and prevents it from leaking out of the eye.Just make sure not to squeeze the eye too tightly, as this can squeeze the ointment out and cause injury to the eye.

, Using a soft cloth or tissue, gently blot around your eye to remove any excess solution., Unfortunately, once you have scratched your cornea once, you are more likely to injure it again. Therefore it's important to take certain preventative measures to protect your eyes from foreign objects and injury.For example, studies have shown that wearing protective eyewear can reduce the risk of getting an eye injury at your work by more than 90%.Consider wearing protective goggles (or at least glasses) during the following activities:Playing sports such as softball, paintball, lacrosse, hockey and racquetball.
Working with chemicals, power tools or anything that can splatter into your eyes.
Mowing the lawn and weed-whacking.
Riding in a convertible, on a motorcycle or bicycle.

, Wearing contact lenses for long periods of time can cause your eyes to dry out, making them more prone to injury. Therefore you should only wear your contact lenses for the specific amount of time recommended by your ophthalmologist.Try to plan out your day so that you are not stuck wearing your contacts all day. For example, if you run in the morning and know you want to go for a bike ride in the evening, wear your glasses all day in between those activities when working at your computer. Make a concerted effort to bring your glasses with you and change into them where appropriate.

, Use a product like artificial tears to lubricate your eyes even after your scratch has healed. Not only does this lubricate your eyes, but it also helps to flush out foreign objects (such as an eyelash) before they can scratch your cornea.

Determine how much you should be eating.,
Eat less.,
Reduce high-calorie foods.,
Eat foods that facilitate weight loss.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Burn Fat (for Men)1," Many people eat more calories than their bodies can use. When this happens, your body will store those calories for later as fat. An important first step in getting rid of unwanted fat, then, is to stop eating more than your body needs.


A simple way to figure out roughly how much you should be eating to reach your target weight is as follows: start with your desired weight in pounds, and multiply it by 12. Subtract 2 for every year older than 20 you are (most people's metabolism begins to slow down around then). Add 10 percent for the amount your body needs to maintain daily life functions. The final number is roughly the number of calories you should eat per day.For example, if you are a 34 year old man and want to get your weight down to 145, you'd do these calculations: 145 (desired weight) X12=1740. 2X14 (years older than 20)=28. 1740-28=1712. 1712X1.1 (for daily functions)=1883.2. You should be eating about 1883 calories per day.
Keep in mind that this is only a rough estimate. If you are an active person who exercises a lot, you may be able to eat more. If you live a fairly sedentary life, even this amount may be too much.;
, Once you know how much you should be eating, you can start reading food labels and tracking your calories. You can reduce your caloric intake in two ways: eating less, and eating better. Chances are, you'll need to do both. Below are some strategies for decreasing your overall food intake.


Use smaller plates. You can't put as much food on a smaller plate. When you've finished what's on the plate, wait 20 minutes before going back for more--it takes roughly that long for your brain to realize you are actually full.
Use blue plates. Believe it or not, some people believe the color blue suppresses your appetite.
If you snack between meals, eat snacks that take longer to consume, like peanuts in the shell. Or, eat with your non-dominant hand. Research shows this slows down snacking and can promote weight loss.Many have argued that it is better to eat several small meals throughout the day, rather than three large ones, as this gives the body a chance to process calories in small doses. Recent scholarship suggests, however, that this approach may actually make it harder to burn fat. The ""grazing"" approach keeps your insulin levels high, and in doing so may actually make it harder for your body to burn up fat cells., Steer clear of foods that are high in sugar, including high-fructose corn syrup. Sweet and starchy foods are loaded with calories.Sprinkling some cinnamon in your coffee or morning oatmeal is a good way to stabilize your blood sugar, which may reduce sugar cravings.
Replace high-calorie snacks like potato chips with lower calorie alternatives. Dill pickles, for example, make a great alternative to chips if you are craving a salty snack. A slice of pickle only contains one calorie!, There are several foods that actually promote weight loss by helping your body process fats or fending off cravings for more fattening cuisine.


Eat spicy food. Recent research suggests that eating chili peppers can lead your body to create ""brown"" fat cells, which actually burn energy, rather than the ""white"" fat cells that store energy and are produced by eating carbohydrate-rich foods.Eat healthy fats. People trying to lose weight often feel that they need to cut all fat out of their diets. The truth is, your cells need fats to be healthy, and fats help your body know when you've had enough to eat.So don't avoid all fat. Instead, avoid saturated fat, and instead try to eat foods rich in healthy fats, like avocados, walnuts, and olive oil.Eat calcium. When your body gets low on calcium, it sends hormonal signals telling it to store fat. Eating foods that are high in calcium, like low-fat Greek yogurt, will help to prevent this. Eat more vitamin C. High levels of cortisol, a hormone related to stress, also results in fat retention. Eating foods high in vitamin C, like oranges and kale, helps prevent cortisol spikes. It's great for your immune system, too!, If you're dehydrated, your body may feel more hunger, leading to more food cravings.


Water also takes up room in your stomach. Have a big glass with every meal, and you may not want to eat as much.

Calculate your body mass index (BMI).,
Measure your waist with a tape measure.,
Use calipers to measure body fat.,
Measure your bioelectrical impedance.,
Get a DEXA scan.,
Get weighed underwater.,
Get a near-infrared interactance (NRI) reading.",How to Calculate Body Fat Percentage Accurately," BMI is a useful measure to determine if you're overweight or obese and at risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems.It's calculated from your height and total body weight, so it's only a general estimate of body fat in relation to other tissues in your body. To obtain your BMI number, divide your weight (converted to kilograms) by your height (converted to meters). Higher numbers represent greater risk of disease. Normal BMI measurements range from 18.5 – 24.9; a BMI between 25 – 29.9 is considered overweight, whereas 30 and above is considered obese and at high risk.


BMI measurements are applicable for most men and women, but it does have some limits: it tends to overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have muscular builds; and it underestimates body fat in the elderly and others who have lost muscle.You can derive a more specific body fat percentage estimate using your BMI in the following equation: (1.20 x BMI) + (0.23 x Age) - (10.8 x gender) - 5.4. The gender number for males is 1 and for females is 0.;
, Measuring waist circumference with a tape measure also helps screen for possible health risks (mentioned above) that come with being overweight or obese.More specifically, if most of your fat is around your waist (termed belly fat) rather than lower at your hips, then you’re at a higher risk for cardiovascular and various other diseases. To correctly measure your waist, stand up wearing just your underwear and place a tape measurer around your lower abdomen, below your bellybutton and just above your hip bones. Breathe in and then measure your waist just after you fully breathe out.


When measuring waist circumference, apply the tape so that it makes contact with the skin and conforms to the body, but does not compress the underlying soft tissues.
Waist sizes greater than 35 inches for women and greater than 40 inches for men represent greater risk of disease.
The U.S. Navy method incorporates waist, hip, and neck circumference along with height and weight to determine an estimation of body density and fat percentage., The caliper method (also called skinfold or pinch test) involves pulling your subcutaneous fat away from your muscles at certain points and pinching it with measuring calipers. These measurements are then converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation — some formulas require only three body measurements, others require as many as seven. Although the caliper method doesn't give an accurate reading of actual body fat percentage, it's a reliable measure of body composition change over time if the test is done by the same person and technique (only a 3% error). Although, measurement error is higher for very lean and obese people. You can be calipers and have a friend or family member measure you, or get the test done at a fitness club, health clinic or hospital.


It's very important when doing the caliper test to use fixed pressure on all the points you measure.
Ideally, have a trained professional do your skin caliper measurements to ensure accuracy.
Skinfold-based body fat estimates depend somewhat on the type of caliper used and technique. As well, it measures only one type of fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat under the skin)., Bioelectrical impedance is a method of measuring the fat composition of your body, in comparison to other tissues, by its resistance to electricity.Fat tissue does not conduct electricity, whereas muscle and bone tissue do (albeit poorly). As such, you're measuring how low levels of electricity flow through your fat tissue versus the other tissues in your body. Bioelectrical impedance is reportedly about 95% accurate depending on your body's water content, which fluctuates with exercise, diet, sweating, hydration and use of alcohol or drugs. This method does not require specialized personnel and the equipment is not expensive to buy — most gyms and physical therapy offices have them to use for free.


You can either stand barefoot on metal plates that send an electrical current through your body (it looks similar to a regular weight scale), or grip a hand-held device (with both hands) that does the same thing.
To get the most accurate results, don't eat or drink for 4 hours prior to testing; don't exercise vigorously within 12 hours; and no alcohol or diuretic (caffeine) consumption within 48 hours.

, For a very accurate determination of your body fat percentage, visit a facility that has a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanner. A DEXA scan involves x-ray technology that's used to estimate muscle tissue, bone mineral density and fat tissue in all regions of the body with a high degree of accuracy.It uses a combination of two x-rays to calculate body composition in various body segments, so you can see which part of your body holds the highest percentage of fat (or muscle). The scan imparts about as much radiation to your body as the TSA body imaging devices at airports, which is not very much. A DEXA scan is considered the gold standard of determining fat percentage in your body as a whole, as well as regional parts such as arms and legs.


Unlike MRI or CT scans, a DEXA scan doesn't involve lying inside a claustrophobic tunnel or enclosure. Instead, you lie on your back on an open table and an X-ray scanner passes slowly over your body — the procedure usually takes about five minutes, although it depends what part of your body is being scanned.
Most major universities (exercise physiology labs) and many healthcare facilities have DEXA scanners. Ask your doctor for a referral to one in your area. They were originally developed to measure bone mineral density. The cost ranges from $100-200 USD out of pocket if your health insurance plan doesn't cover it.

, Since muscle tissue and bone is much denser than fat tissue, determining body density is helpful for understanding body composition. With underwater weighing, you are submerged in a water tank and the amount of water that's displaced is measured, which is used to calculate tissue density and full-body composition of fat.The more water you displace, the more bone and muscle tissue you're assumed to have, so the lower your fat percentage. Underwater (or hydrostatic) weighing is a very accurate measure of body fat percentage — its error is only 1.5% if the test is performed according to guidelines.


The main downside to this method of measuring fat percentage is that you have to get wet and be submerged underwater for a few seconds once you completely exhale your breath.
Athletes often have denser bone and muscle tissue than non-athletes, so their measurements can underestimate body fat percentage using this method.
Ask you doctor or do an internet search about which medical or research facilities in your area do hydrostatic weighing — there may not be many. You may have to travel out of your area. The cost should be comparable to getting a DEXA scan.

, This method of measuring body fat is based on the principles of light absorption, reflectance, and near-infrared spectroscopy.To estimate body fat composition, a computerized spectrophotometer with a hand-held fiber optic probe is used. The probe is pushed against a body part (often the biceps muscle) and emits an infrared light, which passes through fat and muscle tissue towards bone and is then reflected back to the probe. Density measurements are obtained and incorporated into predictive equations (also taking into account your height, weight, and body type) to give an estimate for overall body fat percentage. This method is not as accurate as DEXA scanning or hydrostatic weighing, but it's likely a more accurate assessment of body fat percentage than you can get at home with calipers or bioelectrical impedance scales.


NRI tends to be less accurate with people who are either extremely lean (<8% body fat) or obese (>30% body fat).
The amount of pressure applied to the fiber optic probe, skin color and hydration levels may cause results to differ and be inaccurate.
NRI devices are widely available at many gyms, health clubs and weight-loss centers for a minimal fee, or sometimes free. Your doctor's or physiotherapist's office may also have an NRI device.

Increase your intake of Vitamin C. One nutrient that has been shown to help fight cataracts is Vitamin C. This particular vitamin is found in a wide range of foods and can be easily included into your diet.Recent studies have shown that a diet rich in Vitamin C may help reduce the development of cataracts or slow the progression of current cataracts.,
Incorporate more Vitamin E-rich foods.,
Get in adequate amounts of Vitamin A.,
Consume foods high in lutein and zeaxanthin.,
Drink green and black tea.,
Eat a balanced and varied diet.,
Include regular servings of healthy fats.,
Make half of your plates fruits and vegetables.,
Minimize saturated fats and sugar in your diet.,
Take a specific multivitamin for eye health.,
See your doctor regularly.,
Reduce your exposure to UV light.,
Stop smoking.,
Maintain consistent blood sugar levels if you have diabetes.",How to Help Fight Cataracts Through Diet,"
To boost your overall intake of Vitamin C, aim to include a Vitamin C-rich food at every meal and snack. You want to aim for 300 mg of Vitamin C daily. There are many foods to choose from which makes meeting this target fairly simple.
Try: oranges, yellow peppers, dark leafy greens (like spinach and kale), kiwis, broccoli, berries (like blueberries or raspberries), tomatoes, peas, papaya, grapefruit, pineapple and mango.;
, In addition to Vitamin C, other studies have showed that Vitamin E (a natural antioxidant) can also help slow the progression of cataracts.Vitamin E is a little trickier to find in foods, so plan out your meals wisely.


Studies have shown that Vitamin E can help prevent and slow the progression of cataracts. In addition, it helps support your immune system and can repair damaged cells (like those in your eyes).
Aim to consume about 400 IU of Vitamin E daily. You'll need to focus on including Vitamin E-rich foods in your meals to help you reach this amount.
Try: wheat germ, sunflower seeds, almonds, peanuts, peanut butter, sweet potatoes, avocado and corn oil.

, You may be aware that Vitamin A (sometimes referred to as beta carotene) is an important vitamin and nutrient for your eyes. Without adequate Vitamin A intake, your cataracts could worsen or progress more quickly.Studies have shown that those people who consumed adequate amounts of Vitamin A-rich foods (in addition to foods high in Vitamin C and E) showed less risk of developing cataracts and also a slower progression.
It's recommended to consume about 700-900 IU of Vitamin A daily. Research has shown that Vitamin A from foods is the best choice.
Try consuming more of: carrots, sweet potatoes, dark greens (like spinach and kale), pumpkin, yellow and red bell peppers, cantaloupe, apricots, salmon, broccoli, butternut squash, acorn squash and liver.

, Outside of vitamins and minerals, there are antioxidants. Both lutein and zeaxanthin are antioxidants that have been shown to have beneficial effects on eye health by slowing the progression of cataracts.Studies have shown that these two antioxidants (specifically in the family of carotenoids) are the only ones found in the eyes. Those who consumed adequate amounts had less need of cataract surgery and the progression of cataracts slowed.
Health professionals typically recommend consuming about 6 mg of a combination of both lutein and zeaxanthin daily to reduce the need for cataract surgery.
You can find these antioxidants in the following foods: eggs, green leafy vegetables (like spinach and kale), corn, peas, broccoli, green beans and oranges.

, Both green and black teas are known to have a variety of antioxidants (like catechins) and other beneficial nutrients. Recently, these same nutrients have also been shown to help slow down the progression of cataracts.One specific study showed that regular consumption of black and green teas were associated with not only preventing cataracts but also promoting the growth of new blood vessels in the eye and preventing macular degeneration.
Health professionals have not recommended a specific dosage of either green or black tea at this time.
Aim to drink at least one cup of either green or black tea daily. You can increase this amount to 2 or 3 cups if you enjoy this type of tea. Make sure to be mindful of how much sugar (or honey) you add as high quantities of sugar can affect your overall eye health.

, One important part of maintaining proper eye health is eating a balanced diet. Since it is a variety of vitamins and antioxidants that play a role in the maintenance of your eye, a balanced and varied diet is the best way to consume those important nutrients.A balanced diet includes foods from every food group each day. You should eat something from the dairy, grain, protein, fruit and vegetable group on most days.
In addition, it's important to eat a varied diet. That means eating a large variety of foods from within each food group within each week.
For example, don't only go for oranges. They are high in Vitamin C and lutein, but so are other fruits like kiwis, grapefruits, apricots and cantaloupe.

, Healthy fats, like omega-3 fats, aren't only for your heart and arteries. These nutritious fats have also been shown to maintain and improve your eye health.Studies have shown that healthy fats, like DHA, become concentrated in the retina and may prevent plaque from building up in addition to protecting the tiny blood vessels in your eye.
Health professionals have always recommended including a serving of healthy fats at least once during the week. However, to maintain eye health (and heart health), aim for a serving several times a week.
Foods that are high in healthy fats include: cold water fish (like salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring or sardines), walnuts, olives and olive oil, avocado and seeds (like chia and flaxseeds).
If you're planning to have a serving of fish, go for 3-4 oz. If you're having some avocado, measure out about 1/2 cup. For nuts, seeds and oils go for 1-2 tablespoons per serving.

, Like following a balanced and varied diet, it's important to make sure you're meeting the minimum intake guidelines for fruits and vegetables. These food groups in particular are full of nutrients that can maintain eye health.The vitamins and antioxidants that are best for preventing cataracts or slowing their progression are found in fruits and vegetables. Making sure you eat adequate amounts of these foods can help you meet the intake guidelines for those nutrients.
It's typically recommended to eat five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily or make half of your meals and snacks a fruit or vegetable.
Also fill up on fruits and vegetables that are dark or brightly colored. These foods have higher concentrations of those health boosting vitamins or antioxidants. Try foods like: dark greens, beets, blueberries, blackberries, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, kale, spinach, cherries or even pomegranate seeds. These are all high in a variety of nutrients.

, Both saturated fats and high levels of sugar have been linked to a variety of health issues and chronic diseases. Although not commonly known, eating fatty foods or sugary sweets can increase your risk of developing eye related health problems.One specific issue of high fat or sugary foods is that when eaten regularly, they can increase your risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. Both of these chronic diseases can increase your risk of a variety of eye-related health problems.Aim to limit or avoid foods like: fatty cuts of meat, full fat dairy products, fried foods, fast food, sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cakes/pies, breakfast pastries, ice cream and sugary cereals.

, In addition to having a well balanced diet and focusing on foods rich in Vitamin A, C or E, you may want to consider taking a MVI formulated for eye health. These are easy to find and can help you maintain your eye health.


Always talk to your doctor before starting any type of supplements. Even a MVI should be discussed with your doctor.
Look for a MVI that has at least 100% of your daily needs for Vitamin A, C, E and zinc. Those that are designed to maintain eye health may also have added omega-3 fats or lutein and zeaxanthin.

, Unfortunately, cataracts are a progressive eye disease. Without proper care and treatment they can progress quickly and lead to blindness. Make sure that you're following up regularly with your physician to manage your cataracts.


Discuss your prognosis and treatment options with your physician. You may be able to hold off on surgery and manage your cataracts with a proper diet and supplementation.
Talk to your doctor about your current diet and any supplements that you're taking. Ask if there are any specific changes your doctor suggests.
Also ask if they recommend a specific MVI or vitamin supplement for eye health or if they sell them in their office.

, UV light from the sun can be very damaging to your body. Not only can it causes skin cancer and lesions, it can also cause damage to your eyes - like cataracts.Make sure when going out you avoid squinting your eyes from the sun or glare. If you are, you need to get out of the sunlight.
Anytime you go outside and it's sunny or there is a glare, make sure to wear UV/UVA protected sunglasses. These are designed to filter out harmful rays.
If you don't have sunglasses or need extra protection, wear a hat with a wide rim or bill to also keep sun out of your eyes.

, Although not diet related, smoking is another risk factor you can change so you can decrease your risk of developing cataracts or progressing current cataracts to a more advanced stage.Many studies have linked smoking to an increased risk of cataract formation (in addition to many other chronic health conditions).
When you quit smoking, studies have shown a decreased risk for developing cataracts in addition to a slowed progression of current cataracts.
If you currently smoke, quit immediately. Either join a smoking cessation program, see your doctor for medication or quit cold turkey.

, Cataracts are a common and early complication of diabetes, and blood sugar levels have a direct impact on their development. To fight cataracts, it is essential that you work with your doctor to keep healthy, consistent blood sugar levels."

Check your visual acuity to determine if you will need prescription eyewear.
Get screened for glaucoma, which is damage to your optic nerve. If left untreated, it will get worse over time.

, You might need glasses to improve your vision if you have either nearsightedness or farsightedness. In both cases, corrective lenses will either counteract the increased or decreased curvature of your cornea or the length of your eye.Eyeglasses are the most accessible and safest rout to correct problems caused by vision impairment. You can get a range of eyeglasses: bifocals, trifocals, progressive lenses, reading and driving glasses.
Contact lenses are a popular choice as well. They are worn directly on your eyes and come as hard, soft, extended wear, disposable, and rigid gas permeable and bifocal.
The most important factors in choosing eyeglasses or contact lenses are safety and lifestyle choice.

, There are several different types of surgery to choose from if you prefer not to get corrective lenses. These surgeries have become routine over the past two decades and are considered relatively safe for fully developed eyes. A doctor uses a laser to reshape the cornea.A laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery removes layers from your cornea and is repositioned to help you attain your desired level of vision. It is painless, immediate, and does not require a long recovery period.
A laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) is a procedure that reshapes the cornea’s outer layers and changes its curvature to improve vision. Compared to LASIK surgery, LASEK surgery takes longer to recover from, may be more painful, and is more complicated in post-surgery recovery, but still a very successful procedure.
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is similar to LASEK surgery, but instead of the cornea it’s the epithelium that gets reshaped. Recovery includes wearing a bandage contact lens for a few days.
An intraocular lens (IOL) implant is surgically implanted into the front of the eye’s lens. Implants are not a popular treatment option at this time.
Conductive keratoplasty (CK) uses radiofrequency energy to apply heat to the cornea. The biggest drawback to this procedure is that the results are not permanent.
Side effects of refractive surgery include visual side effects, under or overcorrection, dry eye, infection, cornea scarring, and vision loss.

Adjust the lighting.,
Improve air quality.,
Choose the right glasses.,
Limit computer usage.",How to Improve Your Eyesight3," Keep the room you are in softly lit. Fluorescent lighting is considered bad for eyes since they give off the wrong light frequencies of color and emit radiation that makes you drowsy all day long.When reading, try to keep your light source located behind you and keep the light directed on the paper or the task you are working on.
At work, or at a desk, use a shaded light source positioned on the desk in front of you. Again, keep the light directed towards your work and the shade will protect your eyes from direct light from the source.
Avoid watching television or working on the computer in the dark.

, Dry eye is caused by a lack of lubrication and moisture on the surface of your eye. Problems can range from minor irritant to serious inflammation of the tissues of the eye.Use a humidifier to moisturize your house or workspace.
Adjust your thermostat to reduce air flow and dust particles that might irritate your eyes.
Move your desk or office space if it is near a vent. Request moving to a different area of the office.
Quit smoking because it can inflame your eyes. Consider stopping if you develop a dry eye condition.
Use artificial tears if necessary to keep your eyes moist and lubricated.

, Invest in the correct glasses or contact lenses for your specific situation. Nowadays, eyewear is made for nearly every situation so make sure to get a proper eye exam and talk to your optometrist about getting the correct prescription for the most likely environment where you will be wearing your glasses.Prescription and nonprescription lenses are made for nearly all types of lifestyles. There are different types of lenses for age, sports, and indoor and outdoor wear.
If you work outside or have to drive long distances make sure to buy polarizing sunglasses to protect your eyes again UV light and glare. This will help prevent squinting.
Make sure you wear glasses for as long as you need to and keep them clean.

, Computers are a major source of eye strain for most people. Try to limit your screen time by routinely taking breaks, exercising your eyes, and keeping them hydrated.If you tend to stare when you use a computer remind yourself to blink often in order to produce tears that moisten and refresh your eyes.
While you are on the computer practice the 20-20-20 rule: Every twenty minutes look at something twenty feet away for at least twenty seconds.
Reduce glare on the screen to avoid straining your eyes. This means you should adjust lighting in front and behind you.
Keep the monitor positioned directly in front of you at about arm’s length away. The screen should be approximately just below your eye level. Adjust your chair if necessary.
Use the convenience of a paper holder so you can keep your eyes relatively on the same level as the computer screen. Reducing the amount of times your eyes have to readjust will lessen eye strain.
Enlarge the font size, contrast, and brightness for easier reading and browsing.
Keep your screen clear from dust.

Get active every day.,
Join a gym.,
Do cardiovascular exercise.,
Train with weights.,
Do intervals.,
Target stubborn areas.,
Stick with it.",How to Burn Fat (for Men)2," To burn fat, it's important to get as much exercise as you can. Most people, however, don't have time to visit the gym every day. So, look for places in your daily routine where you can burn a few extra calories. Every little bit helps!


If your work allows it, walk around while you're doing things in the office. Take a walk on your lunch break.Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Bike to the office. Look at yard work as an opportunity to get some extra exercise in. Whatever works for you is fine, as long as it gets you to spend less time sitting and more time moving., The specialized equipment that gyms have will let you get more out of your workouts than you could just running around the block. Many gyms also offer classes or individual training programs to help you stay motivated.


Visit as often as you can, and try to get in a routine. Three days a week is a great goal if you have time.

, Core exercises like crunches are great for building up your abdominal muscles, but to burn up the fat underneath, you'll need to cardiovascular workouts like running, bicycling, swimming, etc. Anything that gets your heart rate up is burning calories.Keep up the pace. While any cardiovascular workout will burn calories, a high-intensity, fast paced workout will cause the release of growth hormones, which trigger the use of fat cells as fuel, and raise your metabolism for hours after the workout is over, extending the fat burn., Lifting weights and similar strength training not only builds muscle and burns fat, it also improves your sensitivity to insulin, helping your body process glucose more efficiently and store less of it as fat.Mix up which areas you are exercising, alternating between upper- and lower-body exercises. This will allow you to exercise all your muscles efficiently, without as much downtime in between sets.Try to target high intensity activity before low intensity activity and repeat a number of times during your workout. This will insure you maximize fat burn by following the biological sequence.
You can get the most out of your weight training and cardiovascular workouts if you mix them up as well. Some studies have suggested that doing some lifting a few minutes before a jog or bicycle ride will increase the calories you burn during the cardiovascular workout.Some people suggest interspersing short bursts of cardiovascular exercise throughout a strength training workout. For example, you can set down the weights to do sprints after 15 minutes of lifting, then return to your weights for another 15 minutes, and so on.Don't start too heavy. Lift weights that you can pick up comfortably, without straining yourself too much, and work your way up to larger weights. Otherwise, you may hurt yourself.

, Intervals are exercise routines that involve periods of intense exercise, followed by short rest periods. By keeping the level of intensity high, your body is forced to burn more oxygen than it takes in. To compensate, your metabolism will increase and remain high for a period after your workout is complete, so that your body can assimilate a greater amount of oxygen.Like a high-speed cardiovascular workout, this helps keep the fat burning going after the workout ends.
The most effective interval activities are those that exercise the whole body in a single exercise, like jumping jacks, lunges, hitting a tire with sledgehammer, and jumping rope. All of these should be done as quickly as possible. After a few minutes of activity, take a one minute rest, then do another interval., Once you've been doing a general exercise routine for a few weeks, you'll probably notice some areas of your body are shedding fat (or developing muscle) faster or more easily than others. At this point, it's a good idea to develop specialized routines to focus on the areas where the fat is taking longer to burn away.Some people find it's even a good idea to dedicate different days of the week to exercising certain areas. For example: Monday, focus on your arms and chest, on Tuesday, focus on your core, and on Wednesday, focus on your back and legs.

, Keeping to regular exercise regimen takes a lot of willpower, but to burn the fat and keep it off, you have to keep exercising and keep eating right.

Prepare for surgery.,
Have a vitrectomy.,
Recover from surgery.,
Stay in position.,
Use an eye box.,
Wear a shield and patch.",How to Heal a Detached Retina1," As with other retinal surgeries, you will be required to abstain from eating or drinking anything for between two and eight hours before the procedure. You may also be instructed to use eye drops to dilate the pupils before surgery., In a vitrectomy, your doctor will remove the vitreous fluid from inside the eyeball, and will remove any tissue that may be preventing the retina from healing. Your doctor will then fill the eye with air, gas, or liquid to replace the vitreous, allowing the retina to reattach and heal.This procedure is the most commonly-performed type of retinal surgery.Over time, the substance (air, gas, or liquid) your doctor injected is absorbed by the eye, and your body will produce fluid that will fill the vitreous cavity. If your doctor used silicone oil, however, he will need to surgically remove the oil after several months have passed and the eye has healed., After a vitrectomy, your doctor will send you home with specific care instructions for your eye to help ensure a full recovery. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully, and ask him if you're uncertain of what to do. Your doctor may instruct you to:


Take a pain reliever, like acetaminophenUse prescription-strength eye drops or ointments, After a vitrectomy, most patients are instructed to keep the head stable in a specific position. This is known as ""posturing,"" and it is vital to allow the bubble to settle into the correct position.It can also be helpful in maintaining the eye's shape after surgery.Follow your doctor's instructions on posturing to allow the retina to heal.Do not travel by airplane until the gas bubble is fully absorbed. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to fly again.Having gas bubbles in the eye may cause complications in other surgeries. Let your doctor know about the gas bubbles before any subsequent surgeries, and before being administered general anesthetic, especially nitrous oxide., Your doctor may give you an eye box to help your eye heal. He will instruct you on how to use the eye box, and will let you know how long to continue using it.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling any eye equipment.Soak cotton balls in the prescribed eyewash solution.Loosen any crust that may have formed on your eye, then wipe gently from the inside of your eye across to the outside. If you are treating both eyes, use separate cotton balls for each eye., Your doctor may give you an eye patch and an eye shield to help your eye heal. These tools will help you protect your eye while sleeping and whenever you are outdoors.Wear the eye shield for at least a week, or for as long as your doctor instructs you to continue use.The eyepatch will help protect your eye from bright lights, like the sun, and will help prevent dirt and debris from entering your healing eye."

Determine which kind of pink eye you have.,
Know when to call the doctor.,
Try allergy medicine.,
Clean the infected eye regularly.Whenever drainage begins to build in your eye, you need to wipe it away to prevent bacteria from festering.,
Apply over-the-counter eye drops.,
Use a cold or warm compress.,
Remove your contacts.,
Prevent the condition from spreading.,
Use prescription eye drops.,
Try an antibiotic eye ointment.,
Ask about antiviral medications.",How to Get Rid of Pink Eye Fast," Conjunctivitis can occur due to viruses, bacteria, and allergies. All types of pink eye cause the eyes to become red, watery, and itchy, but the other symptoms of pink eye will vary according to its cause.Viral can affect one or both eyes, and individuals with this condition may experience sensitivity to light. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious and difficult to treat. It usually needs to run its course, which can take anywhere from one to three weeks. The best way to treat viral conjunctivitis is by preventing complications from arising.
Bacterial conjunctivitis causes a sticky discharge, yellow or green, located in the corner of the eye. In extreme cases, the discharge can cause the eyes to stick together. One or both eyes can be affected, and bacterial conjunctivitis is contagious. Bacterial conjunctivitis is best treated by a doctor. You might be able to overcome the illness at home, but antibiotics will significantly shorten the duration.
Allergic conjunctivitis is usually accompanied by other allergy symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose, and both eyes will be affected. It is not contagious. Allergic conjunctivitis is usually treated at home, but patients with severe allergies may need professional medical treatment to clear the condition up quickly.;
, It never hurts to call the doctor when you have pink eye, since your doctor will have good recommendations for what to do. A call is strongly recommended if the pink eye is accompanied by more worrisome symptoms.Call the doctor if you experience moderate to severe pain in the eye or if you experience vision problems that do not clear up once the discharge is wiped away.
If pink eye deepens in color to an intense red, you should seek medical help as soon as possible.
Contact the doctor immediately if you suspect that you have a severe form of viral conjunctivitis, such as one caused by the herpes simplex virus, or if you are immuno-compromised due to HIV infection or cancer treatment.
Contact your doctor if bacterial conjunctivitis being treated with antibiotics does not improve after 24 hours.

, For mild allergic conjunctivitis, an oral over-the-counter allergy medication may be enough to clear your symptoms within several hours to a few days. If it doesn't go away quickly, it's probably bacterial or viral.


Try an antihistamine. The body reacts to allergens by producing chemicals called histamines, and these chemicals are the culprit behind pink eye and other allergy symptoms. An antihistamine reduces these levels or blocks the histamines completely, thereby stopping your symptoms.Use a decongestant. While decongestants do not stop the allergen from affecting you, they do control inflammation. In doing so, they can help prevent eye tissue from getting inflamed.

,


Wipe the eye starting at the inside corner, next to the nose. Gently pass over the entire eye toward the outside corner of the eye. This wipes the discharge away from your tear ducts and safely out of your eye.
Wash your hands before and after cleaning your eyes.
Use a clean surface for each wipe or pass to avoid getting discharge back in the eye.
Immediately discard tissues or disposable eye wipes. Toss any washcloths into the laundry immediately after use.

,""Artificial tears"" can relieve symptoms and flush the eye out.


Most over-the-counter eye drops are mild saline lubricants designed to replace tears. They can soothe dryness associated with pink eye, and they can also wash the eye of contaminants that could complicate and prolong viral, bacterial, or allergic conjunctivitis.
Some over-the-counter eye drops also contain anti-histamines that are useful in treating allergic conjunctivitis.

, Soak a soft, clean, lint-free cloth in water. Wring it out to remove excess water and apply it to closed eyes using gentle pressure.


Cold compresses are usually best for allergic conjunctivitis, but warm compresses might feel better and reduce swelling in the even of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis.
Note that warm compresses do increase the risk of spreading the infection from one eye to the other, so you should use a clean compress for each application and a different compress for each eye.

, If you wear contacts, you should remove them for the duration of your pink eye. Contacts can irritate your eyes, causing further complications, and may trap bacteria causing bacterial conjunctivitis in your eye.


Disposable contacts might need to be discarded if they were used at all while you had bacterial or viral conjunctivitis.
Non-disposable contacts should be cleansed thoroughly before you reuse them.

, Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are both contagious, and you can be reinfected after becoming well if the illness has spread to other members of your household.


Do not touch your eyes with your hands. If you do touch your eyes or your face, wash your hands immediately afterward. Also, wash your hands after applying eye medication.
Use a clean washcloth and towel every day. Change your pillowcases daily for the duration of the infection.
Do not share any products that touch your eye. This includes eye drops, towels, linens, eye cosmetics, contacts, lens solutions or containers, or handkerchiefs.
Do not use eye cosmetics until you get rid of the pink eye completely. Otherwise, you could reinfect yourself with those cosmetics. If any eye make-up was used when you had pink eye, discard it.
Stay away from school or work for a few days. Most people with viral conjunctivitis can return after 3 to 5 days, once symptoms start to improve. Most people with bacterial conjunctivitis return after symptoms vanish or 24 hours after treating the symptoms with an antibiotic.

, While over-the-counter eye drops are effective for many people suffering with pink eye, prescription eye drops are more powerful and may rid you of the illness sooner.


Treat bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotic eye drops.Antibiotic eye drops are a topical treatment that attacks the bacteria directly. They usually clear the infection within several days, but you should notice improvement after the first 24 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions concerning application.
Treat allergic conjunctivitis with antihistamine or steroid eye drops. While some antihistamine eye drops can be purchased over-the-counter, stronger versions are available by prescription. Severe allergies are sometimes treated with eye drops containing steroids, as well.

, Antibiotic ointment is easier to apply than eye drops are, especially for children.


Note the ointment blurs vision for 20 minutes after being applied, but the patient's vision should clear up after that time passes.
Bacterial conjunctivitis should be gone after a few days with use of this treatment.

, If your doctor suspects that your viral conjunctivitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, he may decide to put you on some form of antiviral medication.


Antiviral medications may also be an option if you have certain preexisting health conditions that have weakened your immune system.

Pick up the curler as you would a pair of scissors. Open up the curler and bring it to the base of your eyelashes with the curve of the curler facing up and away from your face.
Once the curler is around the base of your eye lash, close it lightly and pulse the grip in and out. Gently twist the curler upward to create the curl in your eye lashes. Hold it there for several seconds, before slowly pull the curler up the length of your lash, gently squeezing in a pulsing action;
, Although many men are shy about doing anything to their eyebrows, it is often important to be proactive with them, especially if they are too large and unruly. Try to find a groomer who has experience working with men—don’t assume that they will be able to handle you, just because they do a good job with your significant other.


Generally you should groom your lashes with tweezers instead of a waxing. Wax will make the lines look too abrupt, sharp, and artificial., Simply taking an eyebrow brush and brushing them upward and outward toward your temples can do a lot.Without using makeup, brushing can still make your lashes look fuller and give them a streamlined appearance., There are a number of popular treatments that require you to place a household edible on top of your eyes for about 10 minutes. Thinly sliced cucumbers or Granny Smith apples will help reduce puffiness around your eyes.Similarly, slices of potato can be used to eliminate dark circles around your eyes.


To ensure that your skin tone around your eyes remains even, do the potato treatment twice a week., Eye drops, which are available at most convenient stores, can be used to eliminate redness from fatigue, allergies, or drugs.


Refrain from using alcohol and drugs, because they can create redness in eyes.

, Eye creams are applied to the skin around the eye. They have many of the same anti-aging qualities that other moisturizers have, but also contain ingredients that rectify conditions specific to the skin around your eyes. They will, for example, help prevent puffiness, while keeping the skin smooth and bright. Like other moisturizers, they will also help suppress the appearance of wrinkles., Eyes often get puffy, sore, or dull because of insufficient sleep. Eight hours is generally a good standard for how much sleep you should aim to get at night, but requirements vary somewhat with age., Vitamins C, E, A, and Zinc all contribute to eye health. For more of these vitamins eat oranges, mangoes, strawberries, carrots, peaches, nuts, seeds, papaya, and spinach. For zinc, eat turkey, chicken, yogurt, and fortified cereals., Water keeps your skin hydrated, healthy, and young looking.Conversely, refrain from drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol will dehydrate you.Hydrating cream can also keep the skin around your eyes looking young, for much the same reason.

, Look after the delicate skin under your eye; don't use drying soap or rub abrasively. Use clean cotton balls and a non-abrasive cleanser to maintain your eyes., To maintain circulation, occasionally massage the skin around your eyes. Do small circles around the inner edge of your eye. Work your way out toward your temples, then down the side of your face to your jaw. Repeat for full effect., Quick-moving eyes can make you seem like you're trying to steal furtive glances. You will appear more confident if you slowly move your eyes in the other person's direction. Furthermore, s/he is likely to notice your eyes moving in that direction, increasing the likelihood that s/he will return your glance.


It is best if s/he has time to respond and look at you before you look at him/her. The other person's investment in you will be greater if s/he believes s/he has initiated contact., Looking people directly in their eyes is one of the most intimate things you can do. Two minutes of looking even a stranger in the eyes has been shown to inspire a feeling of passionate love. However, you should start off slow with someone you don’t know. Look at him/her for three to five seconds before breaking eye contact.Avoid glancing furtively from one eye to the other. Instead look directly center.Focus on people's faces and not their other features.

, As you look the person in the eyes, smile. This is an almost universal sign of flirting and it conveys positive intentions. Try to mean it; a genuine smile activates different muscles in your face than a fake smile, and a genuine smile is generally considered more attractive.Think positive and pleasant thoughts. Your eyes and smile reflect the way you feel.
To convey more emotion with your eyes, try an eyebrow raise while you smile., If s/he doesn’t look back at your or smile, there is a good likelihood that s/he is not interested in you. If s/he does, s/he probably is. After looking away for a bit, return eye contact and see how s/he responds. Go up and say “hello.”

, Maintain eye contact about 80% of the time as you talk. Be sure to look at the other person when s/he talks, so that you seem legitimately interested. Glance away when you make a joke or say something that could be perceived as bragging. Holding contact too closely during this point in the conversation could make it seem as if you are desperate for a reaction and thus not confident.


To keep things interesting while maintaining eye contact, move your head slightly from time to time. Move your chin up and down. Turn your head to the side and glance at him/her out of the corner of your eyes."

Continue to monitor the situation.",How to Get Stuff out of Your Eye," Even if your hands don't seem dirty, it's important to wash them if you're going to touch your eye. You don't want to remove an object from your eye only to infect it with something worse.


Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water for at least 20 seconds. This ensures that you don't get bacteria or other contaminants in your eyes. Eyes are quite vulnerable to damage and infection.Make sure you rinse all the soap off your hands so you don't get it in your eye.;
, Move your eye back and forth to locate where the object is. Move your eye from left to right, as well as from top to bottom. You may be able to see or feel the object.Looking in a mirror may be helpful if you can't tell exactly where the object is.
A bright light will help shed some light on the situation. Use it to make your inspection easier.
Turn your head left and right and tip it up and down to move your eye while looking at it in a mirror

, Have a friend or family member do the inspection for you if you are having trouble. Pull your own eyelid down and look up, slowly enough that the inspector has a chance to examine your eye.If this doesn't reveal the object, repeat, this time pulling your eyelid up and looking down to allow for inspection of your upper eye.
To examine underneath the eyelid, place a cotton swab right above the upper eyelid. Flip the lid over the cotton swab.This will allow you look for any object lodged in the eyelid itself.

, If you can't locate the object or can't remove it, call a doctor. Seek medical attention right away if you experience any of the following:You cannot remove the item from your eye
The item is embedded inside your eye
You experience abnormal vision
Pain, redness, or discomfort continues after removal of the object from the eye

, It is possible to get a toxic substance in your eye. This can have very serious health consequences. Call poison control at (800) 222-1222 and seek medical attention immediately if you experience any of the following:Nausea or vomiting
Headaches or lightheadedness
Double vision or impaired vision
Dizziness or loss of consciousness
Rashes or fever

, There are many commercially available eye washes that are ideal for removing objects from your eye. But if you don't have one on hand, you can make your own. The base of the mixture is salt and clean water.


Boil some water. Let it reach a full rolling boil and hold it at that temperature for one minute. Then, add one teaspoon of ordinary table salt for each cup of water.
If possible, it's better to use sterile, purified water rather than ordinary tap water. Tap water can contain more bacteria and additives than sterile water.
The goal of an improvised eye wash is to mimic the chemical composition of tears. The closer your solution is to the natural salt concentration (salinity) of your tears, the lesser the shock to your eyes. Tears are usually less than 1% salt by weight.

, Stir your mixture with a clean spoon to ensure the salt that you've added is well-dissolved. Stir until you no longer see solid salt grains at the bottom of the pot.


Since the water is boiling and you've added a relatively small amount of salt, it shouldn't take much stirring to dissolve it completely.

, Place your solution in a covered container and allow it to cool. When the solution reaches room temperature (or lower) it's ready for use.Never, ever use an eyewash that's still hot. You can seriously injure or even blind yourself by burning your eyes with hot water.
Cover the solution while it's cooling to ensure no new contaminants can get in.
Keeping the solution cool can give it a refreshing effect when you use it. But, don't use an ice-cold eye wash or one less than 60°F (15.6 °C). It can be painful and even slightly damaging to your eyes.
Even if you take extra care to keep your solution clean, be sure to throw it out after a day or two.Bacteria can be re-introduced to a solution after boiling.

, Administration of eye wash from a bowl is a good method for flushing eyes that have possibly been exposed to a contaminant, or if a foreign particle is lodged in eye.


Partially fill a bowl with sterile eyewash solution or lukewarm water between 60°F to 100°F (15.6 °C to 37.7 °C)in temperature.Do not fill the bowl to its brim as this will cause water to spill over.
Submerge your face in the bowl of water.
Open and rotate your eyes to ensure the whole surface of the eye comes into contact with the water. Rotate eyes in a circular pattern to help get the water in your eye. This will help remove contaminants.Remove your face from the water. Blink a few times to ensure that your eye gets an even coating of water.

, If you are unable to make or access a sterile eyewash, you can use ordinary tap water. This isn't ideal, but is often a better option than waiting to get or make eyewash. This method is especially appropriate if there is something painful or toxic in your eye.


Splash water into your open eyes as generously as you can. If your sink has an adjustable faucet, point it directly into your eye. Set it at a low pressure and a lukewarm temperature and hold your eyes open with your fingers.
Tap water isn't ideal for eye washing. It's not as sterile as the purified water used in many laboratories. But, if you get something toxic in your eye, it's far more important to rinse the chemicals away than to worry about possible infections.Water doesn't neutralize many chemicals. It just dilutes them and washes them away. For this reason, you'll need a large amount. The volume of wash should be at least 1.5 liters per minute (0.4 gallons per minute) for 15 minutes., Regardless of which approach you use to flush out your eye, there are some important guidelines to keep in mind about how long to wash.


The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recommends flushing your eyes with water for at least fifteen minutes.For mildly irritating chemicals, like hand soap or shampoo, rinse for a minimum of five minutes.
For moderate-to-severe irritants, like hot peppers, rinse for at least 20 minutes.
For non-penetrating corrosives such as acids, rinse for at least 20 minutes. An example of an acid is battery acid. Afterwards, call poison control and seek medical attention.
For penetrating corrosives such as alkalis, rinse for at least 60 minutes.Drain cleaner, bleach, ammonia, for example, are common household alkalis. Call poison control and seek medical attention., You can use a cotton swab to remove any object or substance that moves out of your eyeball while flushing. If the foreign object is no longer on the eye itself, it's okay to try to wipe it away.


Be careful not to wipe the eye itself with a cotton swab. The safest thing to do is to flush your eye with water, not try to scrape the object away with a swab.

, You can also remove an object from the white of the eye with a wet piece of tissue. If you see an object on the white of your eye or inside an eyelid, wet a tissue and touch the end of it directly to the object you want to remove. The object should adhere to the tissue paper.


This method is less recommended than flushing your eye with water. It will cause some irritation on your eye. This is common and not a cause for worry.

, It's common to feel a scratchiness or discomfort in your eye after you have removed the offending object. If you continue to feel discomfort for more than a day after removing the object, consult a physician., There are many precautionary measures to protect eye during the recovery process. These include:


Alerting and informing an eye care professional if new symptoms arise or if pain becomes unbearable
Following the advice of your eye care professional, if you consulted one
Protecting eyes from ultraviolet light or bright light by wearing sunglasses when outdoors
Avoiding the use of contact lenses until your eye has healed
Avoiding hand exposure to eye area and washing hands before touching eye area
Taking all prescribed medication as advised by your physician (he may prescribe an NSAID for the pain or antibiotics if you wear contacts, as this can make you susceptible to infection)

, If the situation gets better, no further action is necessary. If the situation gets worse, see an eye-care professional. Here are the signs to be on the lookout for after removing an item from your eye::


Blurred or double vision
Pain that continues or increases
Blood that covers part of the iris (or colored part of the eye)
Sensitivity to light
Other signs of infection such as discharge, redness, sores around the eye, or a fever"

Prepare for surgery.,
Undergo a pneumatic retinopexy.,
Recover from surgery.,
Use an eyepatch and shield.,
Apply eyedrops.",How to Heal a Detached Retina2," Prior to any surgery, you will be given specific instructions to prepare for surgery. Common preparations for surgery include:


Abstaining from food and beverages for between two and eight hours before the operationUsing eye drops to dilate the pupils (if instructed to do so by your doctor), A pneumatic retinopexy involves your doctor injecting a bubble of air or gas into the vitreous cavity of your eye. The vitreous is the gelatinous material that helps keep the shape of the eye.The bubble should land against the site of the tear and seal the retinal break.Once the site of the tear is sealed, it will no longer allow fluid to flow into the space behind the retina. The tear will heal with laser or freezing treatment.Your doctor will use laser or freezing treatments to create scar tissue in order to keep the retina firmly in place., After the surgery, your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for your eye. Until the gas bubble in your eye is fully absorbed, it may cause complications during future surgeries.


Let your doctor know about the gas bubble in your eye before being administered general anesthesia or being operated on.Do not travel by airplane until the gas bubbles in your eye are fully absorbed. Your doctor will let you know when it is safe to travel by airplane again., Your doctor may recommend that you wear an eyepatch when you leave the house to protect your eye from sunlight and dirt/debris. You may need to wear an eye shield while sleeping to prevent damage that could be caused by lying on a pillow., Your doctor will most likely prescribe you eye drops to help keep your eyes moisturized and free of infection during the healing process.Follow your doctor's instructions on applying eye drops and other medications."

Prepare for surgery.,
Have a scleral buckling.,
Recover from surgery.,
Use an Eye Box.,
Wear a shield and patch.",How to Heal a Detached Retina3," The same basic preparations will apply to all types of retinal surgeries. Do not eat or drink anything for between two to eight hours before the surgery (you doctor will advise you), and use eyedrops to dilate the pupils (if your doctor instructs you to do so)., In this procedure, your doctor will suture a piece of silicone rubber or sponge, called a buckle, to the white of your eye, which is called the sclera. The material sutured to your eye will create a slight indentation in the wall of the eye, thereby relieving some of the strain at the site of the detachment.In cases where there are several tears/holes in the retina or when the detachment is extensive and severe, your surgeon may recommend a scleral buckle that wraps around the entire eye.In most cases, the buckle is usually left on the eye permanently.Your doctor may use laser or freezing treatment to create scar tissue around the retina. This will help seal the seal the retinal tear/break to the wall of the eye, preventing fluid from detaching the retina., After a scleral buckling, your doctor will send you home with specific instructions on how to care for your eye and ensure a full recovery. Follow your doctor's instructions, and ask her questions if you're uncertain of what to do. Common post-operative instructions include:


Taking acetaminophen to relieve painUsing prescription eye drops or ointments, Your doctor may give you an eye box to help your eye heal. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling any eye equipment.Soak cotton balls in the prescribed eyewash solution.Lay the cotton balls across your eyelid for a few seconds to loosen any crust that may have formed on your eye.Gently wipe from the inside of your eye across to the outside. If you are treating both eyes, use separate cotton balls for each eye to avoid the risk of infection., Your doctor may give you an eye patch and an eye shield to help your eye heal. How long you wear these will depend on your doctor's recommendations.


You will most likely have to wear both the eyepatch and shield over the eye at least until your follow-up visit (usually the next day).You may need to wear the patch outdoors to protect your eye and shield the healing eye from direct sunlight. You can also wear dark sunglasses to help protect your eye while it heals.Your doctor may instruct you to wear the metal shield over your eye while you sleep for at least one week. This is to prevent injury to your eye, in case you roll over onto your pillow."

Give yourself rest time.,
Keep the eyes clean.,
Use eye drops.,
Adjust your vision prescription.,
Avoid driving or straining your eye.",How to Heal a Detached Retina4," For several days or up to a week after surgery, you will need time to rest and recover from the procedure. During this time you should avoid all strenuous activity, and avoid any activities that may cause strain or discomfort to your eye., After your surgery, you will need to keep the eyes as clean as possible until the retina is fully healed. To do this, your doctor may recommend:


taking extra precaution in the shower to avoid soap from entering the eyewearing an eyepatch or eye shield to protect the eyeavoiding touching or rubbing your eye, Many people experience itching, redness, swelling, and discomfort following retinal surgery. Your doctor will most likely prescribe eyedrops, or recommend over-the-counter eye drops, to treat these symptoms.Follow the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you for proper dosage.

, Some people experience blurred vision after retinal surgery, which can last for many months in some cases. This is typically the result of a scleral buckle changing the shape of the eyeball. If you experience blurred vision, your doctor may prescribe new glasses to correct the problem., Once you've completed retinal surgery, you will most likely be unable to drive a vehicle for several weeks. Many people experience blurred vision after undergoing retinal surgery, and you may be forced to wear an eyepatch for several weeks.While your eye is healing, your doctor will recommend that you avoid driving until your vision improves and your condition becomes more stable.Avoid watching television or staring at a computer screen for prolonged periods of time. This may cause eye strain that could further complicate your recovery time. You may also experience sensitivity to light after the surgery, and may find it difficult to look at electronic screens. Reading for prolonged periods may also be difficult."

, Be aware that certain groups of people experience floaters more than the rest of the population. Watch out for eye floaters if any of the following apply to you:


You’re nearsighted.
You’re between the ages of 50 and 75.
You’ve had cataract surgery.

, Be aware that all of these options carry risks, so most doctors won’t perform them unless absolutely medically necessary. Ask your doctor about these treatments if you have a dangerous underlying condition that is causing your floaters:


Vitrectomy Surgery. This procedure removes the vitreous gel from the middle of the eye. Laser treatments. This procedure breaks up eye floaters by the use of a YAG laser. Although some ophthalmologists have advocated this treatment option, there there is no evidence that this is both safe and effective."

Keep an allergy journal.,
Minimize your exposure to pollen or other allergens.,
Keep your house and car clean.,
Remove pollen from your body.,
Rinse your eyes with cool water.,
Rinse your sinuses.,
Take over-the-counter allergy medication.,
Get prescription medications.,
Get allergy shots.,
Use herbal remedies.",How to Get Rid of Itchy Eyes1," Allergies can be seasonal or year-round and can cause red, watery, itchy eyes as well as a runny nose, sneezing and coughing.Try to determine what is causing your allergies by keeping an allergy notebook. Record what symptoms you have, how long they last, and what you did that day. If you know what causes your allergies, you can always be prepared.


Make note if your allergies are worse after being outside, being in a dusty room, or playing with animals.;
, Avoiding what causes your allergies is the best way to prevent them, and pollen is a leading cause of allergies.Try basic lifestyle practices to minimize your exposure to pollen:


Plan outdoors activities for low-pollen times, like midday. Check the pollen count on your weather channel or online, and stay indoors when the pollen count is high. Stay indoors on very windy days.Protect yourself if you’ll be outside by wearing sunglasses, hats, and scarves to keep pollen out of your eyes and hair.
Mow your grass short and plant low-allergen plants in your garden. Ask your local plant nursery what’s best.
If the source of your allergies is another cause, such as cats or dust, try to minimize their presence in your life as much as possible.

, You can’t always avoid pollen, dust, and other allergens, so try to keep your personal spaces as clean as possible. Dust and vacuum your house every week, and vacuum out your car at least once a month. Keep your car and house windows closed.If possible, get a vacuum with a small-particle or HEPA filter.
Groom your pets every day – brush them on a wooden or tiled surface so you can vacuum up any hair and dander they leave behind. Wash your hands after touching your pets., Change your clothes at the end of the day and take a shower before going to bed – wash your hair for the best effect.Change your bedding at least once a week, and consider changing your pillow cases even more often.


Wear a face mask while cleaning or gardening., Stand over your sink or in the shower and rinse your eyes with cool water. Either splash the water onto your eyes or let the water run over your face. If it’s comfortable, try to open your eyes in the water to flush out any irritants.


You can also try soaking a clean cloth in cool water and using it as a compress. Squeeze excess water out then place the wet towel over your eyes.
Place two spoons in the fridge for about an hour, then place the spoons on your eyes to help bring down the swelling and relieve itching. Wash the spoons well before using them to eat.

, Use nasal irrigation with distilled, sterile saline to flush allergens from your sinuses. Get a squeeze bottle or a neti pot from your pharmacy or local health foods store.To irrigate your sinuses, tilt your head over your sink and pour the water or saline solution into your top nostril, and let it flush out your bottom nostril.


Use only water that’s been distilled, boiled, and cooled. Keep your neti pot or bottle clean so you don’t introduce germs into your sinuses.

, OTC antihistamines are the first choice for mild to moderate allergies. They come as pills, nasal sprays, and eye drops. Allegra, Zyrtec, and Claritin are common options. Be careful if you take an antihistamine pill – it may make you sleepy.OTC decongestants like Sudafed may help improve allergy symptoms as well, but will have less of a positive effect on your itchy eyes. Only use a decongestant nasal spray, like Afrin, for 2-3 days at a time.
Try cromolyn sodium nasal spray for allergy relief, or get a prescription for the eye drops (Crolom) to help relieve itchy eyes.
Many people get the most relief from taking a combination of medications; talk to your doctor or pharmacist about combining medicines to avoid over-medicating.
OTC eye drops can also help. Look for Naphazoline pheniramine, which is sold under the brand names Naphcon-A and Opcon-A; Olopatadine 0.1%, which is sold as Patanol; Lodoxamide tromethamire 0.1%, which is sold as Alomide; or Ketotifen 0.025%, also know as Zaditor., If your allergies are severe or OTC treatments don’t work, visit your doctor and ask about prescription allergy medications. There are a number of options your doctor can prescribe you, and they will help determine which is the best for you based on your symptoms and medical history. Some options include:Inhaled (nasal) corticosteroids like Flonase or Nasonex– these are safe long-term options with few side effects.
Montelukast (Singulair) is a prescription tablet that can help your allergies, especially if you also have asthma.
Ipratropium nasal spray (Atrovent).
Oral corticosteroids – pills like Prednisone can improve severe allergies, but can only be used for a short time due to side effects of prolonged use.

, If your allergies don’t improve with medications, talk to your doctor about allergy shots. You will get injections over 3-5 years to gradually get your body used to allergens. This can help improve your itchy eyes and other allergy symptoms for the long-term., Though there’s limited evidence proving they work, some people find allergy relief by taking herbal remedies. Discuss these options with your doctor, then find them at your pharmacy or local health food store. Consider trying one of the following for natural allergy relief:Extract of butterbur (only get products labeled “PA-free”)
Spirulina
Tinospora cordifolia
Capsicum
Honey
Vitamin C
Fish oil

Get crafty.",How to Get Rid of a Lazy Eye," Amblyopia occurs when the brain has difficulty communicating with the eyes correctly. It may occur when one eye has significantly better focus than the other. On its own, amblyopia can be difficult to spot because it may not present with any visual difference or deformity. A visit to the eye doctor is the only way to accurately diagnose a lazy eye.Strabismus is a very common cause of amblyopia. Strabismus is a misalignment of the eyes where one eye turns inward (esotropia), outward (exotropia), up (hypertropia), or down (hypotropia). It is sometimes known as a “wandering eye.” Eventually, the “straight” comes to dominate the visual signals to the brain, causing “strabismic amblyopia. However, not all lazy eyes are associated with strabismus.Amblyopia may also be the result of a structural problem, such as a droopy eyelid.Other problems in the eye, such as a cataract (a “cloudy” spot in the eye) or glaucoma, can also cause a lazy eye. This type of amblyopia is called “deprivation amblyopia” and usually must be surgically treated.Severe differences in the refraction between each eye can also cause amblyopia. For example, some people are nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other (a condition known as anisometropia). The brain will choose one eye to use and will ignore the other. This type of amblyopia is known as “refractive amblyopia.”Occasionally, bilateral amblyopia can affect both eyes. For example, an infant may be born with cataracts in both eyes. An eye care professional can diagnose and provide treatment options for this type of amblyopia.;
, Your child may not complain about her or vision. Over time, a person with amblyopia may become used to having better vision in one eye than the other. A professional eye exam is the only way to determine for sure whether your child has a lazy eye, but there are some symptoms you can look for.Becoming fussy or upset if you cover one eye. Some children may become fussy or upset if you cover one of their eyes. This could be a sign that the eyes are not sending equal visual signals to the brain.Poor depth perception. Your child may have trouble with depth perception (stereopsis) and may also have trouble seeing movies in 3-D. Your child may have trouble seeing distant objects, such as a chalkboard at school.
Wandering eye. If your child’s eyes appear misaligned, she may have strabismus, a common cause of amblyopia.
Frequent squinting, eye rubbing, and head tilting. These may all be signs of blurry vision, which is a common side effect of amblyopia.
Difficulty at school. Sometimes, a child may have difficulty at school due to amblyopia. Speak with your child’s teacher and ask whether your child is making excuses when asked to read from a distance (e.g., “I feel dizzy,” or, “My eyes are itchy”).You should ask your eye care professional to check for misalignment or vision problems in children younger than six months. At this age, your child’s vision is still developing so much that at-home tests may be ineffective..

, Test your child's response to movement to see if one eye responds more slowly than the other. Find a pen with a bright cap or a brightly colored object. Ask your child to focus on a specific part of the object (e.g, the pen cap, the “pop” part of a lollipop).Ask the child to focus on the same part of the object as he follows the colored object with his eyes.
Move the object slowly to the right and then to the left. Then, move it up and down. Observe the child’s eyes carefully as you move the object. You should note if one eye is slower than the other while following the object.
Cover one of your child’s eyes and move the object again: left, right, up and down. Cover the other eye and repeat the test.
Make note of how each eye responds. This will help you determine if one eye is moving more slowly than the other.

, If you believe that your child's eyes are misaligned, it can help to check by examining photographs of the eyes. Working with photos gives you more time to scrutinize the indicators that may signal a problem. This is especially useful for infants and young children, who may not keep still long enough for you to examine their eyes.You can use existing photos if they show the eyes in clear detail. If you don’t have any photos that are suitable, ask someone to help you make some new photographs.
Use the reflection from a small penlight to help rule out a lazy eye. Ask your assistant to hold a small penlight about three feet from your child’s eyes.
Ask the child to look at the light.
As the light is shining on your child’s eyes, take a picture of the eyes.
Look for symmetrical reflection of the light in their iris or pupil area.If the light reflexes are in the same spot on each eye, then your child’s eyes are likely straight.
If the light reflexes are not symmetrical, then one eye might be turned inward or outward.
If you're unsure, take multiple photos at different times to recheck the eyes.



, This test can be used with children who are six months or older. The cover-uncover test can help determine if their eyes are properly aligned and working in equal measure.Have your child sit facing you or have her sit on a partner's lap. Gently cover one eye with your hand or a wooden spoon.
Ask the child to look at a toy with the uncovered eye for several seconds.
Uncover the covered eye and watch how it responds. Check to see if the eye snaps back into alignment because it drifted away. This can indicate an issue that should be checked by a pediatric ophthalmologist.
Repeat the test on the other eye.

, A pediatric ophthalmologist is a medical doctor that specializes in children’s eye care. While all ophthalmologists can treat pediatric patients, doctors with a pediatric specialty are highly trained in various eye disorders in children.


Search online to find a pediatric ophthalmologist in your area. The American Optometric Association has a search feature that can help you locate an eye doctor in your area.The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus also has a doctor locator.If you live in a rural or small city, you may need to look in a nearby city to find a specialist.Ask friends and family with children for recommendations. If you know people who have children with vision trouble, ask them to recommend an eye doctor. This may give you a sense of whether that doctor will be right for you.If you have health insurance, make sure that you choose a provider who is covered by your insurance plan. If you aren’t sure, you can contact your insurance company to verify whether they will cover the eye doctor you’re considering., An eye care professional will assess your child’s eyesight and condition of the eyes themselves to determine if your child has a lazy eye.Understanding these will help you feel more comfortable during your visit. This will help you make your child feel more at ease as well.Retinoscopy. The doctor may use a handheld tool called a retinoscope to examine the eye. The retinoscope shines a light into the eye. As the beam moves, the doctor can determine the refractive error (e.g., nearsighted, farsighted, astigmatism) of the eye by watching the retina’s “red reflex.” This method can be very helpful in diagnosing tumors or cataracts in infants, too. Your doctor will likely use eye-dilating drops to examine your child with this method.Prisms. Your eye doctor may use a prism to test the eye’s light reflex. If the reflexes are symmetric, the eyes are straight; if they are not symmetric, the child may have strabismus (a cause of amblyopia). The doctor will hold the prism over one eye and adjust it to determine the reflex. This technique is not as accurate as some other tests for strabismus, but it may be necessary to use when examining very young children.Visual acuity assessment testing (VAT). This type of testing includes several types of exams. The most basic uses the familiar “Snellen chart,” where your child will read the smallest letters he can on a standardized letter chart.Other tests may include light response, pupil response, the ability to follow a target, color testing, and distance testing.Photoscreening. Photoscreening is used in pediatric vision exams. It employs a camera to detect vision problems such as strabismus and refractive errors by examining light reflexes from the eye. Photoscreening is especially helpful with very young children (under age three), children who have difficulty sitting still, non-cooperative children, or children with disabilities such as Nonverbal Learning Disorder or autism. The test usually takes less than one minute.Cycloplegic refraction test. This test determines how the eye structure displays and receives images from the lens. Your eye doctor will use eye-dilating drops to perform this test., Young children may feel frightened in new situations, such as a doctor visit. Telling your child what may happen during her eye exam may help soothe and reassure her. It may also help her behave appropriately during the exam procedures. When possible, ensure that your child is not hungry, sleepy, or thirsty when you take her to the eye doctor, as these things can make the child fussy and more difficult to examine.The doctor will likely use eye-dilating drops to dilate your child’s eyes. This will help determine the level of refractive error in her eyesight during exams.The doctor may use a flashlight, penlight, or other light tool to help him observe light reflexes in the eyes.The doctor may use objects and photographs to measure eye motility and misalignment.
The doctor may use an ophthalmoscope or similar equipment in order to assess if there is any eye disease or abnormalities in the eye., If your child does have vision problems, he will probably spend a lot of time at the eye doctor’s office (or what feels like a lot of time to a child). Children who wear glasses will need at least an annual checkup.Your eye doctor and child should have a pleasant rapport (way of interacting).You should always feel as though your child’s doctors care about your child. If the eye doctor you have initially chosen is not willing to answer questions and communicate with you, find another.You should not feel rushed or harassed by any doctor. If you had to wait an excessively long time, felt rushed through an appointment, or felt like the doctor considered you a nuisance, don’t be afraid to try out another doctor. You may find one who suits your needs better., After examining your child’s eyesight, the ophthalmologist can make recommendations about the appropriate treatments for your child. If the doctor has determined that your child has a lazy eye, therapies might include glasses, an eye patch or medication.


It is possible that the doctor will suggest eye muscle surgery to realign the eye muscles to their proper position. This procedure is done under general anesthesia. The child will be given general anesthesia. A small incision will be made on the eye and an eye muscle will either be lengthened or shortened, depending on how the lazy eye needs to be corrected. Patching may still be required., Once the cause of amblyopia has been determined, patching will usually be part of the recommended treatment to force the brain to start seeing with the weaker eye.For example, even if surgery has corrected vision issues such as refractive amblyopia, patching may still be required for a short time to force the brain to start recognizing visual signals it had previously ignored.


Ask for sample patches from your eye doctor. For patching to work, the patch must cover the eye entirely. Your eye doctor can ensure a proper fit.
You can usually choose an elastic-band patch or an adhesive patch.
The Amblyopia Kids Network has reviews of various eye patches, as well as information on where to purchase them., In the past, parents were advised to have their child wear the patch all the time, but more recent studies have found that children can improve their vision by wearing a patch for as little as two hours per day.Your child may have to build up to wearing the patch for the prescribed amount of time. Start with 20–30 minutes, three times a day.Gradually increase the time until your child wears the patch for the correct length of time every day.Older children and children with severe amblyopia may need to wear the patch for a longer period of time each day. Your doctor can recommend when and for how long your child should wear the patch.

, Patching can produce results within as little as a few weeks. However, it may take several months of treatment to see results. Check for improvement by retesting your child’s eyes monthly (or as recommended by your eye care professional).Continue to check for improvement monthly as the condition has been known to get better with treatments lasting six, nine, or 12 months. The response time will vary depending on the individual child (and how faithfully s/he wears the patch).Have your child wear the patch for as long as you continue to notice improvement., Getting your child's weak eye to work harder while the strong eye is patched will make treatment more effective.Initiate art activities that involve coloring, painting, dot-to-dots, or cutting and pasting.
Look at pictures in children's books and/or read with your child.Ask your child to focus on the details in the illustrations or to work through the words of the story.Be aware that your child's depth perception will be reduced because of the patch, so toss games may be extra challenging.
For older children, video games are being developed to coordinate children’s eyes. For example, software developer Ubisoft has been collaborating with McGill University and Amblyotech to produce games like “Dig Rush” that treat amblyopia. Ask your eye doctor whether this is an option for your child., Sometimes, treatments do not work as hoped. Your eye care professional is the best person to decide that. Children are often able to adapt to situations. Staying in contact with your eye care professional will keep you aware of whether new options may emerge for your child’s treatment., Atropine may be an option if your child is unable or unwilling to wear a patch. Atropine drops blur vision and can be used in the “good” eye to force the child to use the “bad” eye. They do not sting like other drops.Some studies suggest that eye drops are as effective or more effective than patches for treating amblyopia. Part of this effect may be because using the drops is often less socially stigmatizing for children than wearing a patch. Thus, children are more likely to cooperate with their treatment.These drops may not need to be used for as long as patching.Atropine drops do have possible side effects, so do not use them without first consulting with your child’s eye doctor., If your child’s amblyopia is refractive, flicker glass treatment may be an effective treatment alternative. Flicker Glass glasses resemble sunglasses. They work by rapidly alternating between clear and “occluded” (obstructed) at a frequency prescribed by your eye doctor. They may be a good choice for older children, or children who have not responded to other treatments.This treatment works best for children with mild to moderate anisometropic amblyopia (i.e., amblyopia caused by eyes with different strengths).
The Eyetronix Flicker Glass treatment is usually completed in 12 weeks. It is not likely to be effective if your child has previously tried patching to treat amblyopia.As with other alternative treatments, always consult with your child’s eye doctor before trying any treatment.

, RevitalVision uses a computer to stimulate specific changes in your child’s brain to improve vision. The computer treatments (40 sessions of 40 minutes, on average) may be completed at home.RevitalVision may be especially helpful for older amblyopia patients.
You will need to consult with your eye doctor to purchase RevitalVision.

, The eye area can become irritated or infected during patching. Keep an eye on your child’s eye area. If you see rashes or cuts around the eye, consult with your doctor or pediatrician on how to treat them.

, Both elastic band- and adhesive-style patches can irritate the skin around the eye and cause a slight rash. If possible, choose a hypoallergenic adhesive patch to reduce the risk of skin discomfort.Nexcare produces a line of hypoallergenic adhesive patches. Ortopad produces hypoallergenic patches in adhesive and glasses-fitting styles. You can also consult your child’s doctor for recommendations.

, If the skin under the adhesive part of the patch has become irritated, try covering an area around the eye that is larger than the patch with gauze. Attach the gauze to the child’s face with medical tape. Then attach the patch to the gauze.You can also try trimming away some of the adhesive part of the patch so there will be less of it touching the skin. The trick is to make sure that the normal eye is still completely covered and that the patch is secure., Since it won't come into contact with the skin, this style of patch prevents the problem of skin irritation. This could be a choice if your child has very sensitive skin.A patch that attaches to glasses can provide good coverage over the weak eye. However, you may need to attach a side panel to the glasses to prevent your child from trying to see around the patch.

, Wash the area around the eye with water to remove any traces of the irritant that may remain once the patch is removed. Use emollients or moisturizers on the affected area to help keep the skin moist. These will help the skin repair itself and help protect against future inflammation.


Skin creams or ointments may reduce inflammation, but it's important to follow instructions carefully and not to overuse these products. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing and simply allow the skin to ""breathe.""Check with your physician for advice on treating your child's skin irritation.

, In order to make eye patch treatment successful, your child must keep it on for the prescribed amount of time. It'll be easier to get her to agree to this if she understands why she needs the patch.Explain to your child how it can help her and what might happen if she doesn’t wear it. Let your child know that wearing the patch will make her eyes stronger. Without frightening your child, let her know that not wearing the patch could cause result in worsened vision.
If possible, let your child have input in scheduling her ""patch time"" each day.

, Communication is the key to helping your child feel comfortable with patching. Children who feel self-conscious or embarrassed about wearing an eye patch are less likely to stick with the treatment successfully.


Ask the people around your child to empathize and encourage him to stick to his course of treatment.
Let your child know that he has several people he can turn to with any problems. Be open to answering questions your child may have. Let your family and friends know about the reasons for patching so they can support your child too.

, If your child must wear the patch during school time, explain the situation to the child’s instructor or caregiver.Discuss having the teacher explain to classmates why your child is wearing the patch and how they can be supportive. Make sure that the school officials and faculty are aware that teasing over the patch should not be tolerated.
Discuss whether academic accommodations can be made for your child while she is wearing the patch. For example, ask whether teachers can give your child difficult assignments a little earlier, provide tutoring, offer a work plan, and/or check in with the student’s progress every week or so. These can all help your child feel more comfortable during patching and maintain good performance in school.

, Despite your best efforts, other children might tease your child or make hurtful comments. Be there to listen, soothe and reassure your child that this treatment is temporary and worthwhile.You could consider wearing an eyepatch in solidarity. Even if it’s just occasionally, your child may feel less self-conscious if he sees that adults can wear patches too. Offer eyepatches for dolls and stuffed animals too.Encourage your child to see the patch as a game, rather than as a punishment. Even if your child understands that the patch is for a good reason, he may see it as a punishment. Point out that pirates and other cool figures wear eye patches. Suggest your child compete with himself to keep her patch on.
There are several children’s books that deal with patching. For example, My New Eye Patch, A Book for Parents and Children uses photographs and stories to explain what it will be like to wear an eye patch. Reading about others’ experiences may help normalize patching for your child.

, Come up with a plan to reward your child when she wears the patch without complaints or difficulties. Rewards can help your child stay motivated to wear the patch. (Remember, young children don’t have a good sense of long-term rewards and consequences.)Post a calendar, chalk board or white board to keep track of your child's progress.
Give small prizes like stickers, pencils or small toys when she has reached a certain benchmark, such as wearing the patch every day for a week.
Use rewards as a distraction for very young children. For example, if your child pulls off the patch, replace it and give the child a toy or other reward to distract from the patch.

, Every time your child puts the patch on, the brain needs about 10 to 15 minutes to adjust to having the strong eye covered.Lazy eye occurs when the brain ignores the vision pathway from one eye. Patching forces the brain to recognize those ignored pathways. This experience can be scary for children who are not used to it. Spend time with your child to comfort him.Do something fun during this time to help make the transition easier. Creating a positive association between the patch and a pleasant experience may make it easier for your child to handle the patching process., If the patch is the adhesive type, let your child decorate the outside of the patch with stickers markers. Get a doctor's advice about the best decorations to use and how to apply them safely (you may not want to use glitter, for instance, as it could flake off and get in your child's eye).Never decorate the inside of the patch (the side that faces the eye).
Design websites such as Pinterest offer a variety of ideas for decorating. Prevent Blindness also has suggestions on how to decorate patches.Consider hosting a decoration party. You can give your child’s friends novelty eyepatches to decorate. This may help your child feel less isolated during the patching experience.

Get enough sleep.,
Use moisturizer under your eyes.,
Try an eye mask.",How to Get Pretty Eyes Without Wearing Makeup1," One of the main reasons people have dark circles under their eyes is lack of sleep. Make sure that you get eight uninterrupted hours. Keep your bedroom dark so that it’s easy to fall asleep and stay asleep., This helps to keep the skin soft. You might want to try a specific under-eye moisturizer that is specially formulated for that sensitive skin beneath your eyes. Some contain caffeine, others contain collagen -- both ingredients can help reduce the bags under your eyes.Moisturizers are the surest way to hydrate your skin -- drinking more water has been proven not to be effective at getting more moisture to your skin., Cooling eye masks can help shrink those under-eye bags. Figure out what works best for you. There are a number of choices that you can do at home, including


Cucumber slices cut in thin slices and placed on your eyelids
Tea bags from caffeinated tea cooled and drained, then placed on your eyelids
Chilled metal spoons, taken from 10-15 minutes in the refrigerator and then placed on your eyelids"

Don't touch your eyes.,
Take out any contact lenses.,
Know how long the symptoms might last.",How to Get Pepper Spray Out of Eyes1," Pepper spray is an oil-based substance which causes severe irritation to your eyes and skin. If you get pepper spray in your eyes, resist the temptation to touch your face or rub your eyes. Touching your face will just spread the oil around and increase the affected area.Don't touch your face, but do tear up your eyes by blinking a lot.
Blinking produces liquid that helps start the process of flushing the spray residue from your eyes.;
, If you are wearing contact lenses when you get pepper spray in your eyes, take these out immediately. The spray residues will stick to the lenses and continue to irritate your eyes. Throw the lenses away. Even cleaning them will not remove the residue.After taking out your lenses, submerge your face in cool, clean water.
Open and close your eyes underwater several times.

, Even if you manage to flush out your eyes, the symptoms may persist. Irritation to the eyes can continue anywhere from 30 minutes to over two hours. Inflammation of the throat lining can also cause breathing difficulties for up to an hour.


If your symptoms are particularly severe or last longer than this, you should go to a hospital or walk-in centre.
If you have asthma, pepper spray can cause serious breathing difficulties and you should get emergency medical treatment.

Do your research on eye drops.There are many different types of eye drops, each one recommended for different circumstances.,
Consult your eye care professional.,
Use a cold compress on your eyes.,
Use ice or freeze-packs.,
Wait out a burst blood vessel.If you sneeze or cough too hard, or even just rub your eye vigorously, you can cause a blood vessel to burst.,
See a doctor if you have pink eye.Just like its name says, pink eye (also known as conjunctivitis) causes your eye to look pink or red.,
Determine the cause of your eye redness.,
Reduce the amount of time you look at screens.,
Adjust your electronic screens.If you have a job for which you have to use a computer or watch TV, you may not be able to reduce your screen time.,
Avoid smoking.Irritants like smoke bother your eyes and cause unnecessary redness.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Eat a balanced diet.The food you eat can impact your eye health, along with the other organs in your body.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Manage your allergies.",How to Get Rid of a Red Eye," For example, if you have red eyes and wear contact lenses, a blood vessel constricting drop may not work. It wouldn't be able to get through the lens to treat your redness.


Most eye drops work by constricting the blood vessels in the eyes. By making the blood vessels smaller, they reduce eye redness. Be careful of using these too much because your eyes may get dependent on them. Eventually if you don't use them, you'll get rebound redness which makes your eyes red just because it is craving the constricting agents.Preservative free eye drops tend to be the most natural for you eyes. They come in single vial uses which makes them very hygienic.;
, The best way to choose the right drops is to talk to you a specialist about the cause of your redness. Let him or her diagnose you and choose the best treatment method.


If your redness is due to allergies, look for eye drops with antihistamines. Antihistamines can also cause eye dryness/redness, so you can couple these drops with artificial tears.
If you have an infection, see your doctor for prescription eye drops that have antibiotics.
Be careful with ""bacteria-fighting"" eye drops. Many people have an allergic reaction to the preservatives in them. You might make your eyes even worse!

, Cold water will decrease the swelling that causes bloodshot eyes, and will also soothe on your irritated eyes. You can just splash some cold water onto your face.


The most common cause of red eyes is allergies. The body releases histamines that dry the eyes, causing blood vessels to swell.Cold water reduces blood flow to the eyes and treats some of this inflammation.

, Using ice is another common and effective way to soothe bloodshot eyes.Ice and freeze packs work the same way cold compresses do, by relieving swelling and reducing the amount of blood flow to the eyes.


If you don't have a freeze-pack, place some ice cubes in a clean washcloth. Hold it over your eyes for 4 to 5 minutes.
When using extremely cold products like ice or a freezer-pack, always protect your eyes with a thin cloth towel. This prevents ice burn.

, Doctors call this ""subconjunctival hemorrhage."" In most cases, only one eye will be affected, and you won't feel any pain. The blood vessel should heal itself naturally. It can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks.


This can also occur if you are taking any blood thinners, doing heavy lifting, are constipated, or engaging in any activity that increases pressure to the head. It can also happen if you have a blood disorder. So if it occurs frequently, visit your eye doctor. Blood tests may be needed.
See a doctor if you have any pain, or if you have a chronic disease like diabetes.

, Speak with your doctor immediately if you think you have pink eye. He or she can prescribe antibiotic eye drops or even oral pills, depending on the cause. Pink eye is contagious, so wash your hands with antibacterial soap, clean contact lenses well, and don't rub your eyes. To make sure you have pink eye, check the following:


The dryness and redness is only in one eye, or at least began for the first few days as one-sided before spreading.
You recently had a viral or bacterial infection (i.e. ear infection, cold or flu)
You've been around someone who had pink eye recently.

, See an eye specialist for a professional opinion on why your eyes are red and irritated. Be able to provide answers to the following questions to help him or her make an accurate diagnosis:


Is this a chronic problem or is this the first occurrence?
Do you have any symptoms other than red eyes?
How long has this particular occurrence been present?
What medications do you take? Include any vitamins or supplements.
Do you drink alcohol or use any drugs?
Do you have any chronic diseases?
What allergies do you suffer from?
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
Have you been sleeping enough?
Are you eating less, or do you feel dehydrated?

, Studies show that our blinking rate decreases 10-fold when we're staring at screens.Blinking is important to eye health because it keeps our eyes moisturized. Staring at laptops, TV monitors, and other electronic screens can cause your eyes to dry out and redden. If you have to look at screens for extended periods of time, take these precautions:


Consciously remind yourself to blink.
Follow the 20-20 rule: every twenty minutes, take a break from your screen and do something else for 20 seconds to a minute. Give your eyes a little breather.
Lower the brightness on your screen.
Place the screen 20-40 inches away from your eyes., You can still make small adjustments to lessen the burden on your eyes.


Place the screen somewhere it is level with your eyes. You don't want to be looking up or down at the screen.
Leave a distance of about 20-40 inches (50-100 cm) between your eyes and the screen.
Wear eyewear design to fight eye strain from the glare of light off the screen. If you wear prescription lenses or glasses, ask your eye care expert if the time you spend looking at screens calls for a new prescription. Consider a tint or anti-glare coating to reduce the strain on your eyes.

, Smoking also increases your risk for a variety of eye diseases, including cataracts, macular degeneration, uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and dry eye syndrome. Smoking while pregnant can even cause infant eye disease in an unborn child.


If you're unwilling or unable to quit smoking, make sure to smoke outside to keep your house smoke free. You can also purchase air cleaners to keep your home smoke-free if you smoke indoors.

, Drinking too much alcohol dehydrates the body.You lose nutrients important for tear production through increased urination. The combination of dehydration and nutrient loss causes dryness and redness in the eyes.


Use a drink calculator to figure out if you're drinking more alcohol than you should.When drinking alcohol, drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated. You need enough water in your body to keep your eyes moisturized.

, Eat a balanced diet rich with omega 3 fatty acids (salmon, flaxseed, nuts, etc.) to ensure healthy eyes and prevent inflammation.


Vitamins C, E, and zinc prevent eye problems that arise with age. You can find these vitamins in bell peppers, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, strawberries, oranges, cantaloupe, cabbage, tomatoes, raspberries, celery, and spinach.Vitamins B2 and B6 reduce age-related eye diseases and help prevent cataracts. Eat foods like eggs, fresh vegetables, whole cereals, dairy products, sunflower seeds, and meats like tuna, liver, and turkey.
Lutein and zeaxanthin protect the eyes from harmful lights. To boost these nutrients in your diet, eat plenty of green peas, green beans, orange bell peppers, corn, tangerines, oranges, mangos, eggs, and dark, green leafy vegetables such as kale, collard greens, broccoli, and spinach.
Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day.

, Though this is a common cause of eye redness, it's often ignored. Sleep replenishes your entire body, including your eyes. You should sleep 7 to 8 hours every night.Getting too little sleep can leave eyes dry and irritated, and also result in problems like eye twitching and bags under the eyes.


Another benefit of sleep is that it allows time for white blood cells to fight harmful pathogens., Allergies are a common cause of dry, red, irritated eyes. Seasonal allergies usually kick in at the beginning of spring, when pollen counts are high. The irritation comes from the body releasing histamines to fight off the allergy. The side effect of histamines is dry, itchy eyes. Buy over-the-counter antihistamines to treat your allergies, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.


You may also be allergic to pet dander. If you notice dry, itchy, or swollen eyes when you're around certain pets, avoid those animals. You can also see a doctor for injections to fight your dander allergy.

The most straightforward way to do this is just by flushing your face and eyes with cool water. You should do this for at least fifteen minutes.After doing this, keep the affected areas open to the air. Being exposed to the air helps the irritant evaporate after you've flushed your eyes with water.
If you have access to a sink or drinking fountain use this. Otherwise, use any clean water you can get hold of. You can also stand under a cold shower to rinse off., Flushing your face and eyes with water can help to wash off the oily pepper spray residue.

Splash milk onto your face.,
Use a towel soaked in milk.,
Rinse it off with water.",How to Get Pepper Spray Out of Eyes3," Milk is often used by people hit with pepper spray. The milk can ease the burn from the spray, but will not clean off the oils and residue. You can use milk to relieve the burn on your skin to make it easier to effectively flush out your eyes. Splash whole milk onto your face, keeping your eyes closed.


Milk is less effective than washing with water or saline at getting rid of the pepper spray remnants. Experts also caution that it is not sterile.Another way to apply milk is to pour some into a clean spray bottle. Keeping your eyes closed, squirt it over your face. This can lessen the irritation experienced by your skin, which in turn can make it easier for you to then go and flush out your eyes with water more effectively.

, After applying milk to your face it's important to rinse it thoroughly with cool clean water. The milk method shouldn't replace the use of water to flush out your eyes, but it can help to relieve the other painful symptoms which will exacerbate your discomfort. After rinsing, remember not to cover your face and eyes with any bandages or cloth, leave it exposed to the air.

Blink your eyes.,
Wash your hands.,
Pat away excess tears.,
Inspect your eye.,
Remove the dirt.,
Rinse your eyes.,
Seek medical attention.,
Expect discomfort.,
Protect your eye afterward.,
Seek help.,
Avoid making the problem worse.",How to Get Dirt Out of Your Eye," You may be able to dislodge the dirt in your eye with very little effort. Once you notice the dirt in your eye, blink your eyes several times. The blinking reflex in the eye allows the lashes and lids to move tears around and remove bacteria and debris out of the eye.


If simple blinking does not help, stretch your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid and then blink your eye repeatedly. This allows the lashes on the lower lid to sweep the dirt out of your eye.;
, If blinking doesn't get the dirt out, you need to intervene. Before touching your eye, however, you need to wash your hands. Washing hands before handling your eyes is important to reduce any possible contamination from bacteria, germs, or additional irritants. You don't want to remove any dirt from your eye only to infect it with something worse. This is important because your eyes are vulnerable to infections.


Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and warm water. Dry them on a clean towel., When you have dirt in your eye, you will likely have an increase in tear production. If you do, close your eyelids gently and dab your eye with a tissue. The increased tear production will help flush out the dirt.


Allow your eyes to water and the tears to wash them clean.

Do not rub your eyes. Use the tissue to gently blot up the overflow as it washes out of your eye., Pull your lower eyelid down and slowly look around, looking for anything lodged in your eyelid. Do the same with your upper eyelid, looking for anything lodged on your eyeball.


If you want to examine underneath your eyelid, place a cotton swab right above the upper eyelid and flip the lid over with the cotton swab.This will allow you look for any dirt lodged in the eyelid itself.If you are having a hard time finding the dirt, have a friend or family member do the inspection for you.

, If the dirt is on your eyelid or easily accessible area of your eye, you may be able to remove it with a cotton swab. If you can see the area of your eye or eyelid where the dirt is, take a clean cotton swab and dab it on the dirt. It should attach to the end of the swab after you dab it a few times.


Do not jab your eye with the swab or swipe the swab too harshly against the dirt. This could embed the dirt in your eyelid. If the dirt doesn't come off when you dab it, try another method.

, If the dirt hasn't come out with blinking or with a cotton swab, rinse your eyes to get the dirt out. To wash the dirt out of your eye, use an over-the-counter sterile eye wash or pour clean water over your eye using a cup. Keep up a continuous stream over your eye while holding your lids open for 15 minutes. Even after the dirt comes out, keep rinsing to help cleanse any additional debris from your eye.You can also apply gentle pressure with a stream of water from the faucet to wash debris from your eye, using your fingers to hold your lids open.Look for eyewash that has neutral pH of 7.0. Keep the water between 60°F (15.6°C) and 100°F (37.8°C) to keep your eye comfortable.If you have an eye bath, which is available at most pharmacies, use this to rinse your eyes.

, Seek emergency medical treatment right away if your attempts have failed to get the dirt or other debris out of your eye. Seek medical attention right away if you experience any of the following:You cannot remove the dirt from your eye
The dirt is embedded inside your eye
You experience blurred or otherwise abnormal vision
Pain, redness, or discomfort continues after the dirt has been removed from the eye
Blood in the eye, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or headache

, You should expect some minor discomfort after you get the dirt out. It's common to feel a scratchiness or discomfort in your eye, even after you have removed the offending dirt. This is part of the natural healing process and it can take up to 24 hours to recover., Take precautionary measures to protect your eye during the recovery process. During this time, your eye is extra sensitive. Protecting your eye includes:


Protecting eyes from ultraviolet light or bright light by wearing sunglasses
Avoiding the use of prescription contact lenses until your eye care professional has given the OK
Avoiding hand contact with the eye area and washing your hands before touching the eye area
Alerting and informing your eye care professional if new symptom arise or if pain becomes unbearable
If you continue to feel scratchiness or discomfort in your eye for more than a day after removing the dirt, consult a physician

, If your eye gets worse, you're going to need to see a specialist. Some after effects can be expected, but the effects should not last more than 24 hours. The continued discomfort and irritation could be a sign of a larger problem or an infection. Symptoms to look for are:


Blurred or double vision
Continual or increased pain
Blood covering part of the iris
Sensitivity to light
Signs of infectionNausea or vomiting
Headaches or lightheadedness
Dizziness or loss of consciousness, There are some actions that you should avoid when dealing with your eyes. These things can cause severe eye injury or pain. These actions include:Removing any piece of metal, large or small, that has lodged itself in the eye
Putting any pressure on the eye itself in an effort to dislodge the dirt
Using tweezers, toothpicks, or other hard object to get the dirt out

Listen to your doctor's advice if he or she recommends surgery.,
Get your liver treated (via medication or needle drainage) if needed.,
Have your colon assessed.,
Be aware of ""bacterial superinfection."",
Listen to your doctor's suggestions on prevention.,
Use preventative measures when travelling to endemic areas (where the disease is common).,
Follow-up with your doctor after treatment.",How to Treat Amebiasis," Amebiasis is a common health problem in Africa, Mexico, India, and parts of South America. Up to 90% of cases do not show active symptoms. This means you may not even be aware you have it. So it is always best to seek a professional opinion when in doubt.


If you suspect you may have amebiasis, your doctor can perform blood tests or stool tests to determine whether or not you have the disease. ;
, These include:


fever and/or chills
bloody or mucoid diarrhea
abdominal discomfort
alternating diarrhea with constipation.

, Amebiasis often resolves on its own; however, treatment can speed recovery and also prevent complications.


Complications can include severe and debilitating bowel troubles, as well as extra-intestinal disease, which means that the parasite invaded the lining of your colon and infected other areas of your body.
The most common location for extra-intestinal disease is in the liver, which always requires medical treatment, and sometimes surgery as well.
If you suspect you have amebiasis, or have been diagnosed with it, it is always best to seek the professional advice of your doctor on how best to proceed with treatment.

, Even if you do not have active symptoms of the infection, treatment is helpful both as a means to prevent potential complications and a way to ensure public safety. And of course, anyone with active symptoms is always treated. Medications for treatment include: paromomycin, iodoquinol, and diloxanide furoate among others. Ask your doctor about these options.
Understand that more intense medications are required for an infection that has spread to other parts of the body (such as the liver). In cases that have spread to the liver, metronidazole is the most common medication used. It is an antibiotic, but it works very well against this parasitic infection as well. , If you are having a lot of diarrhea as part of the symptomatology, it is likely that you are losing fluids and potentially becoming dehydrated. In cases such as these, always consult your doctor. You may need to be hospitalized to receive IV fluids, as fluid loss from diarrhea can be quite severe.

, There are times (such as with severe bowel symptoms or extra-intestinal disease) when surgical procedures are needed.


If your symptoms are not improving after a trial of medication, speak to your doctor about other medications you can try, and/or whether surgery may be needed in your case.

, Times when surgery would be needed include any of the following:


uncontrollable and debilitating bowel symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or constipation
excessive bleeding from your digestive tract
spread of the infection to other areas of your body. , Since the liver is the most common extra-intestinal organ to be infected, it sometimes needs special treatment. Small liver infections can often be treated with medication alone.
In more severe cases, however, your doctor will likely use a needle (with ultrasound guidance) to remove the infection from your liver.

, Sometimes, severe bowel symptoms (bowel inflammation and/or consistent diarrhea or constipation) are unable to be treated with medications alone. In more serious cases, a portion of damaged colon may need to be surgically removed.


If your colon has been ""broken open"" (the medical word for this is ""perforated""), this will also require surgical repair.
Follow the advice of your doctor as to when surgery is needed.

, As your body's immune system is busy fighting off the parasite that has led to amebiasis, other bacteria may have the chance to infect you simultaneously.


In cases such as these, your doctor may give you more powerful antibiotic treatment to eliminate any additional infections that have occurred at the same time.

, Prevention is a key part of treatment for a number of reasons.


First, you want to prevent the infection being passed on to any of your family members or friends. It is also a public health concern to ensure that appropriate infection precautions are taken.
Second, you do not become immune to amebiasis so it is important to protect yourself from acquiring the infection again. , These include:


Safe sexual practices - avoid sexual activities with people who may be infected as this increases the chances of catching it yourself.
Appropriate water treatment - always use bottled water, or boil or filter your water prior to drinking to avoid contamination.
Safe food choices - avoid raw fruits and vegetables, and try to eat cooked foods or fruits you can peel to avoid contamination. Non-pasteurized milk, cheese and other dairy products should also be avoided.
If you do eat raw vegetables, soak them in vinegar for 10-15 minutes prior to eating them. Street vendor foods, which are common in developing countries and are not evaluated for health practices, should also be avoided.
Proper hand washing is also important while abroad and at home.

, It is important to follow-up and get your stool tested to ensure that the amebiasis infection has been eradicated from your body.


Careful follow-up ensures that you are fully healthy, and also that others will not catch it from you.

Try the Bates Method.,
Palm your eyes.,
Trace a figure eight.,
Focus on near and far objects.,
Rest your eyes.,
Wear eye protection.,
Remove makeup and contacts every night.,
Avoid conjunctivitis.,
Eat right.,
Go to an optometrist.,
Get corrective lenses.,
Consider corrective surgery.",How to Get Better Vision," Some people believe that our eyes are like the rest of our body — the more we exercise and use them, the stronger they will become. The Bates Method uses this idea and a series of exercises to gradually improve your vision.While there is no scientific evidence that the Bates Method works, people in surveys do report improved vision. Eye exercises may be what is called a “placebo” effect — that is, practitioners report feeling better because they believe the exercises are helping. At the very least, the Bates Method does not harm.;
, The first step in the method is to “palm” your eyes by covering them with your hands. This should help to warm and relax the eyes.


Get into position by sitting in a chair with cushions in front of you. The cushions are for resting your elbows. Or, alternatively, lie on your back with some pillows behind your head. Some people prefer to palm in a darkened room.
Close your eyes and place your hands over your eyes with cupped palms. Make sure that you are not putting any pressure on your eyes. There should be no light, or very little, that reaches your vision.
Hold this position for 10 minutes to start. At the end of 10 minutes, assess yourself. Do you feel relaxed? If not, continue palming for a longer period.

, Another exercise that you can do is to trace a shape. Rolling your eyes in this way will activate eye muscles and, ideally, strengthen them.While sitting, imagine a figure eight placed about ten feet in front of you. Trace the figure up, down, and around with your eyes, keeping your head stationary. Repeat for several minutes.
Now, turn the figure eight on its side. With this image in your mind, begin to trace the shape again, slowly, without moving your head. Repeat for several minutes.
You can do this exercise practically anywhere, either at home, at work, or even on the subway.

, You’ve exercised the eye’s external muscles by tracing shapes. Now is the time to use the eye’s inner focusing mechanisms. Some people believe that this will improve your visual acuity.While sitting, perhaps at your desk, put your thumb about ten inches in front of your face and focus on it deeply for about thirty seconds.
Next, shift your gaze from the thumb to an object about 10 to 20 feet in front of you. Allow your eyes to refocus and concentrate on the object for another thirty seconds.
Take a deep breath and refocus on your thumb. Repeat this shift at thirty-second intervals for about two to three minutes.

, There are old myths that certain things will damage your eyesight, like reading in dim light. In fact, reading in dim light does not permanently injure your eyes, it only strains them. Excessive reading, especially on backlit computer screens, will do the same thing. Rest your eyes to keep them from becoming strained.To prevent eye strain, pace yourself. Rest briefly about once every 20 minutes by looking away from the screen or closing your eyes. Or try the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away or more, for 20 seconds.Make a conscious attempt to blink regularly. This keeps your eyes well lubricated.
If your eyes are tiring at a computer, try to adjust the light. Sometimes glare or harsh lighting can worsen eye strain.
When driving, aim vents away from your eyes. Dry, air-conditioned air sucks the moisture out of eyes like a sponge and can worsen eye strain.

, A set of glasses or goggles can guard your eyes from debris, chemicals, or glaring sunlight. Keep a pair around the house, in your car, or at work in case you need extra eye protection.


Swim goggles will protect your eyes from pool chlorine. While this chemical will probably not permanently damage your vision, it can often irritate and inflame your eyes.
Studies show that people who swim with goggles have lower numbers of bacterial colonies in their eyes.Safety goggles in the workshop goes without saying, and is one of the first rules of safety. These will protect you from any debris that might otherwise cause a corneal abrasion or worse.
Ultraviolet light from the sun can damage your corneas, lens, or other parts of the eye. Make sure to wear sunglasses when outside. When choosing sunglasses, go for UV protection that blocks 99 to 100% of rays. Blue-blocking lenses are better than amber, for example. Polarized lenses will also reduce glare for driving.Wear a large hat or cap along with your sunglasses. A wide-brimmed hat will block about 50% of UV radiation and reduce the UV rays that get around the glasses.

, It is important not to forget to remove your contact lenses before you go to sleep every night. Sleeping in contacts can allow harmful bacteria to breed in the eye, leading to infection.


Nearly one million Americans end up at the doctor each year with infections caused by contact lenses, many because they slept in their contacts or did not practice good contact care. Make sure to remove and properly clean your lenses every day.In serious cases, people have become blind from poor contact care, which led to the growth of amoebas.Remove eye makeup every night, as well. This will prevent small pieces of makeup from winding up in your eye and possibly scratching your cornea. If you leave on mascara, your stiff eyelash may get bent and poke your eye.

, Conjunctivitis, or “pink eye,” is the inflammation of the eye’s conjunctiva, or the thin layer of tissue that covers the eye whites. Usually it is caused by a viral infection, but it can also result from fungi, contact lens wear, or allergens.


Conjunctivitis causes irritation, burning and watery eyes. It can also include a discharge of pus from the eye and crusting on the eyelids and lashes.
While probably not permanently harmful, conjunctivitis is certainly unpleasant. You can avoid it by practicing good eye care, like washing your hands and not rubbing your eyes.
Use a fresh towel every time you wipe your face. Sharing face towels or napkins with others can transmit conjunctivitis.
Do not share makeup, makeup brushes, contact lenses, or eyeglasses.

, Eating the right things might not improve your vision, but it will give your body all the nutrients it needs to maintain it. There are many vitamins that help to promote good eye health. Make sure to include them in your meals.Eat fish twice a week, for example. Fish are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids — proven to reduce the risk of dry-eye syndrome. If you can't stand fish, try fish-oil supplements.
Have sweet potatoes for dinner tonight. Rich in Vitamin A, these spuds are especially good at improving your night vision.
Have spinach twice a week. It could be steamed, sauteed in olive oil with garlic, or perhaps in a quiche. It doesn't matter how you get it, just be sure to have it regularly. Studies show that lutein, a nutrient abundant in spinach, may prevent age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.
Cook with red rather than yellow onions. Red onions contain more quercetin, an antioxidant that is thought to protect against cataracts.

, Optometrists are doctors who specialize in basic eye care, including sight testing, diagnosing of problems, and prescribing of corrective lenses. The optometrist will give you a battery of eye tests and help to identify any issues that you’ve having. She is the foundation in your preventative eye-care.You should see an optometrist about once every two years if you are a healthy adult. Seniors and diabetics should go more often, once per year.Make an appointment with your eye doctor is you have any sudden changes in vision, double vision, halos, excess tearing, pain in the eye, sudden flashes of light, or unusual red eye. Any of these could be a symptom of a serious condition.

, The optometrist may prescribe corrective action to improve your vision. Lenses or surgery are, in fact, the only proven ways to actively correct vision — the rest is either unproven or prevention. In consultation with your doctor, decide what the best course of action is.


Most likely you’ll either get glasses or contact lenses. Both are used to correct conditions like near- and far-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia.
Nowadays many people choose contact lenses for cosmetic reasons, or because they don’t slide down the nose or fog up. However, glasses require less in the way of hygiene and everyday care. The choice is really up to you., Vision surgery is also known as “refractive eye surgery” and only works for certain types of vision — namely, near- and far-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia. If you are a candidate for corrective surgery, the procedure will be specially tailored to your issues.Vision surgery is generally done nowadays by laser, like the LASIK procedure. One downside is cost, as this surgery can be as much as a couple thousand dollars per eye.
There are also risks of complications like chronic dry eye. While complication arise in about 0–4% of cases, severe vision loss is very unusual. As always, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of this procedures, and what options suit you best.

Take acetaminophen.,
Rest as much as possible.There is no anti-viral medication available to treat the Zika virus, so your immune system will have to fight the infection on its own.,
Drink plenty of fluids.The Zika virus can cause dehydration, so make sure that you drink plenty of water.,
See a doctor if you suspect you have Zika.,
Get vaccinated if and when a vaccine is released.Medical researchers are currently working on developing a vaccine against the Zika infection.",How to Treat the Zika Virus1," Zika can cause muscle pain and headaches, so try taking an over-the counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen. The usual dose is between 500 to 1000mg every four to six hours.Max dosage for acetaminophen is 4000mg in 24 hours. You can find acetaminophen in your local drugstore or pharmacy. Make sure that you read and follow the instructions on the bottle.


Avoid taking NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin until after your Zika virus diagnosis has been confirmed by a physician. Symptoms of Zika can be similar to dengue fever and if you have dengue fever, taking Ibuprofen or Aspirin may increase your risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.;
, You can support your immune system by resting as much as possible.


Try to sleep for at least eight hours every night and take naps during the day as needed.
Take some time off of work and try to relax at home.
Avoid stressful or energy-consuming activities while you are recovering.

, Aim for about eight 8 ounce glasses per day. You can also include some decaffeinated tea and juice to hydrate yourself.


You may even want to include an electrolyte sports drink each day. The salt in the sports drink may help your body to hold onto some extra water.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol while you are sick with Zika. Caffeine and alcohol will make dehydration worse.

, If you think you may have been exposed to Zika or you may be sick, you should see your physician. This is especially true for women who are pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant.

, However, it has not yet been created and there is no announced release date. If a vaccine does become available, make sure that you get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Wash your hands before and after contact with an infected person.,
Wash for the appropriate amount of time, or use hand sanitizer.,
Take precautions against diseases that are transmitted through direct contact.,
Take precautions against diseases that are spread through droplets.,
Protect yourself from airborne diseases.,
Get vaccinated against communicable diseases when possible.",How to Avoid Communicable Diseases1," In standard or universal precautions, all bodily fluids from the infected person are considered contagious. Hand washing is one of the most standard ways that you can avoid becoming infected once you have had contact with an infected person. When you rub your hands together while washing them, you remove the microorganisms that could be present. To wash your hands thoroughly:


Get a paper towel to turn on the faucet. Wet your hands with soap and water. Apply enough soap and let it lather in your hands. Rub your hands palm to palm. Put your right palm over the other hand with the fingers interlaced and vice versa.
Rub your hands palm to palm with interlaced fingers. Rub the backs of your fingers to the opposing palms, interlocking your fingers. Rub the left thumb in a rotating motion together with the clasped right palm and vice versa. Rub your clasped fingers back and forth
Rinse your hands with water. Pat dry with a towel. Get a new paper towel and turn off the faucet.;
, According to the World Health Organization, the ideal duration of washing your hands is to sing the Happy Birthday song two times while you wash.


You can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as an alternate if soap and water are not available. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer can kill microorganism by dissolving their cellular membrane.

, Infections can be spread through stool, urine, vomitus, wound drainage, and other bodily fluids. These are considered forms of direct contact. Diseases can also be spread when you touch something that an infected person has touched (this is called indirect contact). You can use personal protective equipment to guard against both direct and indirect contact.


Gloves. These create a barrier between your hands and any infected surface.
Goggles.
Gown.
Also, hand washing is done before and after contact with infected persons if you work in a hospital or are taking care of someone that is ill.

, If you are taking care of someone who is sick, you should wear a face mask in case the person sneezes or coughs. When a person sneezes or coughs, microorganisms can be projected into the air.However, they do not remain in the air for long, but face masks can still help to protect you.

, Airborne diseases specifically spread through the air. The disease particles are very small, so a specific mask must be used. Get a N95 face mask that can protect you against these tiny airborne diseases.


Keep in mind that a person who is infected with an airborne disease will be kept in a special room at the hospital. This room will suck the air out through special ventilation devices. This may, anyone who enters the room will not be exposed to a great amount of the disease.

, There are some vaccines against communicable diseases like Yellow Fever. The vaccination process involves exposing you to a controlled amount of the virus, so that your immune system gains the ability to fight the virus off.Talk to your doctor about what vaccines may be available for the diseases in your specific area. You should also get certain vaccines if you are planning on travelling to areas that have communicable diseases.

Wear sunglasses.,
Use safety eyewear when necessary.,
Take breaks when working at a computer.,
Take precautions when traveling.,
Replace and wash contact lenses regularly.",How to Get Healthy Eyes1," Just as you protect you skin with sunscreen, your eyes also need added protection on sunny days. If you find yourself squinting or straining your eyes outside, wear sunglasses.


Look for sunglasses with 100% UVA or UVB protection.Choose a brand you feel comfortable wearing. You'll be less likely to make the effort to slip on your sunglasses if you feel unattractive or uncomfortable in them.
Too much exposure to the sun can increase your risk for cataracts or macular degeneration so sunglasses are a must on bright days. If you wear contact lenses, talk to your eye doctor about getting lenses with added UVB and UVA protection.;
, If you work a job where airborne materials are a hazard, use safety goggles at all times. You should also wear eye protection during contact sports, like ice hockey, as well as helmets and other protective material that keeps your head and eyes safe from injury., Many people spend the bulk of their workday using a computer. If this is the case for you, you need to be conscientious about how you treat your eyes. Eye strain, marked by blurry vision and difficulty focusing, is a common problem for office workers.


Every 20 minutes, rest your eyes by looking at something roughly 20 feet away for about 20 seconds. Every two hours, take a 15 minute break from the computer screen. Your eyes will benefit greatly from the rest.Keep your computer screen away from windows or lights, which can cause a glare. Dim your screen if the brightness strains your eyes. You should also tilt the screen so your eyes are level with the top of the monitor. Looking downward slightly when you work can take some strain away from your eyes.If you work long hours in front of a computer, consider wearing sunglasses or goggles at work. This can take some of the strain away if your eyes aren't looking directly at the screen.If your eyes feel dry, pause and blink for a few moments., When traveling, keep your eye health in mind. If you wear contacts, make sure to pack extras, as well as your contact case and solution. When on an airplane, the air tends to be dryer and more irritating to the eyes. Consider purchasing air drops from a local drug store to use when on an airplane., If you wear contact lenses, make sure you care for them properly. Always wash your hands thoroughly before removing or tampering with contact lenses. Take them out overnight and let them rest in clean solution. Always place new solution in your lens case rather than using the same solution from the night before.Make sure you keep track of when you need to replace your lenses. Wearing older lenses can increase your risk for an eye infection. How long you can wear your contact lenses varies depending on your brand. Some can be worn for a month while some are good for a few months. Make sure you ask your eye doctor how long you can safely wear a pair of lenses before they need replacing.

Get the facts on how the disease is spread.,
Avoid areas in which infections have been reported and suspected.,
Avoid direct contact with infected people.,
Avoid eating wild-caught bush meat.",How to Prevent Ebola1," Ebola can be spread in a number of ways, though primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and secretions of an infected patient. Contact with objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles have also been linked to the spread of the disease.Ebola requires direct contact to spread, so it cannot be spread through the air, and is unlikely to spread by coughing or sneezing. Mosquitoes and insects are also not known to be carriers.Because the symptoms of Ebola are nonspecific and take time to become severe, the spread of the disease to friends, family, and throughout hospitals is unfortunately common during an outbreak. In a healthcare setting, the reuse of unsterilized needles and the lack of proper hospital clothing has contributed to the spread of the disease near the source.;
, For now, the disease has only been confirmed in central and West Africa, with isolated cases in the U.S. and Europe among returning healthcare workers and within healthcare facilities where patients are being treated. For the most up-to-date travel warnings and information about potential outbreaks, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.


In general, you should avoid areas in which the disease has been reported and suspected. If you're already there, try to avoid healthcare facilities, unless you suspect you may be infected. Avoid direct contact with the infected, or anyone you suspect to be infected., Because the disease is spread primarily via direct contact with infected patients, the best way to avoid infection is to steer clear of people who are already sick. Blood and other bodily secretions from infected patients are linked closely with the spread of the disease – remember that you don't actually have to touch the infected person, you only have to come into contact with his or her blood or secretions on surfaces like clothing or bedding.The remains of infected bodies are still contagious, making it important to handle the deceased with extreme care. Avoid direct contact with bodies and with the bedding and clothing of the deceased.

, Researchers suspect that the disease came to humans via animals, probably through the consumption of the meat of primates.


If you're in an area where the disease has been reported, avoid purchasing, eating, or handling wild game to stay on the safe side."

Watch for potential complications.,
Seek prompt medical attention if you suspect you may have GBS.GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system.,
Get help for a child born with microcephaly.",How to Treat the Zika Virus2," The main two complications that may be associated with the Zika virus include GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and may lead to paralysis) and microcephaly (an abnormally small head circumference in infants born from infected mothers).The connection between these two complications and the Zika virus has not been confirmed, but there is a strong suspicion that they are related.


Any woman who is pregnant or trying to become pregnant and has traveled to countries with confirmed Zika should present to their physician at the first sign of any infection.
Because the potential complications are much more severe than the Zika virus itself, it is important to be aware of how to treat complications if and when they arise.

, It damages the outer covering of the nerves, leading to sensations of numbness and it may also cause paralysis. GBS starts in the feet and toes and then moves up towards the head.Treatment for GBS includes:



Ventilator support. You may need help breathing if the paralysis moves to your breathing muscles.

Plasma exchange. You may receive an infusion of new plasma (blood) to remove autoimmune antibodies that are causing the damage to your nerves.

Immunoglobulin therapy. This treatment fights the autoimmune antibodies in your system that are causing GBS.

Medications. You may need some medications for pain and other symptom management as needed.

, Microcephaly is a possible complication of the Zika virus that may affect the unborn baby of an infected pregnant woman. A baby born with microcephaly may have an abnormally small head, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. This condition can also cause an infant to die. Microcephaly has no cure, but there are strategies to support a child born with this condition.Support strategies include community and academic support programs, as well as monitoring and support from your child's doctor.
If you are pregnant and have been diagnosed with Zika, speak to your doctor as soon as possible.

Clean your house thoroughly.,
Ensure proper waste management.,
Remove any stagnant water from around your home.,
Avoid drinking contaminated water.,
Avoid eating street foods.,
Practice safe sex.,
Avoid sharing personal items.,
Increase your self-awareness.",How to Avoid Communicable Diseases2," Some surfaces and equipment are more commonly exposed to microorganisms than others. These items include:


Cloths and sponges. These materials are home to different microorganisms because they often come in contact with dirty surfaces such as the floor and dirty counters. As much as possible, use disposable cloths or paper towels. Reusable cloth or sponges should be disinfected in a bleaching solution after use and sundry.
Mops and buckets. These are considered one of the dirtiest tools at home as they always come in contact with the floor. Use two buckets when mopping. One for the detergent and one for rinsing. Also, after each use, disinfect the mop and bucket in a bleaching solution and leave to sun dry.
Lavatories. Always flush after each use and use antibacterial or antimicrobial disinfectants to clean the toilet at least every other day.
Sinks. Disinfect it with antibacterial or antimicrobial disinfectants at least every other day.
Curtains. They absorb most of the dust and other particles suspended in the air. Wash them at least once a week and use detergents that have antimicrobial properties.
Floors. Use a mop soaked in an antimicrobial solution to clean the floor. Clean up spills as they happen, as microorganisms generally thrive in wet environments.
Pets. Separate pet food from human food.

, Spoiled foods must be properly disposed of and trash cans should be kept sealed at all times to avoid attracting pests like rodents and cockroaches. Garbage also can be a place for microorganisms to thrive in.

, Stagnant water can be a place for mosquitoes and other intermediate carriers of communicable diseases, such as flies, to thrive in and lay eggs.

, If you are concerned that your water has been contaminated, there are ways that you can sterilize the water so that you can drink it. However, it is often best to call in professionals so that they can test the water first..Boiling. Water should be brought to a boiling point for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the fire. This ensures that microorganisms in the water are killed.
Chemical Disinfectants. Substances like chlorine and iodine are dissolved in water to remove parasites. However, this is not 100% effective, thus filtering or boiling water should also be used.
Portable Filtration Devices. Contains a pore size of less than 0.5 microns to filter viruses. It should be used in combination with either a boiling method or chemical disinfectant.
Bottled Water. Rather than risk your health, you could simply opt to buy bottled water instead of drinking possibly contaminated water.

, It is hard to know how street foods have been prepared, so try to avoid them as much as possible. If food is undercooked, or prepared in dirty environments, there is a good chance that it could cause you to get sick.

, There are communicable diseases that can be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse. If you are sexually active, use a condom because it can serve as a physical barrier between your genitals and bodily fluids.

, This includes eating utensils, toothbrush, razor, handkerchiefs and nail clippers. These items are potential sources of harmful microorganisms.

, Watch the news and keep track of any outbreaks of communicable diseases in your area. Maintain a good understanding of how those diseases are transmitted (are they airborne? are they passed through bodily fluids only?).

Understand that there must be a causative agent .,
Know that there must be a reservoir of infection.,
Be aware that there must be a portal of exit.,
Recognize the different modes of transmission.,
Understand that there must be a portal of entry.,
Be aware that the microorganism must have a susceptible host.,
Know that avoiding communicable diseases is best done by breaking the chain of infection.",How to Avoid Communicable Diseases3," A causative agent is any microorganism that is capable of producing an illness. These include bacteria, virus, parasites, fungi protozoa and other harmful microorganism.., This includes the environment and objects which an organism can thrive in and multiply.

, This is the path or way in which a certain organism leaves the reservoir.

, This is the means by which a certain infectious agent passes from the portal of exit from the reservoir to the susceptible host. It can be transmitted through four modes:


Contact Transmission – the most common mode of transmission which is divided into:

Direct contact – the infection is transferred from person to person.
Indirect contact – the infection is transferred when a person comes in contact with a contaminated object.


Droplet spread – the infection is transferred through respiratory secretions that can travel up to 3 feet (0.9 m).
Airborne transmission – the infection is transferred through fine particles that are suspended in the air for a prolonged period and inhaled.
Vehicular transmission – the infection is transferred through articles or substances that harbour the organism until it is ingested by the host; transmission by inanimate objects such as food, water, fomites or dust.
Vector-borne transmission – the infection is transferred by intermediate carriers such as mosquitoes, flea, flies and other bites from animals or insects.

, This is the venue wherein the microorganism gains complete entrance into the host.

, This includes a weakened human body or animals; in cases where their immune system cannot fight the microorganism, the microorganism will launch an infectious disease.

, That is, altering the mode of transmission. If the person knows how to prevent it, then the likelihood of getting a communicable disease is lower.

Know your family's medical history.,
Have regular eye exams.,
Talk to your doctor about quitting smoking.",How to Get Healthy Eyes2," Many issues with eye health are hereditary. Talk to your family members and ask if you have a family history of things like glaucoma or cataracts. This information can be helpful going into an eye exam. Your doctor will know what warning signs and symptoms to check for.Keep in mind medical conditions, like obesity and diabetes, can affect vision. You should know your family's medical history beyond problems with vision. This can help you figure out if you're at an increased risk for any disorders that could potentially affect your eyesight.
If you do have a medical history of conditions that affect vision, talk to your regular physician and eye doctor. Ask them what steps you can take to reduce your risk of inheriting these disorders.

, You should have an eye exam each year. Even if you do not wear glasses or contacts, it's important you have your eyes checked regularly. Many common eye diseases have little warning signs. Only your eye doctor will be able to detect such conditions during an exam.Get your pupils dilated during an exam. This allows your eye doctor to do a more extensive examination of your eyes to make sure they are healthy. Your eye doctor will place a few drops of liquid in your eyes, causing your pupils to increase in size. He or she will then perform an examination.If you're having your pupils dilated, it might be best not to drive afterwards. An eye exam can cause your vision to be blurry or shaky for a few hours.

, If you're a smoker, you should take efforts to quit. Smoking can increase risk for several health conditions that affect your vision, like cataracts, macular degeneration, and inflammation of the eye's inner layer.See your regular physician to talk about a plan to quit smoking. He or she may be able to provide you with advice or guidelines on how to cut back and eventually cut out tobacco completely. Your doctor may also be able to give you to a referral to an addiction counselor or therapist who can also help you to quit.
Talk to your friends and family members about how you're trying to quit smoking. Quitting smoking is incredibly difficult and to do so successfully you'll need help from others. Ask friends and family members to talk to you when you're having cravings. If you have loved ones who smoke, ask them politely to not do so in front of you.
You can join a support group, in person or online, to reach out to others trying to quit tobacco.

Eat the right fruits and vegetables.,
Go for foods high in zinc.,
Get a lot of Omega-3-rich foods in your diet.",How to Get Healthy Eyes3," When it comes to eye health, diet makes a big impact. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is important for overall health. Certain fruits and veggies have a particularly positive impact on eye health.


In terms of veggies, carrots do have health benefits for the eyes. However, there are many other vegetables you can incorporate into your diet that will also help. Go for kale, collard greens, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, peas, and Swiss chard.For fruits, try peaches, avocados, blueberries, honeydew melons, apricots, papayas, and grapefruit., Zinc is an important mineral when it comes to healthy eyes. Zinc is found in many meats, such as King crab, lamb, and lean beef. It's also found in grains and whole wheat, such as fortified breakfast cereals and whole-wheat and buckwheat flours. Legumes like beans are also an excellent source of zinc., Foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids can have a positive benefit on your eyes. Seafood is often rich in these acids. Salmon, herring, tuna, rainbow trout, and sardines are good options. In terms of non-meat options, flaxseed, English walnuts, canola oil, and roasted soybeans are a good choice."

Familiarize yourself with Ebola symptoms.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients.,
Disinfect all medical hardware.,
Isolate the infected, the deceased, and their belongings.,
Monitor your health carefully for twenty-one days after leaving an outbreak zone.",How to Prevent Ebola2," Unfortunately, Ebola lacks any obvious, tell-tale symptoms that enable an immediate diagnosis. Since the symptoms are somewhat general, you must use your judgment to determine whether or not your proximity to an outbreak and the symptoms you note might signify the presence of the disease.


If you are in proximity to an outbreak, and/or to someone who has been near one, err on the side of caution if you have symptoms.
Symptoms normally appear between 2-21 days after exposure, with an average of 8-10 days.Common symptoms of the disease include:Fever
Severe headache
Fatigue
Muscle pain
Weakness
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Stomach pain
Unexplained bleeding or bruising



, Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and warm water is absolutely essential, especially if you're in the midst of an outbreak.Everyone assumes they wash their hands sufficiently, but there is a proper method to washing hands properly. This is the time to use it.
If in a medical setting, you should wash your hands, up to the elbow, before removing your hospital gown and other protective wear, and again after removal is complete.
Using alcohol-based hand sanitizers is better than doing nothing, but a good scrubbing with soap and warm water is always preferable.

, While it's safest to avoid areas of infection entirely, if you're working as a healthcare provider or volunteer around infected patients, the use of extreme caution is necessary.


When the virus first broke out, the CDC recommended that hospital workers use disposable masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, to be worn at all times around infected patients. After a few cases of Ebola among healthcare workers in the U.S., however, the CDC recommends a Level 4 suit with a protective hood and taped seams for workers around Ebola patients.Proper removal procedures are just as vital as how you put the protective clothing on. Study and follow the most up-to-date recommendations closely and with great care.It's also important to never reuse needles under any circumstances. Discard bedding and clothing that came in direct contact with infected patients. Extreme caution is necessary.

, Anything that comes into contact with infected patients, or with the bodily fluids of infected patients, needs to be properly discarded or sterilized immediately following use. Disinfectant needs to be used liberally in patients' rooms, and around sleeping areas specifically, to avoid the spread of the infection.There are several acceptable methods for sterilizing medical instruments; make sure that whatever method chosen is followed carefully and completely.
To sterilize medical instruments, first rinse them thoroughly immediately following use while wearing protective mask, gloves, and gown. Then follow the sterilization protocol.
Operate the sterilizer according to proper procedures and then catalog the instruments and label them sterilized.

, If you're working with the infected, the highest level of security needs to be practiced. Isolation practices must extend as well to those who may have died of Ebola, along with the belongings of the living and deceased.Plastic zipper barriers are being employed in some hospitals to minimize the contact that health care professionals have with infected patients, and in most hospitals patients are being quarantined, or separated from the general population to minimize the risk of disease spreading. Direct contact with patients needs to be reduced as much as possible.
The bodies of the deceased can still spread the infection, and as such must be handled with as much care as the living. Belongings must also be properly disposed of or disinfected., If you pass three weeks without displaying any symptoms of Ebola, you are generally considered to be ""in the clear.""If you display anything resembling Ebola symptoms during this 21-day period, you owe it to yourself, your loved ones, and the public at large to seek medical attention immediately.

"
"
Seek medical attention immediately if you have possible symptoms and risk of exposure.,
Undergo diagnostic testing if warranted.,
Contact the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) immediately.,
Address symptoms as they arise.,
Rest and wait.,
Stay abreast of treatment options.",How to Prevent Ebola3," Remember, time is of the essence, not only to address your symptoms before they become too severe (should you have Ebola), but also to prevent additional spread of the infection.If you have a fever or body aches but have not been near an Ebola outbreak region (or person who visited one), you probably don't have to worry. Likewise, if you've had such exposure risks but have no symptoms, you are unlikely to be infected. It's when both factors (symptoms and risk factors) are present that immediate action needs to be taken.

, Diagnosis via symptom is somewhat difficult, because the symptoms are general. If you're experiencing any of the symptoms described in the previous section of the article, however, and you're in an area with reported infections, it's essential that you go to the hospital immediately and have a diagnostic test performed.Depending on the facility and the amount of time since your symptoms appeared, any of the following diagnostic tests may be performed:

Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing
IgM ELISA (Immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Virus isolation



, If you're in an area of infection and suspect that you may be infected, contact the CDC immediately to report your illness. Keeping the disease contained is essential, meaning that new infections need to be reported as quickly as possible in order to deploy resources and put efficient quarantines into place.


The CDC main phone number is 800-232-4636 (CDC-INFO).
Outside the U.S., contact the comparable health organization in that nation. Or, contact the World Health Organization (WHO) at + 41 22 791 31 11., Although some promising testing has been done,there is currently no vaccine or other ""cure"" for Ebola, so most of the treatment available involves addressing the specific symptoms and making the patient comfortable. Common symptom treatments include the following:Maintain your electrolytes and stay hydrated. One of the most uncomfortable symptoms of the disease is severe diarrhea and nausea, making it important that you stay hydrated and keep your electrolytes up. Sports drinks can be used for mild dehydration, but IV-drip should be used in serious cases.

Monitor your blood pressure and control it if necessary. Rising blood pressure can destabilize a patient, while dropping blood pressure may be a serious sign of infection, making it important to keep your blood pressure under control. Health care workers should therefore keep a close watch on your blood pressure.
Breathe in an oxygen-rich environment. Difficulty breathing and chest pains are common in the infected, so oxygen is typically administered to make breathing as easy as possible. If you're struggling to get your breath, talk to a health practitioner immediately and have your oxygen levels checked.
Quickly address any symptoms of infection. It's important to communicate openly with the hospital staff and let them know of any discomfort or complications so that they may address your symptoms programmatically. Infections need to be treated locally with antibiotics and addressed swiftly, so be honest about when and where you're feeling pain.

, In the end, despite the best efforts of your medical providers, there's not much to be done but to try to ride out the disease. Keep your strength up, stay hydrated, and try to get as much rest as possible.


The disease is fatal in roughly 50% of the cases,but patients in good health with strong immune systems can often pull through if swift care is provided and safe recovery practices are followed.

, Currently, there have been but a few vaccine trials that have shown promise, but scientists are working around the clock to develop effective measures to combat Ebola. Check with the CDC or WHO periodically for more information regarding potential vaccines/cures, and for up-to-date, general information about Ebola.

Educate yourself.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Cancel, reschedule, or plan a different trip if needed.,
Be aware of travel advisories.,
Always keep food and water safety in mind.,
Recognize symptoms while traveling and visit your doctor when you return.",How to Avoid Contracting Infectious Diseases While Traveling," While you're planning your trip, research the infectious diseases endemic to the area you want to visit. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a useful webpage that allows you to easily identify illnesses by country. Knowing the diseases you may encounter will allow you to prepare properly!;
, Visit your doctor 4-6 weeks before you leave for your trip. Ensure you are up-to-date on general vaccinations like Measles, Mumps, Pertussis, and Tetanus, and receive any vaccinations you need to for your trip. Some vaccines are recommended, but in other cases, you will not be allowed to enter a country without proof of vaccination.



Vaccination: If you're traveling to an area where Diphtheria, Hepatitis A, B, C, or E, Influenza, Viral Meningitis, Japanese Encephalitis, Polio, Rabies, Rubella, Typhoid, or Yellow Fever rates are high, consider vaccination to protect yourself.

Medication: If you are traveling to an area where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about anti-malaria medication.

Insect Repellant: Many infections are caused by bug bites including malaria, dengue, trypanosomaisis, chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. There are no known cures to these ailments, so protect yourself from exposure by using insect repellent. Look for strong active ingredients like DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon, eucalyptus, and IR3535, and wear permithrin-treated clothing.

, In some instances, you may choose to cancel, reschedule, or postpone your trip. For example, the CDC strongly recommends that pregnant women avoid locations endemic with malaria. If you are pregnant and must travel to a country where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about your anti-malaria medication options.

, The CDC offers valuable infectious disease travel information by country, and updates the travel warning regularly.

, You can contract various types of infection by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food. Areas with poor water sanitation or inadequate sewage systems can lead to infection.


In these locations, avoid contaminated water by only drinking unopened canned or bottled drinks and avoiding ice. Beverages involving boiled water like coffee and tea are okay.
Avoid possible contaminated foods like meat that has been allowed to cool (street vendors), raw vegetables including salads, raw fruit unless it is washed with clean water and peeled, and unpasteurized dairy.

, Travelers commonly experience diarrhea which can often be cured with rest and hydration.


If diarrhea persists, contact your doctor.
If you experience fever at all, inform your doctor upon your return.
If you become very ill, contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.They can help you find a doctor near your current travel location.
For more information regarding illness abroad, look to the CDC's research on Obtaining Health Care Abroad."

Examine your produce carefully.Before eating fruits and veggies, check for visible dirt, slugs, bugs, and snails.,
Rinse your fruit and vegetables.Place your produce under a cold-water spray for a few seconds, then soak it in distilled water for one or two minutes.,
Clean your preparation area.Cutting boards and surfaces where you’ll be chopping or otherwise prepping your produce need to be cleaned with hot soapy water.,
Freeze potential carriers before cooking.,
Boil snails and prawns before eating.Angiostrongyliasis is caused by a parasite commonly found on snails and prawns.,
Use caution when eating abroad.Angiostrongylus infections are prevalent in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas.",How to Prevent Angiostrongyliasis1," If you see any, remove them, then wash your hands thoroughly. Clean the thick skin of melons, cucumbers, citrus, and potatoes with a vegetable brush under cool water even if you don’t see any visible debris, as the grooved surface can trap yucky bits that might cause angiostrongyliasis.;
, Pour the water out and, if you wish, let your produce dry.


Do not use bleach, soap, or detergent on your produce when washing it, as these products can harm you if residue is ingested.
Washing with cool tapwater is just as good as washing with commercial fruit and vegetable rinses. Don’t bother buying these commercial products to wash your produce.
Even organically-grown veggies and fruits need to be washed because they might have come in contact with creatures that carry angiostrongyliasis parasites.

, Utensils, likewise, need to be scrubbed clean with hot, soapy water before use.

, Snails, crabs, frogs, and prawns, for instance, should be frozen in order to kill any parasites within them. Store them at a temperature at or below -35 degrees Fahrenheit (-37.3 degrees Celsius) for at least 15 hours to kill any potential parasites.Most home freezers cannot reach temperatures this low, however, so be sure you know the actual temperature of your freezer before assuming that it can reach temperatures low enough to kill the parasite.

, If you consume snails, prawns, crabs, shrimp, and other mollusks, take precautions before consuming. Boil these creatures for 3-5 minutes to kill the parasitic larvae.


Do not eat raw snails, prawns, or other mollusks.

, Observation of these preventive measures is especially important when traveling to these areas or eating exotic foods like snails, monitor lizards, frogs, or slugs.


Avoid restaurants or public eateries that do not use proper seafood handling techniques or equipment.

"
Practice good sanitation in your garden.Locations where rodents, snails, and slugs thrive are also locations where you are most at risk for contracting angiostrongyliasis.,
Keep snails and slugs out of your garden.,
Control rats and other rodents.Rats and mice can be vectors for angiostrongyliasis, especially those in or near your garden.",How to Prevent Angiostrongyliasis2," When working in your garden, wear gloves. Gardening gloves are readily available at most home improvement stores. When you’ve finished gardening, wash your hands thoroughly. This will prevent transfer of the parasitic larvae to your mouth and other surfaces within your home.

, Keep your crops in raised box beds and off the ground. Incorporate compost and organic matter into your garden to prevent the cool, moist conditions that slugs and snails thrive in. Place copper strips along the edge of your garden boxes, or install a low copper fence around the edge of your ground-level garden.


Other barriers you could surround your garden with to prevent snails and slugs include coffee grounds, diatomaceous earth, and sand.If you’re really desperate to keep slugs and snails out, bait and traps are available at most gardening or home improvement stores.

, Prevent the spread of the parasite by setting up mouse traps to kill rodents in or near your home. Place them against walls both inside and outside your home, and check them frequently. When you catch a rat, use disposable gloves to put it in the garbage.


Do not use rat poison if you have small children or other pets in your home.

"
"
Recognize symptoms.,
Consult your doctor.,
Get appropriate treatment.",How to Prevent Angiostrongyliasis3," Symptoms of Angiostrongyliasis are generally mild. They include a slight fever or gastrointestinal discomfort. You might also experience a strange tingling or pain across the surface of your skin.


If the parasite migrated into your eye, you might have blurred vision or eye pain in addition to the other symptoms.
In certain extreme cases, you might experience seizures.Symptoms might appear within 24 hours or as much as one month after initial infection.If you are experiencing a stiff neck, headaches, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, you may have meningitis due to angiostrongyliasis. This is extremely serious. Seek immediate, emergency medical care.

, Even if you manifest the relevant symptoms, you might not necessarily have angiostrongyliasis, and the disease is hard to diagnose. Only a trained medical doctor can confirm if you are or are not infected with the parasite. If you have meningitis, you might need a spinal tap, a procedure in which spinal fluid is drawn. The doctor will then examine your white blood cells for evidence of parasites.

, While the parasitic larvae will die on their own given enough time (usually two to eight weeks), there are courses of treatment that will ease your symptoms until the parasites die off. After consulting with your doctor, he or she might prescribe painkillers or corticosteroids (to prevent inflammation). The specific course of treatment you’ll need will be determined by your doctor.


Turn down suggestions to take anti-helminthic (anti-parastic) drugs. These have not been proven effective in treating angiostrongyliasis and might actually exacerbate your condition.In some extreme cases, a length of inflamed intestine might need to be removed."

Wash your hands.,
Avoid touching your face, eyes, and nose.,
Keep all immunizations up to date.,
Stay home.,
Prepare and store food safely.,
Practice safe sex and do not share personal items.,
Travel wisely.",How to Protect Yourself from Infectious Diseases1," Proper hand hygiene is vital when it comes to preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Pathogens (such as viruses, bacteria and fungi) are easily transferred from contaminated surfaces to your skin and from there to your eyes and mouth where they can gain access to inside your body. Thus, washing your hands is one of the first steps to take to reduce the transfer of infectious agents.Wash your hands every time after going to the bathroom, changing a diaper, sneezing or blowing your nose and when coming into contact with bodily fluids.Wash your hands before and after working with food.
When washing your hands, use soap and warm water to wet your hands up to your wrists and scrub the skin for at least 20 seconds or more.If water and soap is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and rub it from your fingertips to your wrists in order to eliminate pathogens.;
, People tend to touch their face several times throughout the day. This is when the infectious agents in your hands gain access to your body. Where an intact skin does not allow transfer of pathogens into the body, the eyes and mucous membranes in the nose and mouth do allow this.Besides maintaining a proper hand hygiene, try to avoid touching your face, even with clean hands.
Avoid direct contact between the palm of your hand and face and use a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
If a tissue is not available, cover your mouth or nose with your elbow. After using a tissue, discard it immediately into a proper waste receptacle and wash your hands

, Vaccines are a preventive measure that help prevent or lessen illness caused by infectious pathogens. They work by stimulating an immune response against a specific pathogenic agent and, if you are ever exposed to the pathogen, your immune system can fight it more effectively.Get all adult and childhood immunizations on time and keep an accurate vaccination record at home for every family member to ensure everyone remains up to date.
Because vaccines are designed to activate your immune system to recognize specific pathogens, some vaccines may cause minor symptoms, such as fever, fatigue and muscle aches, that last a day or two.Some vaccinations require booster shots (such as tetanus and polio) at certain intervals to maintain immunity., When you are sick with infectious disease, it is important to limit exposing other people to the pathogen and spreading the illness. Although some infectious diseases do not spread easily from person-to-person contact, others do and thus, you should stay home when you are symptomatic.If you are at public spaces, cover your mouth and nose with your elbow while coughing (and not with your hand) to avoid spreading pathogens airborne and transferring germs with your hands.
Wash your hands and clean shared surfaces often if you are sick in order to minimize transmission of germs.

, Some pathogens can be transferred into your body via food (so called foodborne illnesses or pathogens). Once food is consumed and the pathogen gains access to your body, it can multiply and cause illness. Thus, it is vital you prepare and store all food appropriately.Prepare your food responsibly by limiting cross contamination. Raw food should never be prepared on the same surface as ready-made food to prevent transferring pathogens.
Clean your work surfaces regularly and keep them clean and dry. Pathogens can thrive on wet environments.
Wash your hands before and after handling food. You should also wash your hands when you are changing ingredients (eg, from raw food to fresh food).
Food should be stored at safe temperatures (refrigerated if needed) and thrown out if you doubt their quality. Changes in color and texture and strange odors are signs that your food has spoiled.
Hot food should be eaten when it is prepared and, if it needs to be stored, kept either hot (as in buffets) or refrigerated as soon as possible to keep pathogens from multiplying.

, Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are spread when bodily secretions come into contact with your genitals, mouth, and eyes. Practice safe sex to limit your risk of catching an STD.Always protect yourself by using a condom or dental dam during sexual activity, especially if you are not in a monogamous relationship.
Do not engage in any sexual activity when you or your partner have a cold sore or genital wart breakout. This can lead to spreading incurable herpes.
Get tested for STDs before and after engaging in sexual activities with a new partner so that you are aware of your status.

, Be aware of the risks of infection that increase when you travel. Some infections may be more common in places you are traveling versus where you live.Talk to your doctor about important vaccinations to get when you are traveling. This allows you to build up your immunity and be more prepared to the native pathogens present at the areas where you are travelling to.
Wash your hands frequently when you are traveling to avoid transferring germs to your body via your hands.
Protect yourself against infections that are carrier by vectors such as mosquitos by taking precautions, such as sleeping in mosquito netting, using bug spray, and wearing long-sleeved clothing.

Understand different kinds of infectious diseases.,
Treat bacterial infections with antibiotics.,
Treat viral infections.,
Know how to treat fungal infections.,
Know how to treat parasitic infections.",How to Protect Yourself from Infectious Diseases2," You should be aware of the different agents that can spread infection. This can help you manage your risk factors.Bacteria are the most common infectious agents. They can be transmitted via bodily fluids and food. They are single cell living microorganisms that use your body as a home base to replicate.
Viruses are pathogens that cannot live outside the host. When a virus enters your body, they hijack your body’s cells to multiply and spread to neighboring cells.
Fungi are simple, plant-like living organisms that may take up residence in your body.
Parasites are living organisms that hijack the host’s body and use their resources to thrive., Antibiotics are medications that fight off bacterial infections. They work by disabling or killing bacterial cells and thus, fastening the elimination of bacteria by your immune system.Use topical antibiotic ointments for small wounds that are infected. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, warmth and pain. Do not use antibiotic ointment for heavily bleeding wounds that are deep. Seek medical attention if you have a wound that does not stop bleeding.
For systemic bacterial infections, visit your healthcare provider and ask if you should be taking oral antibiotics.
It is important to understand that antibiotics cannot cure or treat viral infections, such as the cold or flu. Your doctor can diagnose bacterial versus viral infection and treat it appropriately.
Take antibiotics only as directed. Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them (such as when you have a viral infection) increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

, Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics but there are some antiviral medications that can be used for certain viruses. Some viral infections are treated with at home remedies (such as rest and remaining hydrated).Some drugs, known as antiviral or antiretroviral drugs, can fight off certain viruses by taking away their ability to reproduce their DNA inside your cells.
Some viral infections, such as the common cold, only need to have their symptoms treated to make you more comfortable. Your immune system can fight off the virus as long as you are not immunocompromised and get enough rest and nutrients.
Many viral illnesses can be prevented with vaccinations. Thus, you should keep your immunizations up to date.

, Some fungal infections can be treated with medications that help eliminate the fungi and clear the infection. However, there are numerous pathogenic fungi that cause infections and only your doctor can diagnose and prescribe proper treatments.Some fungal infections may be treated with a topical ointment if the infected site is on your skin (such as foot fungus).
Very serious and threatening fungal infections are treated with oral medications or injections.
Some examples of pathogenic fungi include histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, and these infections can be deadly.

, As the name implies, parasites are organisms that ""hijack"" your body’s resources in order to live, grow and multiply inside you. Parasites refers to a wide array of pathogenic agents from worms to microscopic cells.Many parasites can be transferred into your body via contaminated food or water (such as hookworm), while others enter via broken/compromised skin (such as malaria via mosquito bite).
You should never drink unfiltered or non-purified water from natural sources as the water may contain parasites.
Some parasitic infections can be treated with oral or injected medications.
Your doctor can diagnose a parasitic infection based on your symptoms and specific tests and then treat it appropriately.

Have a pre-operative exam with your surgeon, usually a day or two before the surgery.,
Arrive a couple hours before your scheduled time of surgery, on the day of the surgery, so that you can go through the admitting procedures and any last minute tests that may need to take place.,
Depending on how long you are in the recovery room, you may need pain medication as the anesthesia wears off.,
When the nurses feel you are stable, they will request a room on an orthopedic or surgical floor and you will be transferred there after recovery.

,
Once you are in your room, you will probably be left alone for a while, though your vital signs will be taken frequently, and you will be asked about your need for pain medication.,
On the second day, your vital signs will be taken, your blood will be drawn, the catheter will be removed, you will be assisted out of bed, and physical therapy will be started.,
On the third day you may have physical therapy several times.,
Depending on your condition, you may be discharged on the fourth day.,

, This will explain what you will be going through while you are in the hospital and what to expect when you go home for recuperation.[[Image:Deal With and Recover From Complete Knee Replacement Surgery Step 2.jpg}}, Post-surgery rehabilitation will be significantly easier if your muscles are stronger. Ask your doctor for exercises you can do at home to prepare, or consider working with a personal trainer or physical therapist.

,, That means donating blood for your own use, should it be needed during surgery, about two weeks before the surgery. Some surgeons use a bipolar sealing device that may reduce or eliminate the need for this step.

, He or she will check your general health, order blood work, a chest x-ray, and other tests to determine if you are healthy enough for surgery.

, Last minute details will be discussed and you will be asked to sign some papers, including a consent form, where you will give permission for the surgeon to perform the knee replacement.

, The anesthesiologist will most likely stop by to review your history and to discuss anesthesia options with you. A catheter will be placed in your bladder so that you won't have to get out of bed to urinate during the first day. You will be in the recovery room for several hours before you are moved to your room. It will be suggested that you leave your valuables at home--your visitors can bring them later, if necessary, along with your toiletries and other personal things. Remember though, you will not be able to keep an eye on them every minute. You may not feel like doing much except resting during that first day.

, Don't be hesitant to ask for it.

,, This is often assessed by asking you to rate your pain according to a particular scale.


You may be able to receive visitors, depending on the hospital's policy.
You sometimes will remain in bed for the whole day; however some surgeons have you at least stand up the first evening of your surgery day.
If you are up to it, you can have a meal, probably a liquid diet to begin with. Solid food is usually offered once bowel sounds are heard.
You may be given anti-coagulants, such as heparin, to avoid blood clots in the surgical leg. Likewise, you will probably be given compression hose and/or ""leg squeezers"" (leggings with alternating on/off air pump) which also help to prevent blood clots.
Your surgical leg may or may not be placed on a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine, depending on your doctor’s orders and whether it is covered by your health insurance policy. The purpose of the CPM machine is to start your knee moving before you're out of bed, to decrease stiffness, and to prevent the development of scar tissue.
Some hospital settings allow for the self-administration of pain medication through an IV pump. This is called patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). When you have pain, you can give yourself medication by pushing a button on the PCA pump. The machine will not allow you to give yourself more than a pre-programmed amount so that you cannot overdose.
If you are having a hard time sleeping, ask for a sleeping pill.

, You will most likely start by simply sitting in a chair for a while. In most settings, you will be shown how to take a shower, either with or without accompaniment.


The physical therapist will teach you how to get out of bed using the log-roll maneuver, which will allow you to get out of bed without putting much stress on your knee. He or she will then teach you how to use a walker. On the first session, you may only walk 10 feet (3.0 m) before returning to your bed or chair. Sitting in a comfortable chair is an encouraged alternative to lying in bed that helps with your lung function and circulation.

, You might walk two to three times as far as the previous session. Pain medication may make walking (with assistance) easier and less painful. Keep in mind that more mobility brings increased circulation and faster healing. Use the CPM machine according to your doctor's instructions.

, Prescriptions need to be written, morning medications need to be administered, and other check-out procedures will take place. From the time your doctor writes the order for your discharge until the time you leave may be a few hours. Have clothing handy; make sure your pants will fit over a swollen knee. Your doctor will give you prescriptions for medication that can be filled at a local pharmacy--a family member can do that once you are resting comfortably at home. These prescriptions are for pain pills and other medications your doctor feels are necessary for your recovery.

, Have the seat slid back as for as possible and the back rest folded down, so that you can move your buttocks as far away from the door jamb as possible. Once inside, you can reposition the seat back to the normal position. Alternatively, you can slide in buttocks-first into a rear seat and keep your leg elevated for the ride home.


If you have no caregivers at your house who can help, you may be able to go to an extended care facility after the hospital discharge. This will give you more time to recuperate, so when you do go home you can tend to yourself more easily.

, When you feel rested, that is a good time to do the exercises you were shown by the hospital physical therapist. If your insurance company provides you with a home CPM machine, use it according to your doctor's discharge instructions. This will leave you little time for anything else, except perhaps a good book or TV.

, If the insurance company does not pay for physical therapy, consider paying for it yourself to minimize the chance of complications. You will need to set up session times with the therapist. The sessions will help you recover faster and more completely.

, Practice walking in a level and safe location and have someone with you during your first walks with the cane. If you have stairs in your home, the physical therapist at the hospital will have instructed you on the use of crutches, and will have tested your ability to negotiate stairs independently with your crutches. If you cannot manage the stairs with crutches, it's best to stay on a single floor, setting up a bed and bedside commode in a living room, for example.


Walking with a cane gives you much more freedom. Remember to keep the cane in the opposite hand from the surgical knee. When going up or down stairs, remember the surgical leg goes down first and the other leg goes up first.

, Being able to drive will depend on a number of factors, such as the frequency of pain medication, whether your car is an automatic or stick shift, and which knee was replaced.

Be aware of numbness in your feet.,
Be alert to tingling and burning sensations.,
Take note of increased sensitivity to touch, called hyperesthesia.,
Pay attention to cramps or sharp pains.,
Be mindful of muscle weakness.,
Check for toe deformities.,
Be very cautious with any signs of injury or infection.,
Look for similar symptoms in your hands.,
Check yourself for signs of autonomic neuropathy.,
Be alert to changes in your vision.",How to Check Feet for Complications of Diabetes," One of the initial and most common symptoms of peripheral neuropathy that diabetics notice is that their feet lose sensation and become numb.It can start in the toes, then progress to the rest of the foot and then up the leg in a stocking-like distribution. Usually both feet are affected, although one side may begin first or be more noticeable than the other.


Related to the numbness is a reduced ability to feel pain from excessive temperatures (both hot and cold). Because of this, diabetics are at greater risk of getting scalded from a hot bath or getting frostbite during the winter.
Chronic numbness can prevent a diabetic from knowing when their foot is cut, blistered or otherwise injured. This phenomenon is very common in diabetics, and can result in the foot becoming infected. Sometimes, the neuropathy is so bad that the foot is infected for a long time before the person realizes it, and the infection can get deep into the tissue and even affect the bone. This can require a long course of IV antibiotics and can be potentially life-threating.
Peripheral neuropathy symptoms, such as numbness, are usually worse at night while in bed.;
, Another common symptom is uncomfortable sensations, such as tingling, pins and needles and/or burning pain.Such sensations can feel similar to those when circulation returns to your foot after it has been ""asleep."" The uncomfortable sensations, called paresthesia, range from mild to severe and don't usually affect both feet equally.


Tingling and burning sensations usually begin on the bottom (soles) of the feet, although they can also progress up the legs.
These strange sensations can sometimes mimic a fungal infection (Athlete's foot) or an insect bite, although the diabetic foot is typically not as itchy.
Peripheral neuropathy in the feet develops because there's too much sugar (glucose) in the blood, which is toxic and destructive to small nerve fibers.

, Another alteration of foot sensations that develops in a minority of diabetics is an increase in sensitivity to touch.So instead of reduced sensation and numbness in the feet, which is the most common outcome, some diabetics become overly sensitive or even hypersensitive to touch. For example, even the weight of a bed sheet on their feet can be agonizing to diabetics with this condition.


This type of diabetic-related foot complication can mimic or be misdiagnosed as a gout attack or severe inflammatory arthritis.
The type of pain associated with this increased sensitivity is often described as electric in nature or burning pain.

, As the peripheral neuropathy progresses, it starts to affect the muscles of the feet. One of the first signs of muscle involvement in a diabetic is foot cramps and/or sharp shooting pains, especially in the soles.The cramps and pains can be severe enough to prevent a diabetic from walking around and can be particularly severe at night while in bed.


Unlike regular muscle cramps where you can see the muscle twitch or contract, diabetic foot cramps aren't always visible to the eye.
Also unlike normal cramping, diabetic foot cramps and pains do not get better or go away with walking.
Diabetes-related foot cramps and pain can sometimes mimic and be misdiagnosed as a stress fracture or Restless Leg Syndrome.

, As high glucose goes into nerves, water follows glucose by osmosis and also goes into nerves. The nerves swell up and they lose their blood supply because they are swollen, so they die a little. If the nerve supplies a muscle and dies then the muscle no longer gets stimulation from that nerve. When the muscle is no longer getting nerve stimulation it atrophies (shrivels up). As a consequence, your feet might look a little smaller (shriveled) and the weakness might affect your gait (how you walk) and make you a little unstable or wobbly. Seeing long-term diabetics walking with canes or in wheelchairs is not unusual.


In conjunction to foot and ankle weakness, the nerves that give feedback to your brain for coordination and balance are also damaged, so walking quickly becomes a real difficult task among diabetics.
The damage to nerves and weakness of ankle muscles / tendons also leads to reduced reflexes. As such, tapping the Achilles tendon in diabetics triggers only a weak response (twitch of the foot) at best.

, If the muscles of your feet are weak and your gait is altered, it will likely cause you to walk abnormally and put additional pressure on your toes. Additional pressure and unusual shifts in weight can lead to foot deformities, such as hammertoes.A hammertoe occurs when one of the three toes in the middle of your foot becomes misshapen at the distal joint, making it bent looking or hammer-like. In addition to deformities like hammertoe, this uneven gait and balance can cause certain areas of the foot to be under more pressure than normal. This can result in pressure ulcers, which can then be infected, which can lead to a host of problems.


Hammertoes can sometimes resolve themselves with time, but usually surgery is needed to correct them.
A common deformity of the big toe often seen in diabetics is a bunion, which is caused when the big toe is constantly pushed towards the other toes.
It's particularly important for diabetics to wear shoes with lots of space for their toes in order to reduce the risk of deformities. Women, in particular, should never wear high-heels if they're diabetic.

, Aside from falling and breaking a bone while walking, the most serious complication a diabetic faces is an injury to their feet.Due to the often lack of sensation, diabetics don't often feel minor injuries such as abrasions, small cuts, blisters or insect bites. As a result, these minor injuries can become infected and potentially lead to the loss of toes or an entire foot if not treated in time.


Visual signs of an infection include significant swelling, discoloration (red or bluish hues) and the leaking of whitish pus or other fluid from the wound.
Infections usually start to smell badly as soon as the wound seeps pus and blood.
Chronic diabetics also have reduced abilities to heal as their immune systems are weakened. Consequently, minor injuries linger for much longer, which increases the likelihood of infection.
If a minor injury turns into a serious-looking open ulcer (like a large canker sore), medical attention is required immediately.
It is recommend that diabetics check the bottom of their feet once a week or so and that their doctor performs a close inspection of their feet at all checkups.

, Although peripheral neuropathy typically begins in the lower limbs, specifically the feet, it also eventually effects the smaller peripheral nerves that innervate the fingers, hands and arms.As such, be vigilant about checking your hands for the above-mentioned potential symptoms and complications of diabetes.


Similar to the stocking-like distribution of diabetic foot symptoms, complications in the upper limbs progress in a glove-like pattern (from the hands and then up the arms).
Diabetic-related symptoms in the hands can mimic or be misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or Raynaud’s disease (arteries that narrow more than normal when exposed to cold temperatures).
It's much easier to check and be aware of your hands on a regular basis compared to your feet because your feet are often encased in socks and shoes.

, The autonomic system includes the nerves that automatically control your heart rate, bladder, lungs, stomach, intestines, genitals and eyes. Diabetes (hyperglycemia) can affect these nerves and cause a variety of complications, such as: increased heart rate, hypotension, urinary retention or incontinence, constipation, bloating, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and vaginal dryness.Uncontrolled sweating (or complete lack of sweating) in the feet or other parts of the body is a sign of autonomic neuropathy.
Widespread autonomic neuropathy eventually causes organ dysfunction, such as heart disease and kidney failure.

, Both peripheral and autonomic neuropathies affect the eyes, as does the destruction of small blood vessels due to glucose toxicity.In addition to the concern of infection and potential foot / leg amputation, going blind is often the biggest fear of diabetics. Eye complications related to diabetes include difficulty adapting to low-light conditions, blurry vision, watery eyes and gradual reduced visual acuity leading to blindness.


Diabetic retinopathy affects blood vessels in the eye's retina and is the most common cause of vision loss among diabetics.
In fact, adult diabetics are 2-5x more likely than those without diabetes to develop cataracts.Diabetic eye disease also increases the risk of developing cataracts (clouding of the lens) and glaucoma (increased pressure and damaged optic nerve).

Avoid injury behind your heel.",How to Avoid Heel Pain and Plantar Fasciitis," The plantar fascia is a ligament that consists of a thick band of tissue that runs from the heel bone to the toe area.The plantar fascia ligament provides support for the natural arch in your feet.Injury to the plantar fascia is the primary reason for heel pain. Plantar fasciitis is caused by damage to the ligament, causing it to become swollen, weakened, and irritated or inflamed.;
, Select shoes that fit well all around, have shanks and solid heel counters built in, and provide good support.A shank is a supportive strip that runs along the bottom of the shoe. It is not visible, so it is difficult to tell if the shoe manufacturer included a shank in the design. If the shoe is flimsy, and easy to bend in the middle, then it probably does not have a shank.The heel counter is also not visible, but the presence of a solid heel counter can be determined by pressing inward on the middle, upper area of the back part of the shoe. If it easily collapses to the inside, then the heel counter is not very strong. The more rigid and supportive the heel counter is, the more difficult it will be to push the upper back part of the shoe toward the inside sole., Prevent heel pain and plantar fasciitis by discarding shoes with worn soles and heels.Worn soles and heels contribute to an uneven step with heel counters that have lost some of their support. Discard old shoes and replace with new ones that have the proper support., Everybody likes to go without shoes at times, but limit the time you walk around without proper footwear.Walking barefoot significantly increases your risk of damaging the ligament that naturally supports your arches which can lead to heel pain and plantar fasciitis., The importance of stretches cannot be over-emphasized.Tight calf muscles can contribute to heel pain. The Achilles tendon stretches from the bone in the heel into the calf area. Flexibility in this area can be improved by properly stretching before and after exercise.Performing exercises that stretch your feet can help to maintain the integrity of the plantar fascia ligament and prevent heel pain.Do three stretching exercises for your feet before and after exercising. The first involves standing with your hands placed on a wall and the toes of one foot also against the wall.Place one foot back, and keep your heel on the ground as you lean into the wall. Hold this for 30 seconds, switch legs and repeat.You can also follow the straight leg stretch by bending your back leg slightly. By doing the stretch both ways you will be able to stretch two different muscles in the back of your calf, the soleus and the gastrocnemius.
While seated and without shoes, hold your toes and gently pull them upward until you can feel the arch of your foot stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, switch feet, and repeat.Place a towel or cloth object on the floor, grab the object with your toes, and pull it towards you. Hold the grasp for 30 seconds, switch feet and repeat., At the first sign of pain, apply ice to the bottom of your foot and heel.One method to apply ice to the bottom of your foot and heel area while standing with support is to gently roll a frozen 12 to 16 ounce water bottle along the bottom of your foot., If your job requires constant standing, take measures to provide anti-fatigue matting to help prevent heel pain and take care of your plantar fascia ligaments., If you are overweight, take steps to lose weight. Your feet and heels will be healthier if the load they carry is lighter.People that are overweight are at greater risk of developing heel pain and plantar fasciitis. The more weight you are carrying on your feet, the more likely they are to suffer as the years go by., Overdoing physical activity takes its toll on your body, including your feet.Pace yourself during exercise. If you are starting a new sport or physical activity, increase your activity level gradually to avoid sudden strain on your muscles and abrupt added stress on your feet.Avoid foot injury from heavy landings from jumping. If jumping is involved in your sport or exercise routine, take care to provide shoes that provide the proper support.

, Elevate your feet if possible, especially shortly after exercise, to prevent fluid accumulations and allow your feet to rest., Once heel pain begins, or if you have a history of plantar fasciitis, see a foot doctor to evaluate the condition and recommend treatment options.Do not ignore heel pain. Once it starts, it can get worse - and when it gets worse, it can be excruciating. You may be contributing to the damage by waiting to seek treatment.
Pain from plantar fasciitis often is felt with the first steps of the day. Your doctor can prescribe medications and therapies that can help to treat the problem., See your doctor if your symptoms are not improving, getting worse, or if your pain is sudden and severe.Medical attention is warranted if the area becomes reddened or swollen, or if you are not able to put any weight on your foot., It may prove helpful in reducing the pain and allowing the area to heal by taking weight off the foot by using some type of support while walking.Reduce walking as much as possible for 7 to 10 days., Upon recommendation by your doctor, custom orthotics may help to treat the condition, reduce the pain, and help to prevent any further damage.Custom orthotics are inserts designed specifically to help establish a solid foundation based on the problems you are having with your feet.
There is some controversy about custom-fitted orthotics primarily surrounding their high cost and lack of scientific research that support their use.Many doctors recommend trying heel supports that can be purchased at a local drugstore before investing in custom orthotics., In some cases, prescription medications and/or steroid injections may help to reduce the inflammation and help to manage the pain.The most common over-the-counter medication group recommended are those that are considered anti-inflammatory agents. Medications that fall in this group include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the use of any prescription or over-the-counter medications.

, Use a belt or towel wrapped around the ball of the foot, and pull on both sides of the belt to stretch the ball and top of the foot towards the body.Stretching the foot, plantar fascia ligament, and heel area in this manner reduces the pain felt with the first mornings steps., For people that experience intense pain with their first steps in the morning, using night splints can help to reduce the pain and assist with mobility.Night splints provide consistent pressure, keeping the foot and heel in a somewhat strained position. By doing so, the first morning steps are much less painful as the muscles and ligaments involved are healing., Working with a physical therapist can help to improve your functioning so that you can bear weight on your injured foot and reduce the amount of pain.Recent work suggests that manual manipulation of the foot by a trained physical therapist may be helpful in restoring mobility., If other measures have not worked for you, then your doctor may recommend corticosteroid injections. These injections can provide some temporary pain relief, but they are not recommended as a long-term solution since repeat injections can damage the plantar fascia., Heel pain often goes ignored, which allows the underlying problem to worsen.If rest is possible, many conditions that cause heel pain may resolve on their own. But since most people do not have the option to stay off their feet for a week or so, the condition often continues to develop, leading to more pain and discomfort.While plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, it is not the only possible condition that can cause discomfort in your heel area., Common causes of heel pain can be broadly divided into two areas. Those areas include problems that cause pain beneath the heel, and those that cause pain behind the heel.Common problems that cause pain beneath the heel, other than plantar fasciitis, include stone bruises and heel spurs.Stone bruises occur when you step on something small and solid that bruises the fat pad on the bottom of your foot beneath your heel.This type of injury will gradually get better with rest, and staying off your feet as much as possible for the time recommended by your doctor.Other medical conditions can also lead to pain in this area, such as infection, neuropathic pain, nerve pain from S1 radiculopathy and entrapment syndromes, such as entrapment of nerves in the tunnels of the foot., This type of injury can be avoided by wearing shoes instead of going barefoot.Selecting shoes with thick and flexible soles can also help to prevent this type of injury by preventing small, hard objects from penetrating through to your heel area., Heel spurs are small, bony protrusions made of calcium deposits that can be seen on X-ray. In many cases, heel spurs are caused by chronic cases of plantar fasciitis.The treatment of a heel spur is the same as that for plantar fasciitis, which includes rest, stretching exercises, heel inserts in some cases, and wearing properly fitting supportive shoes.Heel spurs can be avoided by seeking early treatment for heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis, and by taking the same preventive measures.Some of those measures include consistently wearing supportive shoes, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding excessive physical activity, using anti-fatigue matting if you must stand for long periods of time or on concrete floors, and getting enough rest., Your doctor can determine the cause of your pain.In some cases, you may have inflamed the area that connects the Achilles tendon to the heel bone. If treatment is delayed, the area may become thickened, red, and swollen.The condition may progress to include tenderness and warmth to the touch, and may become too painful to wear normal shoes.Your doctor may recommend heel inserts of a specific height to avoid continued irritation, stretching exercises, taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, wearing open-back shoes until the area is healing, applying ice to the area, and rest., This type of injury often occurs from running, or other active sports, without wearing the proper footwear.Wearing shoes that fit properly, prevent your foot from sliding in and out easily, and those with supportive heel counters can help to avoid developing this type of heel pain."

Lose some weight, especially if you're obese.,
Stop smoking.,
Be more physically active.,
Wear compression stockings.,
Drink more uncaffeinated fluids.,
Get a leg massage.,
Try acupuncture treatments.,
Consider vibration therapy.,
See your family physician.,
Get a referral to a specialist.,
Talk to your doctor about more powerful medications.",How to Avoid Getting Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)," The risk of DVT is much greater if you are overweight or obese.The additional weight makes it more difficult to circulate blood around the body, particularly back to the heart from the feet and legs. Consequently, the increase in blood pressure tends to damage blood vessels and promote the formation of plaques and clots. Losing weight makes it easier on your heart and blood vessels, thus reducing the risks of DVT and atherosclerosis.


Lose weight by increasing cardiovascular exercise (such as walking) and decreasing your caloric consumption.
Reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories daily will result in about 4 pounds of fat tissue loss per month.;
, The risk of DVT is also greater if you are a chronic cigarette smoker.Various compounds and additives in cigarettes negatively affect blood clotting, blood vessels and circulation in general — essentially by making your blood thicker and hypercoagulating — which increases your risk of DVT and other vascular diseases.Try to stop smoking gradually (with the help of nicotine patches), cold turkey and/or with the help of suggestive subliminal tapes or hypnotherapy.


When a blood clot breaks loose within a vein and begins moving through the bloodstream, it becomes an embolism, which can get stuck in the vessels supplying the lung or heart. This can lead to instant death in some cases. Only a fraction (10-15%) of people with a pulmonary embolism die from it shortly thereafter.Approximately 2,000,000 Americans experience a DVT each year and smoking is a significant causative factor., Being sedentary for long periods of time is a risk factor for DVT, so increase your cardiovascular exercise by walking, jogging, cycling or swimming.Your calf muscles can act like a secondary heart in a sense, helping to pump the blood in the leg veins back up to your actual heart, but only if they are contracting from some type of exercise on a fairly regular basis.


If you're seated while working or flying on a plane and can't exercise properly for hours at a time, then at least move your legs and feet around periodically while you're seated.
Being immobile with a cast on a broken leg is especially risky for DVT, so try to frequently wiggle your toes while your leg is kept elevated.
The most common signs and symptoms of DVT include: swelling, redness and pain in the calf or lower leg (especially along the path of a vein), difficulty weight bearing (especially running), and skin that feels warm or hot to touch.Symptoms may be subtle. Half of patients with DVT have no symptoms when diagnosed., Compression stockings provide support to muscles and blood vessels of the lower leg, which reduces edema / swelling, as well as the risk of DVT. Compression stockings are particularly important for people who have venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves) or varicose veins.The stockings should reach to your knee or higher, but may or may not have closed toes. They are found online, at medical supply stores and sometimes at pharmacies or physiotherapist offices.


Purchase class 1 stockings, which exert the lightest pressure, unless your doctor recommends class 2 or 3 compression stockings.
Use graduated compression stockings during times of high risk such as car, bus and plane travel. Graduated compression stockings, sometimes sold as ""elastic flight socks,"" are tighter at your ankle than your thigh, which increases the speed of blood flow.

, Keeping well hydrated impacts your blood volume and ""thins"" it out somewhat, which can reduce your risk of DVT. As such, drink plenty of purified water and fresh fruit juices, especially if you live in a hot and/or dry climate.Avoid caffeine-rich liquids such as coffee, black tea, soda pop and energy drinks because caffeine is a diuretic, which stimulates excessive urination and tends to dehydrate your body with time.


During the summer months, try to drink a gallon of water on a daily basis.
Remember that most fresh fruit and veggies are great sources of water also.

, Get a massage therapist or sympathetic friend to give you a calf and thigh muscle massage as a preventative measure for DVT. Massage reduces muscle tension and promotes better blood and lymph fluid circulation.Start rubbing from the lower calf and progress up to the thigh so you help the venous blood return back to the heart. Begin with a 30-minute massage and go from there. Allow the therapist (or friend) to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
If you have an acute, symptomatic DVT (swollen and tender), then a deep tissue massage might be contraindicated, so talk with your doctor.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation, and promote better circulation.Acupuncture for reducing the risks of circulatory issues in the leg may be effective, although it's not commonly recommended by medical doctors. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce discomfort.


Acupuncture points that may help your leg symptoms are not all located near in your leg — some can be in distant parts of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, An interesting alternative option for potentially reducing the risk of circulatory problems developing in the legs is vibration therapy. By placing your feet on or in a vibrational device, multiple small contractions occur deep within the calf and thigh muscles, which help to push the blood through all the small veins.Vibrating frequencies also seem to relax and strengthen musculature while stimulating nerves to reduce pain.


Full-body vibrating machines are difficult to find in rehabilitation facilities and likely too expensive to buy for home use, so consider smaller machines that vibrate just your feet and/or lower legs.
A hand-held vibrating massage device is another option that may work well to stimulate the muscles of your leg.
If you have an acute, symptomatic DVT, then vibrational therapy might be contraindicated, so talk with your doctor before you experiment.

, Despite efforts to avoid a DVT, if your leg (especially your calf) becomes swollen, red and tender to touch and it doesn't resolve itself within a few days, then make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will examine your leg and foot and ask questions about your family history, diet and recent travel routine. If female, your doctor might also ask if you're pregnant, recently gave birth, taking birth control pills or undergoing hormone replacement therapy because higher levels of estrogen can easily precipitate blood clotting.The birth control pill is riskiest during the first year of use, although modern formulas tend to be much safer than their predecessors several decades ago.
Your doctor may prescribe a blood thinner (anticoagulant) such as heparin if he/she suspects a DVT. Blood thinners decrease your blood's ability to clot, although they don't break up existing blood clotsYour family doctor is not a circulatory specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.

, A circulatory specialist or vascular surgeon is trained to distinguish between all the potential vascular issues that can occur in the leg and elsewhere. There are a number of serious conditions that cause leg swelling and pain including diabetic neuropathy, venous insufficiency (leaky vein valves of the lower leg), chronic compartment syndrome (swelling of the lower leg muscles), popliteal artery entrapment, bacterial infections and cellulitis.Your specialist may use a diagnostic ultrasound to try to see clots in the upper leg, or a venography (x-ray with injected dye) to test for clots in the lower leg. Ultrasounds are compared over time to see if a clot has grown or reduced.
The specialist may also conduct a D-dimer blood test to detect if a clot exists. D-dimer is a chemical that is produced when a clot gradually dissolves.

, If a DVT is detected, then your doctor may decide to give you stronger, more powerful drugs to stop the clot's progression and then to ultimately dissolve it. After starting heparin injections, you might be given other injectable blood thinners (such as enoxaparin) or pills such as warfarin (Coumadin).If you have a serious, high-risk DVT, your doctor may give you a thrombolytic-type drug via an intravenous line, which can quickly dissolve a clot.


You may be prescribed a new oral medication that has been recently approved by the FDA that does not require blood monitoring, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Commonly used thrombolytic agents for DVT include streptokinase, urokinase and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA).Thrombolytics can trigger serious internal bleeding and are traditionally used on DVT that are considered life-threatening, although these drugs have evolved considerably in recent years, prompting discussion as to whether they should be used on all types of DVT.If you cannot take blood thinners, your doctor may have a small filter surgically placed in a vein in your abdomen, preventing clots from moving to areas where they could cause harm.If you're in the hospital, a mechanical device for compressing your feet or legs may be used for a few days. These are especially useful in conjunction with blood thinners."

Although it can be a competitive industry that comes with some demands, there are many benefits to working as a dietitian.It requires an incredible amount of knowledge. You’ll need to know about everything from biochemistry to anatomy to food preparation.Helping someone get healthy or make proper food choices can be incredibly rewarding for you and them.
It comes with some emotional demands. You’ll have to positively navigate all kinds of personal dynamics from patients to family members and other healthcare providers.There are many avenues a dietitian can go down once she is registered. Once you have completed an internship, you will have a better idea of in which avenue you feel most comfortable.;
, Before you begin taking steps to become a registered dietitian, you first need to assess your abilities and education. Taking an objective view of what you have to offer can help you decide if being a dietitian is the right for you.An excellent way to consider your ability to be a dietitian is to think about an experience you’ve had with one. You could also contact a dietitian and see if you could discuss it as a career or even shadow her for a day to get a better sense of the work.
You will need at least a bachelor’s degree, possibly a graduate degree, as well as at least 1200 hours of supervised practice and successful passing of a national exam.This might be too much of a time commitment for some people, or may not be the right choice if you aren’t a strong student.
Learn about how long it takes to be successful. It can take years to get the education and experience to become a registered dietitian. It may also take years to build up a client base or find a good job.Knowing the commitment up front can help you relax and make the process of becoming a dietitian more easy and enjoyable.
You need at least a bachelor’s degree and course through an accredited dietetics program.This will require courses in biochemistry, anatomy, human nutrition, psychology, and biology.You need to complete at least 1200 hours of supervised practice under an accredited dietitian or dietetic organization., Consider how being a dietitian will affect your lifestyle and even that of your family. Knowing whether or not the time, emotional, and physical aspects fit in with your lifestyle is important if you want to become a dietitian and be successful at it.Are you able to handle the physical demands? Depending on where you work, you may need to stand or sit for long hours.
Does dietary work fit your personality? Working with patients and other people is a significant part of the job. If you like working with and helping people, being a dietitian may be an excellent choice for you.

, Dietitians earn on average about $55,000 per year. This amount can change depending on your experience and location. Proceed with your plans to be a registered dietician if the average pay meets your financial requirements.The average salary for a registered dietitian works out to $26.56 per hour, which is significantly above the minimum wage.Private practice dietitians tend to make the most money as they are in business for themselves, control their schedules and keep all of the revenue for their services.
Remember that you will have to pay taxes and other fees for your salary, but that you will also get health benefits and vacation and sick time.
There is significant growth in the field of dietetics.Current projects forecast a growth rate of 20% between 2010 and 2020, which means there should be ample opportunities to find a job., At a bare minimum, you need a bachelor’s degree to work as a registered dietitian. Consider a degree in dietetics, food science, nutrition, or another related field such as biology. This can help ensure you not only understand the various aspects of being a dietitian, but may also expedite furthering your education.The coursework should be approved by the Accreditation Counsel for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND).The curriculum will vary between schools, but most cover the following subjects to some degree:Food and Nutrition Sciences
Biochemistry
Culinary Arts
Foodservice Systems Management
Business
Microbiology
Sociology
Physiology
Microbiology
Psychology
If you have a bachelor’s degree in a related field, you may want to get a master’s degree or PhD to be a dietitian.

, Irrespective of education, every person who wants to work as dietitian must complete an internship. Your supervised practice must be accredited by the ACEND and meet certain time requirements.You must do at least 1200 hours of internship, which is the equivalent of about six to 12 months.You can do your internship a healthcare facility, community agency, or at a foodservice corporation.If you want to specialize in a specific type of dietetics, such as for obese patients, you may want to consider this for your internship.There are over 250 accredited programs in North America and opportunities through the world. You can find a list of professionals with whom to intern at the website of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Their website is can be found here.
Keep in mind that dietetic internships are very competitive and selective. You'll want to be armed with three internships that you'd like and be prepared to write extensive applications/essays/projects for each one.

, Before you can work as a registered dietitian, you must pass the national exam. The exam is administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) and you may only take it once you have successfully completed an undergraduate degree program and a supervised internship.The program director of your internship will give you details on preparing for the test and application process.
You may want to purchase study aids or join a study group to improve your chances of passing.
If you fail the exam, you may retest only 45 days after your unsuccessful exam., Dietetics is a wide field and there are many institutions in which you can find a job as a registered dietitian. Finding a job as a Dietitian can be tricky, but there are usually a host of jobs available at any given time. Most dietitians start in the clinical field (hospitals). You may also consider starting your own private practice. Sending out applications to different kinds of places can help you find your dream job.Dietitians can work in a variety of industries including food service management, government, education, research, and the private sector.
Look for jobs at universities, hospitals, cafeterias, nursing homes, and schools.You can also work as a private contractor, which will allow you to get experience in a bunch of different areas as well as let you pick and choose when and for whom you work.
Consider starting your own private practice once you have some experience. You should build up a client base before taking this step, but it can offer you even more freedom.

, In order to maintain your certification, you must complete continuing education throughout the time that you are a dietetic practitioner. This can help you stay on top of new research and trends in your field.It is mandatory to complete 75 credit hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every five years in order to maintain your RD status.You can take a wide variety of continuing education courses or participate in workshops that will help you improve on and update your skills and knowledge over time.

, Whether it's a company meeting or someone's birthday, you'll probably eat out a few times for lunch. Try to stick to healthier options when you're eating out. Remember, restaurant food is generally higher in calories.


If you do eat in a restaurant or cafeteria, look for smaller portions. Do they offer half a sandwich with a salad or cup of soup?
Look for the foods that are lower in calories, such as salads.
Split an entree with a friend. This will automatically cut your portion in half and limit the calories you consume. This is also a good idea if you're in the mood for something more indulgent.
Ask your server to box up half your entree before it arrives. If it's out of sight, it'll be out of mind.
Research the restaurant and menu prior to arriving. This will help you determine what healthy options are available. Arriving prepared will help keep you from falling for the temptations of specials and help to keep you on track with your healthy eating plan.

, Big meals, or ones that are high in carbohydrates like pasta or pizza, can make you feel tired, foggy and groggy — like a ""food coma"" — in the afternoon. This can trigger more snacking afterwards for a needed jolt of energy.


Avoid the afternoon slump by skipping these larger meals and sticking to your healthier packed lunch.
Still feeling tired after lunch? Take a quick walk to wake you up! This will revitalize your brain without the extra snack calories.

, You will need a snack once in awhile, especially if you work long hours or there's more than four to five hours between any two of your meals. If you can't rely on healthy vending machine choices, pack your own snacks. That way, you won't be tempted by sugary treats!


Snacks should always contain protein and a fruit or vegetable. This power team gives you the needed energy and fuel to keep you going through your busy day.Snacks should also be ""snack"" sized, not a mini meal. Stick will pre-portioned snacks or give yourself a calorie limit like 200 calories per snack.
Healthy snack options include things like: carrots and hummus, a low-fat cheese stick and an apple, celery sticks with peanut butter or low-fat yogurt with fruit.

, Candy bowls, vending machines and break rooms can be loaded with tempting sweets and other high calorie treats. Skip those options and stick to your packed lunch and snacks.


Do not keep your own candy bowl or drawer in your office. If it's hard to keep your hand out of your co-worker's candy jar, avoid walking by their desk or take a different route to your destination.
Don't look into the vending machine. Even with the best intentions, sometimes even glancing at that candy bar might be too tempting to resist. Don't tease yourself and stick to your plan.

, A minimum of eight glasses or 64 oz (2 liters) of clear, sugar-free liquids like water, iced tea or no-calorie flavored waters will help you maintain a healthy diet and body. Often, dehydration feels like hunger and tempts you to snack or eat more than you should.Monitor the volume of liquids you consume by purchasing a labeled water bottle. This will help you track and achieve your water goal throughout the day.
Even mild dehydration has side effects. Many times, dehydration can cause afternoon fatigue and grogginess.Prevent this by sipping all day long.
Stay away from sodas and sugary drinks. They're very tempting, and can help you stay awake while working, but they are full of empty calories in the form of sugar. If you still need the caffeine, consider coffee or tea with skim milk and limited sweetener.

, Spend some time going through your desk, cubby or locker and remove any treats or tempting foods you may have hidden away. Once all the candy, chips and crackers are gone, you can replace those items with healthier snacks.


Stock up your desk drawer or locker with healthy, shelf-stable snack foods. Low-calorie protein bars, sturdy fruits like apples or portion-controlled bags of nuts are good options to have on hand.
Make a list of healthy snacks you want to have for the week. Then, each weekend, you can shop and prepare your healthy snacks and bring your week's worth each Monday morning.

, Birthdays and holiday parties often present many opportunities to overindulge, especially if the treats are then left hanging out in the break room all day to tempt you! If the party is a potluck, bring something healthy, like veggies and dip or a big salad. If it's not a potluck, be sure you have your own healthy snacks you can enjoy while socializing. This may help you avoid the cake, cookies, and other high-calorie foods., There are a variety of side effects associated with sitting too long — anything from weight gain and back problems to loss of muscle mass and softening of your bones.To prevent these health conditions, move around every hour. Don't let yourself get caught too long at your desk without moving.


Set a timer on your phone or computer to help remind you to move.
Drink lots and lots of water. The more water you drink, the more often you'll be up using the restroom.
Give yourself a goal to get up and move at least five to eight times a day and keep track of your progress each week.

, Pedometers and fitness bands are a popular ways to monitor how much you step and move throughout the day. Aiming for at least 10,000 steps or about five miles a day may help you lose or maintain your weight and help keep you in shape.Find ways to walk more throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away, get up to deliver a message instead of emailing it or walk to a bathroom further away from your desk.
Download a free app on your phone, purchase an affordable pedometer or spring for a fitness watch or band for a fun way to track your daily steps.
10,000 steps should be your ultimate goal each day. If you're not there yet, creep up on the ultimate goal by setting mini-goals over time. For example, increase your steps by 200, 500, or 1,000 each day until you have met and surpassed the ultimate goal on an ongoing basis.

, You don't need a gym or running shoes to put a little exercise in your day. Try chair exercises and other small exercises you can do comfortably at your desk. Spend 10 – 15 minutes on your lunch break doing doing these activities to help break the routine of sitting and limit the unhealthy effects of sitting so long. There are many sites online that offer ideas for exercising in your chair.Review your schedule the day before and see if you can fit in just a few minutes of exercise — 10 minutes before a meeting or a 20 minutes during some down time. Schedule it so you remember!
De-stress after a long meeting with a quick yoga routine. It requires little to no equipment and you won't need to worry about getting too sweaty.
Try standing as you type or send emails. Standing is better for your posture and helps engage more muscle groups than sitting.

, Take a few minutes daily to increase your heart rate and raise your breathing to a faster pace. Quick cardio moves can help burn calories through your day. In addition, these little sessions can help bring you out of an afternoon slump!


Try taking a walking meeting with a co-worker instead of talking at a desk.

Take walks at lunchtime or before or after work. Get out and walk around the building, or the block. Get some natural sunlight if weather permits. If the weather is crummy, visit the nearest stairwell for a workout.
Run in place at your desk or do a few knee raises or jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.

, If you don't have time for a gym trip, add some simple weight lifting exercises to your week. Just two to three days a week is a good goal. Strength training helps build muscle, burn calories and keeps you fit!


Consider buying a small set of weights for bicep curls, lateral raises or shoulder presses. Or find office furniture to help do some isometric activities like wall push-ups, tricep dips from a stable chair or sitting leg raises. Change out your desk chair for a fitness stability ball to help strengthen core muscles.

, Do a couple of squats, bicep curls or stretches., This is a great option for more activity at work. You can either walk or stand as you do work!


Set a goal for yourself each day. For example, walk 2,000 steps every hour or stand for one hour before sitting for 30 mins.
Ask your office manager or HR department if they'd split the cost with you since these desks can be a little expensive.

, No matter what health goal you have, having a support group in place is key for long-term success. Whether it's your spouse, family, friends or co-workers, a support group is made up of your ""cheerleaders,"" who will motivate and encourage your progress.


If friends and family don't jump on your healthy weight loss bandwagon, think about finding an online support group or a local group to meet up with. Email new friends that share your long-term goals.
You can even sign up for diet programs like Weight Watchers just to go to their weekly support group meetings. You'll meet plenty of other dieters on the same mission.

, You're probably not the only one in your office that's interested in getting healthier. Find some like-minded co-workers and make a club or group that's focused on weight loss. They'll be a great support and can also help improve the overall office environment. If everyone is trying to eat healthier, there may be less sweet treats hanging around.


Get competitive with your co-workers. See who can get the most steps or pack their lunches the most days in a row! A little friendly competition or a fun prize is always a good motivator.
Your new group can also be great way to get out of the office for a quick lunch break walk. Everyone needs a few minutes away from their desk! Take advantage of this and bring your group outside for a walk.
Swap healthy recipes and meal ideas with your group. Recipe ruts can lead you right back to old habits of eating out. Creating a recipe swap with your weight loss group can help keep things spiced up in the kitchen.

, It's easy to write up some goals, but it can be difficult to put your new lifestyle changes into practice. Finding ways to stay accountable and measure your progress is essential to long-term success. That means weighing yourself regularly, counting your daily steps, or keeping a food journal (no matter what you eat — even a little bite of something should be recorded!).


Consider what you need for your accountability. Maybe you need to purchase a scale or download a food journal app on your phone. Make sure you have these items in place prior to starting your lifestyle changes.
Telling a friend or family member about your goals is another great method of staying accountable. Knowing that other people are aware of your goals and are aware of your actions can help keep you on track.

, Even with better eating and snack habits at work, weight gain can come from habits outside of your office as well. Spend some time evaluating your behaviors at home. Do you eat large portions at dinner? Do you typically get takeout or fast food? Do you eat dessert or snacks after dinner? These habits can sabotage the good work you're doing at your office.


Take some time and write out some habits you have at home that might be preventing you from losing weight or contributing to weight gain. Add these to your lifestyle changes at work to make sure you have a well-rounded plan of action.
Apply the same healthy eating habits to your meals and snacks at home. Focus on protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains as much as possible. Also, make sure your portions are appropriate.
Fit in additional physical activity outside of work. Spend a couple days of the week doing some cardio and two to three days on strength training. Aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.Even if you move around more at work, if you do not exercise at least 150 minutes per week then weight gain is inevitable.

, Look up your BMI using a chart like this one: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.pdf A BMI that is over 25 means you're overweight and weight loss could be beneficial.


Using that same chart, find the weight for your height that would put you into a healthy BMI category for 19 – 24.9. Subtract that healthy weight from your current weight to see about how much weight you should lose.
Speak to your doctor about your weight and weight loss plan to make sure it's a healthy and safe option for you. Ask your doctor for a referral to see a registered dietitian who can help you plan meals, helping you lose weight while making sure you get all the nutrients necessary to stay healthy and energetic.

, First set your ultimate weight loss goal, like 10 or 25 pounds. Then set smaller goals along the way. For example, you might want to lose 20 pounds in the next three months and you're going to lose 1– 2 pounds each week.


Make sure to set safe, realistic weight loss goals. Weight loss of more than 1 – 2 pounds per week is generally not safe, healthy or sustainable long-term.Invest in a home scale so you can accurately weigh yourself each day or week.
Make a chart or record where you can track your progress. This will help you stay motivated and accountable to yourself as you go along.

, Aside from weight loss, what other health-related goals do you have? Maybe you'd like to drink less soda, exercise more often or eat more fruits and vegetables? Generally, some characteristics about your lifestyle will change in order to lose weight. Goals like these will not only help you lose weight, but also improve your overall health.


Write out each of your goals ensuring they are very specific, realistic and have a time limit. For example, ""I'm going to exercise three days a week for 45 minutes for the next three months.""
Choose one goal at a time. If you try to change multiple things in your life all at one time, it can be difficult, overwhelming and frustrating. Stick to one or two changes every week or so for long-term success.
Keep a journal to log your successes and challenges. Write about how easy or difficult some of these changes are.

Take the plunge.,
Have fun.,
Turn your commute into exercise.,
Try to exercise at the same time each day.,
Punctuate your day with physical activity.,
Use walking as a form of stealth exercise.",How to Be Motivated to Exercise1," The real trick to motivating yourself to exercise is to not think about it, and just throw yourself into it. Taking action and getting moving can stimulate a response in you emotionally and encourage you to keep at it. You might be dreading going for a run or lifting some weights, but generally once you’re going your feelings will change.


Exercise allows more oxygen into your brain, which in turn releases more chemicals that make you feel good.
Once you’re exercising you will have more positive feelings, and your mood will improve.This is why exercise is a great natural anti-depressant, and is often recommended for people suffering from mild depression.;
, One of the most important factors in maintaining your motivation is finding something that you actually enjoy doing. Exercise shouldn’t be a chore that you have to force yourself to do. It might start out like that, but finding forms of exercise that you like will make a huge difference in getting motivated. Keep an open mind and try new things.


Don’t be put off by the memory of freezing cold cross-country runs when you were at school — there’s more to exercise than this.
You could do anything from a ballroom dancing class, to badminton, horse riding, or martial arts.
When you find something fun, keep it in your routine, but still look for some variety., This won’t be possible for everyone, but if you live within running or cycling distance to where you work, turn your commute into part of your exercise routine. Often people struggle to put time aside to exercise, but by exercising on your way to and from work you are being active without having to set aside any extra time.Running or cycling to and from work will also help you clear your mind in preparation for, or to recover from, a stressful day in the office.
Cycling to work is a great workout and will help you get into the habit of cycling and exercising more generally., If you are busy it can be tough to find time to exercise, but you are more likely to stick to it if you firmly book it into your schedule. Go through your diary carefully and try to carve out a regular window that is free most weeks, if not every week. If you do exercise at the same time and on the same days every week, you have a better chance of maintaining it.Sooner or later the exercise will become as deeply embedded in your schedule as everything else.
You’ll even find yourself looking forward to it as a break from the everyday grind.

Habits and routines take a while to form, but they can be very powerful once they are in place., A good way to get more exercise in your day is just to add in little bits of physical activity whenever you can. Making small changes can add up to a big change in the long-term, as well as helping you change your outlook and get more used to being physically active. Some examples of small changes you can make include:Taking the stairs instead of using the elevator
Walking or cycling to the shops instead of driving
Taking a brisk walk when you have a break at work

, Put yourself in a position where you have to walk and don't think about it being a form of exercise. This could be done by getting off the bus a few stops earlier to home or work, or by walking anywhere you can in a reasonable distance such as to the grocery store, school, the post office, or a friend's house.


For example, you could park further from stores so that you have further to walk to start shopping.
The more often you do this the easier it will become as you get used to it.

"
"
Get an exercise partner.,
Do team sports.,
Make friends at the gym.,
Join a club.,
Participate in an online community.",How to Be Motivated to Exercise2," A great way to get motivated and stick to a workout routine is to involve other people. If you and a friend both want to get into shape, you can exercise together and motivate each other to stick with it. Some days you won’t be feeling up to it, and some days your workout partner won’t be. Having this support and added motivation can really make a difference.Exercising with other people can also make it just more fun.
Try to figure out a schedule that you can both stick to.
Working out with a partner gives you added support and a feeling of camaraderie.
Not wanting to let down your friend can also be an added source of motivation.
You might also benefit from a little friendly rivalry and competition., If you find doing individual exercise like running or swimming a little monotonous or boring, consider participating in some team sports. Here you will get the benefits of added fun and motivation from exercising with others, while also playing a sport that has more variation than just running or swimming backwards and forwards.


Playing team sports is also a social activity, and associating exercise with seeing friends and having fun makes it easier to motivate yourself to stick with it.

, Another way to make exercise a little more social and a little less daunting is to make the effort to befriend the regulars you see at your gym or fitness classes. If you do a regular spin or yoga class, you will find it easier to motivate yourself to keep going if there is a good atmosphere in the group.


If you are in a group where nobody talks to each other, think about trying out a different class, or even try being the one to start chatting and bringing people together.
Try a few out and see if there is one where people are chatting at the start and the instructor knows everyone’s name., If team sports aren’t your thing, you can still make solo activities, such as running and cycling, into a group activity. Look around for a local running, cycling or swimming club near you. You may be able to join up with a running club that goes for a fairly casual run once a week. By doing this you can avoid the overt competition of team sports, but still get some exercise and make some new friends.

, You can get some the benefits of sharing your experiences with others by joining an online fitness community that is closely related to your own circumstances. If you are trying to exercise to lose weight, you will find loads of forums and websites where people share their stories and progress. Alternatively, if you are training for a specific event, such as a triathlon or marathon, you will find supportive online networks of people doing the same thing.


Participating in an online community is a good way to connect with others and get support if you don’t know anyone in the same situation as you.
You can find a huge variety of online groups, so look around and find a friendly and welcoming forum.
Online groups can set each other goals and report on progress and difficulties just as any face-to-face group would."
"
Establish your goals.,
Make a pledge.,
Record your starting point.,
Track your progress.,
Reward yourself.",How to Be Motivated to Exercise3," Having clearly defined goals will help you follow your progress and reward yourself when you achieve your aims. It’s best to start with relatively straight-forward, short-term goals, and then progress onto more ambitious ones. Start with something achievable to give yourself a welcome confidence boost early, but don’t be satisfied with that, and keep your eyes on the bigger picture.


A short-term goal for someone who hasn’t exercised for quite a while could be to walk 10 minutes a day, five days a week.
The next goal could be to walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week.
A long-term goal could be to complete a 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) walk., Research suggests that we are more likely to stick to plans or schedules if we go a step further than just saying to ourselves, “Okay, I’ll do that this week.” Consider making a more formal pledge to yourself and even putting it on paper and signing it. You can do this with friends and make a pledge to do 30 minutes of exercise, five days a week, for a month. Writing down your goals can help you stay motivated.You can even introduce a cash incentive or penalty.
For example, you might sign a deal with a friend that says if you stop exercising you will pay her $50.
There are even websites that specialise in enabling you to make contracts online, which can improve your chances of sticking to them., If you are specifically looking to exercise more to help you lose weight, be sure you record your starting point so you can check your progress as you go. You might just want to weigh yourself, or take a photo. You could also perform a fitness test, such as seeing how many crunches or squats you can do in a row.


Remember that if you are looking to lose weight, your diet is every bit as important as the amount of exercise you get.

, Keep a log and make note of new times, distances or weight lifted. Seeing a chart of improvement will hopefully keep you working towards gains. Tick off the days and the workouts with gusto and look back to see how far you’ve come and how strong you are. If you see you’ve been exercising regularly for two months, this can help motivate you to keep going. You’ve come this far, why stop now?


You can use all sorts of apps and websites to quickly and easily record your progress.
These digital tools often include nice visualisations so you can see your progress more clearly.
You can also take regular pictures or do weigh-ins to check the results of your hard work.

, It’s important that you reward yourself and congratulate yourself on sticking to your exercise routine. After each workout you will be feeling tired, but good, so take a few minutes to savour the feeling and be proud of yourself. Consider the endorphins released during the workout and remember this great feeling you now have.By giving yourself this kind of internal reward you are reinforcing your positive connection to exercise.
External rewards are good too, so be sure to treat yourself when you reach a major goal.
You could reward yourself by buying some new running shoes after completing your first 10k."
"
Invest in some workout clothes.,
Leave your workout gear out.,
Consider getting a portable music player.,
Try an exercise gadget.",How to Be Motivated to Exercise4," Having some nice workout clothes can be a factor in your exercise motivation. Being comfortable and feeling happy with your appearance when working out is one barrier that can be overcome. Having good workout clothes can also help you identify yourself as someone who exercises.


Have enough clothes that you can exercise daily and don’t have to resort to quick hand washing in the sink., Once you have some workout clothes and sneakers, be sure you don’t hide them away in a cupboard where they are out of sight and out of mind. Leave them somewhere visible so you have frequent visual cues and reminders to exercise.


You can also leave some exercise gear, such as dumbbells or a balance ball, in a prominent place.
For example, you could put a pair of dumbbells by the sofa, and then when you sit down to watch TV you can prompt yourself to stand up and do some curls.Leaving your gear around will help you keep exercise in mind, and help you to come to identify yourself as an active person.

, Music can be a good motivating tool to get you moving and keep you moving. The type of music can be anything that inspires you or gives you a buzz and some energy. Listening to uplifting music before and during exercise can really help.Getting a portable music player can be a good way to keep you motivated if you’re out for a run or are working out in the gym.


Music can also help keep you focused and in the zone by blocking out distractions.
Choosing upbeat songs can give you subconscious encouragement to keep your pace up with the music.

, Gadgets that track your exercise habits and physical activity are becoming more and more popular. If you’re the sort of person who likes to monitor progress and be able to quantify what you are doing, a monitoring fitness gadget could be perfect for you. Something as simple as a pedometer can help you see how much or how little you walk in a day.


Research suggests that people who wore pedometers tended to walk a thousand steps a day more than when they weren’t wearing them.You can also get simple apps on your smartphone that will help you monitor yourself and keep track of how much exercise you get.

Don't stop eating suddenly for extended times.,
Don’t do any cleanse that involves swallowing oil.,
Avoid colon hydrotherapy/irrigation.,
Practice healthy cleansing habits.",How to Avoid the Dangers of Cleanses," For many people, this kind of abrupt change can be dangerous. Your blood sugar could get dangerously low for your brain and you could pass out, or you could experience electrolyte imbalances that can cause a heart arrhythmia.;
, These are often recommended for the ""cleansing"" of liver stones and gallstones, but what usually happens is that the oil is saponified (i.e., creates a type of soap) by bile in the gut and forms a reaction that looks like stones when you pass a bowel movement.However, the real danger here is that the sudden influx of oil while fasting can cause the gallbladder to spasm, which could eject stones into the biliary system and create a painful medical emergency.

, Your bowels do not need to be “washed” out unless you have a specific medical need to do so. The ecology of the intestines is delicate, and can be upset by forcing water through them at high pressure. Plus, this type of procedure puts one at risk for perforations and other unintended consequences., Now that you know what not to do, what can you do? At its core, doing a cleanse lessens the burden on your body so that it can better do its job to bind up, detoxify, and eliminate. Here are the most important points for doing a cleanse for your chosen period of time:


Avoid eating all junky foods. This includes foods with added sugars, fried foods, heavily processed foods that contain “non-food” ingredients, chemically processed foods.
Avoid eating lots of rich and meaty foods. These take more resources to process in your body. It is good to lighten the load occasionally.
Get plenty of rest and quality sleep at night. This is essential to body repairs and optimal function.
Avoid alcohol, and if you can handle it- all caffeine. Both of these things put a burden on your liver’s detoxification system, give it a break for a little while.
Eat small meals, avoid excess.
Drink plenty of filtered water to stay hydrated.
Eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and cabbage. These are particularly great at assisting the liver to do its work.
You may also try temporarily avoiding foods that many people can be sensitive to (not everyone)- especially dairy and gluten. Yes, there are herbs and nutrients that can help. Consult a licensed naturopathic doctor or master herbalist to help explain and guide you in their safe and proper use.
Practice dry skin brushing, which is a great way to stimulate good circulation of blood and lymph.

Chicken and sausages contain MSG products., Ranch dressing always has MSG, but most other salad dressings do, too. In addition to dressing, be wary of vegetable dips.Pay attention to soy sauce, Parmesan cheese, gravies, and dipping sauces., Bouillon and broths more than likely will have MSG in them. Even popular soup brands will place it into the cans."
"
Tell servers you want your food without MSG.,
Avoid certain foods when eating out.,
Watch out for fast food.",How to Avoid MSG3," These days, many restaurants have moved away from using MSG in their cooking. It is still a good idea to ask and to be adamant that MSG is not used in the food prepared for you.

, If you want to eat out but avoid MSG, known which foods to avoid. Common foods that contain MSG include vegetable broths, breads, dressings, soy products, sweeteners, and flavors., Most fast food restaurants, such as McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Chick-fil-A all put MSG in their food. If you are curious about which particular items have MSG, then go to the restaurant's website and look at the ingredients list."

Check menus before you choose restaurants.,
Ask questions and make requests when you order food.,
Moderate alcohol and choose low-calorie alcohol options.,
Pack healthy snacks for excursions.,
Enjoy smaller portions of special treats.,
Space your meals out over the day.",How to Avoid Weight Gain on Vacation1," Checking a restaurant’s menu before you go to the restaurant can help you to make a healthier choice. By looking at the menu ahead of time and deciding on a healthy option, you will be less tempted to go for something unhealthy when you get there.You can find most restaurants’ menus online and check out their healthy options before you go.
Try to avoid fast food restaurants. Instead choose local restaurants that serve locally-sourced meats and produce.
Try to avoid buffets or places that offer “all you can eat” options.;
, Some restaurants make it easier than others to order healthy meals, such as by listing calorie and fat counts right on the menu. If you are at a restaurant that does not display this info on the menu, then be prepared to ask questions about how the food is cooked and make special requests if necessary.Ask what type of oil and how much oil is used to cook foods. You can always request that your food be cooked without oil or with less oil if items are cooked with a lot of oil. Avoid the obvious deep fried foods. Look for foods that are sautéed, or baked or roasted.
Ask about dressing and other condiments that come with your meal and request that they be left on the side. For example, when ordering a salad, request the dressing on the side. This will make it easier for you to see how much dressing you are using. You can also ask for any ""light"" options for dressings.
Ask for a smaller portion. Portion sizes are often super-sized in restaurants, so you may want to ask if a smaller portion is available. If not, then consider splitting an entrée with someone or requesting a box to pack up half of your meal and take it with you.
Ask about substitutions and special orders. Some restaurants offer options to make their entrees healthier, such as egg whites in place of eggs. You might also be able to request an off-menu meal if there is nothing on the menu that looks healthy. For example, you might order a grilled skinless chicken breast with some steamed veggies.

, Many people like to enjoy cocktails and other alcoholic beverages on vacation, but the calories in these drinks can add up quickly. Drinking too much can also result in lowered inhibitions and you may end up eating more than you normally would. To prevent weight gain due to over-consuming alcohol, choose lower-calorie drink options and limit your intake.


Stick to wine spritzers, dry white or red wines, light beers, and cocktails made with low- or no-calorie mixers, such as a vodka with club soda and lime.
Don’t start drinking until after 5pm.Starting early in the day may end up ruining your eating and fitness goals for the day. Try having just one or two drinks with dinner or after dinner instead.

, While on vacation, you may want to go exploring somewhere with few healthy eating options. To prevent yourself from eating unhealthy foods on these excursions, make sure that you pack some healthy snacks.Try filling a cooler with baby carrots, hummus, and low-fat cheese sticks. Or bring some fruit that doesn't need to be kept cool, like apples and oranges.
Bring water and other calorie-free beverages to keep yourself hydrated.

, Since you are on vacation, you should allow yourself a treat each day. To avoid gaining weight from these indulgences, make sure that you limit your portions and only indulge in a treat once per day.For example, instead of having a giant ice cream sundae, just have a single scoop of ice cream.
If there is a treat that you want to try that only comes in a large portion, consider sharing it with a friend or family member.

, Don't skip meals and then go out to dinner ""starving."" You will overeat and your body will not have time to burn those calories before you go to bed. It's best to eat three meals a day, with some healthy snacks in between. You should be eating something about every two to three hours.

For instance, if you eat breakfast at 8am, have a snack at 11am, then eat lunch at 1pm. You can have another snack around 3 or 4pm, then eat dinner around 6 or 7pm.

Eat a well-rounded, nutritious snack.,
Opt for solid snacks instead of liquid.,
Substitute healthy alternatives.",How to Avoid Snacking," Symptoms of dehydration are easily mistaken for hunger. If you haven't been drinking enough water throughout the day, you might confuse your body's thirst signals as signs of hunger. If you know you had a sufficient meal an hour ago and your next meal isn't for a few hours, there's a good chance you're just thirsty.Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning.
Any time you feel yourself getting hungry, try drinking a glass of water before you reach for a snack. Then, if you're still hungry in a half hour or so, eat a small, healthy snack.;
, Some people feel compelled to snack because the basal ganglia in your brain urges you to put food in your mouth and chew. In this case it's more of a matter of habit and oral occupation than actual hunger.The best way to determine if you're experiencing this kind of fixation is to rule out other possibilities by drinking more water and checking if you still feel compelled to chew.


Instead of snacking, try chewing gum.
If you don't like gum, you can try chewing on ice chips. Just be careful not to damage your teeth by biting too hard on too much ice.
If you know you have an oral fixation, whether from previous smoking habits or your own observation, try satisfying your need to chew before you reach for a snack.

, If you're trying to break out of your compulsive snack habit, you may want to drink more coffee or tea between meals. Caffeine is a natural appetite suppressant which, in moderation (and without a lot of cream and sugar), can help control your cravings for snacks.Caffeine should always be consumed in moderation. Don't drink coffee all day, or you may end up feeling jittery and sick.
In order for coffee or tea to be helpful in curbing unhealthy eating habits, it's important to keep your caffeinated beverage plain. Adding cream or sugar will only tack on extra, empty calories.

, Watching television while you eat is a guaranteed way to end up indulging in mindless snacking. Studies show that despite your best efforts, you won't be able to pay much attention to what you're eating or how much you eat. This leads to both poor choices in food and overindulgence in snacking.Resist the urge to snack while you watch a movie or TV show.
Eat in the kitchen, instead of eating in front of your television set.
If you really must snack while you watch TV or a movie, use a pre-measured serving (make sure you use the portion size indicated on the label as your guide) and limit yourself to that serving.
Bringing a small handful of popcorn from the kitchen will make you less likely to overindulge than having a huge bowl or bag of snack food in front of the TV.

, If you're prone to compulsive snacking, you may need to distract yourself until you break the habit permanently. Any time you feel compelled to mindlessly snack, go for a walk, take a bike ride, or try picking up a hobby. Keeping your brain occupied will help you forget about your craving until it passes.Exercise is a great way to distract your brain while also improving brain function and releasing satisfying endorphins.If you're at work and can't squeeze in a full workout, try little mini routines like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or taking a walk around the building on your coffee break.
Engaging in a hobby like knitting or puzzle assembly when you're at home can help keep your hands and brain occupied while watching TV., Many experts agree that it's generally easier to avoid temptation than resist it. That means that when you're at the grocery store, it's easier to exercise the kind of willpower that leaves chips and cookies out of your shopping cart than it is to resist snacking on that junk food once it's in your home.Don't tempt yourself by looking at or smelling sweets, chips, and other forms of junk food.
Avoid walking down the snack food aisle altogether when you're at the grocery store.
Rid your fridge and cabinets of unhealthy snack foods. You can give them away to a friend who isn't trying to watch his weight, or simply throw them in the garbage.
Once junk food is out of your house, don't bring it back in. Avoiding unhealthy food is the best way to prevent yourself from giving in to temptation.

, Many people eat compulsively to soothe stressful situations. This sets up an unhealthy cycle of relying on food for comfort, and it can cause weight gain and other health problems.Remember that stress eating won't actually fix any of your problems. If anything, it creates new problems that you will have to face.
Causes of stress generally fall into one of four categories: general stress, life stress, work stress, and internal stress.Recognizing your source of stress and what category it falls under can help you identify stress eating habits.

, Many people fall into the trap of believing they deserve a ""treat"" for working out. This can effectively undo all the progress you've made with your exercise routine. Studies show that when people think of exercise as work, they're more likely to indulge in unhealthy snack habits. In contrast, those who saw exercise as an enjoyable routine were more likely to eat healthy and avoid unhealthy snacks.Try to think of exercise as a regular part of your day, instead of something unpleasant that you need to do.
Find ways to spruce up your workout routine. If you're not enjoying it on any level, try a different workout approach. Go for a bike ride instead of jogging, or take a long, scenic walk in a park or forest. Try a dance class, like Zumba.
Listen to music or podcasts while you work out. If you have a podcast you really like, keep it restricted to your workout time so you'll be motivated to work out longer and more often.

, Reducing your snack intake doesn't mean starving yourself. If anything, you should focus on eating nutritious, satisfying meals at breakfast, lunch, and dinner time so that you don't experience cravings between meals or before bed.


Make sure you're getting five to nine servings of fresh fruits and vegetables each day.Practice portion control. Using a smaller bowl/plate can trick your eyes and brain into thinking that you're eating more because your plate looks fuller. You'll still be just as full, and will avoid overeating.
Do not skip meals. Studies have shown that people who skip meals — especially breakfast — are more likely to snack later in the day, resulting in significant weight gain and a reduction in energy., Eating three square meals a day may not reduce your desire to snack as a coping mechanism, but it will help you feel fuller and healthier. Staying on a schedule can help condition your body to only eat at meal times, and to fill up on healthy, nutritious foods that sustain your energy levels throughout the day.Try to eat each meal at the same time everyday.
Bring healthy snacks like carrots, broccoli, and fresh fruit to work with you. That way you won't be tempted to hit the vending machine.
Pack a lunch to bring to work or school. That way you can control your portions, as well as what you're actually eating.

, Studies have shown that keeping a food journal can help you reduce mindless snacking and monitor your overall diet. By taking the time to inventory everything you eat, you force yourself to consciously think about the food choices you're making.Use a pocket-sized notebook, or download a smartphone app that will help you keep track of meals and snacks on the go.
Write down everything you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat it. You may also want to make note of whether you were actually hungry, or just stressed/tired/bored.
You can also write down in a separate column all the dates/times you felt like snacking but didn't.
Look for patterns in your snack cravings. If they tend to happen at the same time everyday, perhaps you need to adjust your meal times accordingly. If it happens at work or school (or shortly after), you may be stress eating without realizing it.

, A lot of mindless snacking ends up taking place when you eat fast or engage in other distracting activities (like watching television). Eating slowly without any distractions, and with adequate water to help satisfy your thirst, can help reduce your desire to snack later on.Practice eating at the table, even if it's just a snack.
Devote your full attention to eating. Savor the taste, and try to notice other sensory experiences like texture, smell, and appearance.
Don't rush through meals or snacks. If you eat slowly, you're more likely to recognize when your body is full, thus preventing overeating.

, If you must snack, it's a good idea to time your snacking so it will fill you up just enough until your next meal. Additionally, it's important to choose a snack that is healthy and will satisfy your hunger while giving you energy and nutrients.The ideal snacking time is approximately two to three hours before your next meal. That way the snack will power you along until meal time.
Keep snacks small and healthy. An appropriate portion for a snack is either a piece of fruit or four to six crackers. Keep your snacks between 150 and 300 calories.

, If you must indulge in a snack, it's important to choose foods that are low in calories, fat, and added sugar. By selecting foods from the USDA food guide, you'll be sure to get a more well-rounded and satisfying snack.Peanut butter and apple or banana slices makes an excellent snack.
Try dipping raw carrot sticks in a low-fat dressing.
Stir fresh fruit into a cup of fat-free yogurt for a refreshing, delicious treat.
Mix fruits and veggies together in a blender to make a delicious smoothie.
Whole-wheat crackers with hummus or bean dip are a healthy, satisfying snack.

, Eating a solid snack will help satisfy your hunger longer than liquid snacks, even if they have the same number of calories. That's because it takes your body a longer time to digest a solid than it does to digest a liquid, and a solid snack feels more like a meal to your brain., If you're used to a specific type of snack, finding a healthy alternative can help trick your brain into feeling equally satisfied without all the calories and guilt. Try finding foods that have similar textures or flavors to replace your unhealthy snack habits at home.Eat salted, unbuttered popcorn instead of potato chips.
Try freezing low-fat greek yogurt and eating that instead of ice cream.
If you're used to the crunchy sensation of certain snack foods, opt for fresh baby carrots instead.

Strengthen your eye lids.,
Perform focusing exercises.,
Do lateral and medial eye stretches.,
Do diagonal stretches.,
Draw an infinity sign with your eyes.,
Draw circles with your eyes.",How to Do Yoga Eye Exercises1," The muscles that surround your eyes can be strengthened just like the other muscles of the body. Begin by partially closing your eyes; the lids should only be halfway shut. You'll notice that your upper eyelids will tremble with the effort. Focus your efforts on stopping this trembling.Hint: Stopping the trembling of your eye lids will be easier if you focus your gaze on objects further away.
After holding for 10 to 15 seconds, close your eyes very slowly. Take a few deep breaths to increase oxygen in the blood. As you inhale through your nose, imagine the fresh, oxygen-rich air coming through your nose and into the eyes. Then, exhale out through your mouth. Continue this breathing exercise for one to minutes.;
, By focusing on objects at different distances, you exercise your eyes in focusing at distances both far away and near as well as provide relief from eyestrain. There are two types of focusing exercises you can try:


Hold a pen at arm's length. Focus your gaze on the tip of the pen. Bring the pen closer to your nose at a slow and steady pace. Repeat this exercise 5-10 times.Concentrate your vision on the tip of your nose. Then shift your gaze to an object further away, either at arm's length or 20 feet away. Then shift your eyes back to the tip of your nose. Repeat this exercise 10 times.
Be inventive and challenge yourself. Choose objects at several different distances to focus your eyes on.

, These exercises stretch and strengthen specific eye muscles, those that move the eye from side to side. For instance, when looking to your right, you are using the lateral rectus of your right eye as well as the medial rectus of your left eye. When you look to your left, you use the lateral rectus of your left eye and medial rectus of your right eye.Sit in a relaxed but upright position. Begin by look to the left-most position (without moving your head) and hold to stretch your eye muscles. Hold for 5 counts. Blink and return your gaze back to look straight in front of you. Then look to the right-most position with your gaze and hold for 5 counts. Repeat 3 times, blinking between each hold. Make sure to move your eyes either during inhalation or exhalation; try not to hold your breath.
Then, repeat this exercise looking up and then down. Do not forget about blinking.

, As in the previous exercise, diagonal stretches require looking in a fixed position for a few seconds. There are additional muscles worked here, however. For instance, when looking up towards your left, you are using the superior oblique of your left eye and the inferior oblique of the right eye.Sit in a relaxed but upright position. Look up and to your right for 5 seconds. Return your gaze to center. Look up to and to your left for 5 seconds. Return your gaze to center. Look down and to your right for 5 seconds. Return your gaze to center. Look down and to your left for 5 seconds. Repeat 3 times.

, Imagine an infinity sign or horizontal figure eight in front of you. Trace the eight with only your eyes slowly, and about ten times, without moving your head. Blink between repetitions.

, One helpful way to do this is to imagine that you are looking at the number 12 on a clock. Then, follow the numbers around the clock with your eyes. Repeat going the other way around the clock.

Use regular eye drops like Visine or Clear Eyes.,
Try thicker viscosity eye drops.,
Try blue eye drops.",How to Get Bright White Eyes1," These eye drops are used to reduce redness in your eyes and give them a bit of moisture to counteract irritants or otherwise dryness in the eyes. Visine, Clear Eyes, and other brands can be purchased at grocery and drug stores, as well as larger stores like Target, Walmart, and so on. Put 1-2 drops in the affected eye. Consult the instructions on the bottle for additional information.


Don't use eyedrops like Visine or Clear Eyes too often. While they give good immediate results, when used regularly, they actually prevent your eyes from creating their own natural lubrication, and your eyes may become chronically dry, red, and dependent on the drops. A safer option is saline drops or gentle eyedrops like Systane that mimic natural tears.;
, A Japanese brand of eye drops called Rohto is a product that is thicker than natural tears. They have cooling properties that relieve burning eyes and they reduce redness as well. These are available at grocery and drug stores. If you have not used any eye drops before, these might not be the best ones to start with, as they can feel a little harsh to the eye., A company from Switzerland, Innoxa, makes eye drops that are actually colored blue. In addition to relieving burning and redness symptoms, Innoxa Blue Drops also coat your eyes with a light film of blue, which counteracts the yellowish tinge in your eyeballs to make them appear whiter."

Choose hotels that have fitness centers.,
Find a race.,
Go on a biking or walking tour.,
Try out some water sports.",How to Avoid Weight Gain on Vacation2," Choosing a hotel with a fitness center can make it much easier to get your exercise in. When you are booking your hotel, check to see if the hotel has a fitness center and/or pool.Try to work out first thing in the morning and then you won’t have to worry about it for the rest of the day. Go run on the treadmill, use the elliptical machine, or swim in the pool.
If your hotel does not have a fitness center, then you can always do a workout in your hotel room. There are lots of gym-free exercises that you can do to stay in shape on your vacation, such as jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, burpees, and leg lifts.
You can also put on your walking/running shoes and go outside and walk or jog in one direction for 15 minutes, and then turn around and walk or jog back.

, Doing a 5k or a bike race while you are on vacation can also help to keep you in a fit state of mind and ensure that you get some good exercise on at least one day.If you are not into running or biking, then look for a 5K that permits walkers as well.


You can find races all over the world to participate in. Check for a race in your vacation location and register ahead of time.
Many races also give you a t-shirt along with your registration fee, so you will have a cool souvenir to bring home.

, You might want to see the sights while you are on vacation, but taking a bus tour will not burn any calories. Instead, consider going on a biking or walking tour. This will help to ensure that you get plenty of exercise and enjoy what your vacation site has to offer.


You can often find niche tours in big cities, such a haunted history tours, architecture tours, and shopping tours. Look for a tour that will be interesting to you and you will have more motivation to keep walking or biking along.

, Many people like to spend time in a swimsuit while on vacation. If this is something you enjoy, then checking out a water sport might be a great way to burn some extra calories and have fun too. Some water sports you might enjoy include:


Swimming
Surfing
Water skiing
Paddle-boarding
Kayaking

Keep a food diary.,
Wear a fitness monitor.,
Weigh yourself twice per week.,
Pay attention to how your clothes are fitting.",How to Avoid Weight Gain on Vacation3," Keeping track of everything that you eat and drink will help you to see if you are eating just enough or too much while you are on your vacation.You can keep a pen and paper record of what you eat or use an app to keep track of what you eat.


Make sure that you record everything or you will not have an accurate record.
Some apps even allow you to take a quick picture of your plate with your smartphone, then upload it to the app.

, Fitness monitors can offer some great motivation to exercise more, eat less, and sleep better while you are on vacation.Try wearing a fitness monitor every day during your vacation to keep yourself on track.


Try setting a vacation step goal for yourself that is a little higher than your usual to help offset any extra calories you take in. For example, if your usual step goal is 10,000 steps, then try setting a vacation step goal of 12,000 steps.

, Weighing yourself is a great way to keep yourself in check with your diet and exercise goals; however, it is not a good idea to weigh yourself every day because weight fluctuates from day to day. Instead, weigh yourself twice per week to determine if you are gaining weight or not.If there is a fitness center in your hotel, then there should be a scale. If not, ask at the front desk if there is a scale you can use. You can also bring a scale along with you. If you decide to bring a scale, make sure that it is a lightweight scale that you can easily fit in your suitcase.
To get the most accurate reading, weigh yourself first thing in the morning before you eat or drink anything.
Wear only your underwear or light weight clothing when you weigh yourself (or you can just do it naked). Do not wear shoes. Shoes and clothes can add up to five pounds onto your weight.
If the scale shows a higher number on one day, don’t panic. Just try to get a little more exercise and cut down on your calories for the next few days.

, If you don’t have access to a scale while you are on vacation, then you can also use the fit of your clothes to help you determine if you have gained any weight.


Try bringing a pair of jeans that fit you well and try them on once every couple of days. If your jeans feel snug one day, then get a little more exercise and cut back on your calories for a few days.

Massage your eyes.,
Blink more.,
Take breaks.,
Perform palming to relax your eyes.",How to Do Yoga Eye Exercises2," Massage is a common treatment to relieve tension or stress because it helps stimulate increased blood flow to targeted areas. Begin by gently massaging your upper eyelids for 10 seconds. Then, gently massage your lower eyelids.


If you wear contact lenses, take them out before doing this exercise.
Apply light pressure when massaging and use the first three fingers of your hand.Make gentle, circular movements.
The soft pressure on the lacrimal glands, which produce most of your tears, helps to stimulate tear production and wetness in the eyes. This, in turn, provides soothing and much-needed hydration to tired eyes.
When massaging the lower lids, make sure to massage across the lacrimal bone, which is located near the inner eye., Blinking offers much-needed breaks and moments of relaxation for our eyes. However, it is often something most people disregard since it is such a natural activity that generally requires little thought. However, making an effort to blink more frequently can help ameliorate eye strain.


Blinking helps lubricate and hydrate your eyes. Not only does blinking push out toxins with tears, it also works to spread tear film evenly over your eyes.Blinking can thus help ameliorate eye dryness.Try to blink once every four seconds to keep your eyes from drying out.

, Giving your eyes more breaks during periods of intense focus or concentration, particularly at a computer screen, will help alleviate eye strain.


Try the 20-20-20 method: Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen at any object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.If you have a hard time remembering to take breaks, set an alarm as a reminder to rest and reset your eyes.
You can also try fully opening and closing your eyes every once in a while. Research suggests that this action can reduce the symptoms of eye strain, eye fatigue, and dry eyes., Palming can be done very simply. Take your palms and cover your eyes for a few minutes.


Sit comfortably in a chair with a straight back. Place your elbows on a table, on top of a pillow or blanket for added comfort. Rub your palms together beforehand to produce some heat before you begin palming - this heightens the relaxation component of this technique. Cup each hand and close your eyes. Place each cupped hand over each eye. Breathe normally and rest in this position for 5-10 minutes. You may want to set an alarm to keep the time.If after your alarm goes off you feel refreshed, then this the right amount of time you should spend palming. If you don't feel refreshed, add an extra five minutes and observe any changes afterwards."

Also, the blue tones will help to counteract yellowish colors that might show up in the whites of your eyes, which will make your eyes appear brighter and clearer., These days white eyeliner could be easily found in market. Just a swipe or two of white eyeliner on your eyelid will not only make them brighter will also make them wider. You can also take little white eyeliner near corner of your lids and blend it, this will give an angel like look. Your face will look dewy and very fresh., Making your eyes stand out can help them appear whiter. Using black mascara on both top and bottom lashes will make dramatic eyes, but they do not help your eyes look whiter. Instead, try brown mascara on your bottom lashes. This softer color will help draw the attention upwards to your top lashes, which will make your eyes appear wider, more alert and whiter., By using a light bone-colored or flesh-colored eyeliner, your eyes will attract and reflect light, which will help make it seem like your eyes are larger. Outline the inner corners of your eyes with the eyeliner to give the illusion of being brighter.Apply a shimmering white or light-colored eye shadow in the inner corners of your eyes to attain a similar effect.Try to refrain from using a white eyeliner pencil to outline your eye, as this can be hard to blend in properly and may look too ""staged"" or artificial., An eyelash curler, which is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores for about $5 to $6, will clamp your eyelashes and bend them upwards in a curl. Curling your lashes upward will make your eyes appear to be bigger and more open. They can also draw attention to your eyes by making your eyelashes appear longer., Apply pink blush to the apples of your cheeks, your lips, and across the highest point of your eyebrows. This will lighten and brighten your entire face, which will help make your eyes appear brighter and whiter."

Get eye exams and ask about the available solutions, and consider the traditional options: glasses, contacts, LASIK (which may improve near vision in one eye, called monovision) and finally, the use of intraocular lenses (IOLs) .,
Find what doctors suggest to do about the newer procedures that are coming, and you can be planning.,
Check with your vision insurance company and read your policy to see what will be paid and which treatments and how much costs will or will not (or may not) be paid by your vision care insurance, under what conditions.,
Find out about the implant of the new Flexivue corneal lens: Using a laser, a tiny pocket is made in the cornea, and a Flexivue brand ""microlens"" is implanted there.,
Check into corneal inlay, ""pinhole"" optics procedure, called Acuvue: A flap is cut in the cornea, as during a LASIK procedure.,
Learn about corneal shaping called the ""Intracor"" procedure: Laser energy is pulsed just under the surface of the cornea creating small interior incisions that may be included to correct small degrees of either nearsightedness or farsightedness.",How to Get Better Close Focus of Your Eyes," Consider those or wait for the new procedures to complete research phases and become commercially, publicly available in the U.S.; you still have those ready options for treating presbyopia.;
, You can discuss your options with your eye doctor to get help deciding to make your choice for your needs.

,


Surgery deemed cosmetic is not paid for by insurance unless there is an injury needing repair, in the opinion of the insurance providers.

, The pocket then heals, self-seals, holding the lens in that place. The procedure takes about 10 minutes once you and everything else is ready.


""This corneal lens implant appears to be a safe, effective way to correct presbyopia in people aged 45 to 60,"" said Dr. Pallikaris, MD, University Hospital of Crete, Greece. ""Ninety-eight percent of patients were satisfied with their vision; 69 percent reported 'excellent' and 30 percent 'good' near vision in our survey. Ninety-two percent said they no longer used glasses."" He said there were no surgery-related complications, but about 15 percent of patients reported glare and/or halos around lights, and some had reduced contrast sensitivity.

In studies on Flexivue near vision was improved from 20/100 to 20/25 (average) in the one eye with the implant without glasses, and vision was stable in both eyes in study follow-ups.



, Then an inlay (not a lens) with a small, pinhole opening is placed in the center of the cornea, and the flap is replaced, but patients may notice a slight difference when they compare their two eyes.


Inlays, as with corneal lenses, are reversible by removal, according to Daniel S. Durrie, MD, a clinical investigator employed by AcuFocus.
The inlays' pinhole changes depth of focus. The inlay blocks out peripheral (surrounding) light without affecting the central vision which uses the rays passing through the pinhole, improving near vision and leaving distance vision as before in the eye with the implant.

,


The pulses mainly help to shift the center of the cornea forward, improving near vision without affecting distant vision. Unlike LASIK and related surgeries, no tissue is removed. The study advocates say that there is little risk of infection and the cornea is not weakened, according to Mike P. Holzer, MD, University of Heidelberg, Germany, who receives consulting fees from Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH.

In research, patients' vision improved within hours of treatment and remained stable during follow-up.

Identify foods that trigger your indigestion.,
Lower your alcohol intake to avoid indigestion.,
Eat dinner early to curb indigestion at night.,
Eat small meals throughout the day to reduce your indigestion.,
Chew thoroughly to discourage indigestion.,
Manage your weight to help manage indigestion.,
Reduce stress to discourage indigestion.,
Discuss your medications with your doctor that may cause indigestion.,

Ask your doctor about stronger medications for severe indigestion.,
Control indigestion during pregnancy with home remedies.",How to Avoid Indigestion," If a food gives you indigestion, it will usually do so within about three hours. Even if you have never been sensitive to a food in the past, people can develop intolerances and sensitivities throughout their lives. One way to identify which foods may be causing your symptoms is to make a list of suspected foods or foods that commonly trigger indigestion, then eliminate them from your diet for two weeks, and notice if your indigestion stops. Then reintroduce the foods, one by one, and record if you begin experiencing symptoms again. If so, then you know you need to avoid that food. Common foods that trigger indigestion include:Caffeine. Though that morning coffee or tea may be crucial for getting out of bed in the morning, it may be causing your indigestion, too.
Spicy foods. Some people find that food with chili triggers their indigestion. The amount that people can tolerate is highly variable.
Fatty, heavy foods. This includes breaded, deep fried foods and foods cooked in a lot of oil. Many fast foods, such as fries, potato chips, and fried dough are deep fried.
Carbonated drinks. Fizzy drinks like sodas taste great, but they are frequent triggers for indigestion.
Chocolate. Chocolate can also trigger indigestion.;
, Alcohol can make your body produce more stomach acid. With more acid, you are at a higher risk of the acid irritating the tissues of your digestive tract.Do not mix alcohol with painkillers, even over-the-counter painkillers like aspirin. Doing so can increase the damage to the lining of your stomach.

, Time your last meal so that your body has plenty of time to digest it before you go to sleep. Try to finish eating at least three hours before you go to bed.This is important because when you lie down, it is easier for stomach acid to flow up into your esophagus.
If you are prone to heartburn when you go to bed, don’t lie completely flat. Prop yourself up slightly by putting pillows under your head and shoulders. This will allow you to use gravity to help keep the acid down.

, If you eat more frequently, you will be less hungry when you do eat. This will make you less likely to overeat. It will prevent you from overburdening your stomach with more food than it can handle.Overeating can stretch your stomach and be painful.
Instead of eating two or three huge meals, try eating five or six smaller ones. Add mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks to your meal plan.

, Chewing breaks your food down into smaller pieces. In turn, that helps make it easier for your stomach to digest. The easier your stomach digests food, the less likely you are get indigestion.


Reduce the stress on your digestive system by eating slowly. This means that your digestive tract has less food to deal with at any given time.
If you usually eat your food in five to 10 minutes, consider pausing as you eat and stretching it out to 30 or 45 minutes.
In addition, eating slowly will allow your full stomach to communicate to your brain that you are full and you should stop eating, even if there is still food on the plate. Eating too fast doesn't allow this communication to naturally occur and you have already over eaten by the time your brain tells you that you are full.

, Carrying extra pounds puts pressure on your stomach, making you vulnerable to indigestion. The best way to control your weight is to eat healthy and exercise.A healthy balanced diet includes fresh fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy, whole grain breads and pastas, and, if you eat meat, lean meats. Foods to limit are fatty or sugary foods like red meat, fried foods, pastries, candies, cookies, and cakes.
Women who want to diet safely should aim for 1,200 – 1,500 calories per day. Men should eat 1,500 – 1,800 calories per day. These diets should enable you to lose a pound per week. If you plan to do more severe dieting, you should be supervised by a doctor to make sure that it is safe for you.
Regular exercise will help you trim down and burn calories. For best results, do 15 to 30 minutes a day at least five times per week. Make it fun by choosing an activity you enjoy like sports, running, walking, or biking.

, Stress triggers indigestion for many people. Luckily, there are many ways you can learn to control your reaction to stress and to relax. They may take some practice, but it is worth the effort. Relaxation techniques to try include:Deep Breathing
Meditation
Yoga
Tai Chi

, Some medications may make you vulnerable to indigestion. Do not stop taking your medications or change how you take them without talking to your doctor first. Your doctor will work with you to find a suitable alternative.Nitrates, which are given to widen blood vessels, may weaken the muscle at the bottom of your esophagus. This makes you more vulnerable to acid reflux.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen may make indigestion worse.
Some diabetes medicines (metformin) and antibiotics can also cause some stomach upset.
If you are unable to change medications, your doctor may advise you to take them with a meal.

, A muscle at the bottom of your esophagus connects your esophagus to your stomach. That muscle prevents the acid from leaving your stomach and entering your esophagus. Smoking damages it and makes you vulnerable to acid reflux.The chemicals in cigarettes can also give you indigestion. You have many resources available to help you stop smoking. You can:Join a support group or call a hotline when you have a craving
Talk to your doctor or an addictions counselor
Try nicotine replacement therapy
Try residential treatment where you will have 24 hour access to medical and emotional support through doctors, counselors, and peers

, These over-the-counter medications neutralize excess stomach acid. This makes the acid less irritating to the lining of your stomach, esophagus, and intestines.


If you always get indigestion at the same time of day, like when you go to bed, take one at that time. If your digestion is unpredictable, you can take one whenever you feel the indigestion starting. The relief will probably last 20 minutes to a couple hours.
Antacids are widely available at local pharmacies and supermarkets. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child.

, This medication produces a foam in your stomach which blocks your stomach acid from flowing into your esophagus. You take one after you eat to prevent indigestion from happening.Alginates should be taken after you eat because that maximizes their effects. They stay in your stomach longer and are present when you have the most stomach acid.
Many antacids also contain an alginate. The information on the packaging will tell you if that is the case.

, These techniques have not been scientifically proven, but some people find them to be helpful. Talk to your doctor before taking any herbal remedies or dietary supplements to be sure that they are safe for you. Some may interact with medications or make certain GI conditions worse.Try probiotics containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. This ""good"" bacteria may help maintain the balance of good and harmful bacteria in your digestive system.Eat oatmeal to absorb excess acid. You can even try eating a spoonful of dry oatmeal.
Soothe nausea by drinking peppermint tea (do not use peppermint if you have indigestion due to GERD, as this can actually make it worse).Use ginger. Ginger can settle your stomach and reduce nausea. You can use it to make a tea, eat candied ginger, or drink ginger ale.
Take artichoke leaf extract. This substance may increase bile.
Try STW5. This supplement contains peppermint, bitter candytuft, licorice, and caraway. It is said to reduce the amount of acid your body makes.
Drink cranberry juice or take cranberry supplements to inhibit the growth of H. pylori bacteria., Your doctor may recommend either over-the-counter medications or prescription strength medications. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects before you start, especially if you are pregnant or nursing. Your doctor may suggest:Antibiotics. This may be necessary if the indigestion is caused by an infection of H. pylori bacteria.
Proton pump inhibitors. These medications lower acid production. They are known to interact with medications for epilepsy and blood thinners. Side effects may include rashes, abdominal pain, dizziness, headaches, constipation, diarrhea, gas, nausea, or vomiting.
H2-receptor antagonists. These medications reduce the acidity of your stomach acid. They are generally only given after antacids, alginates, and proton pump inhibitors were ineffective.
Anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications. This may reduce the discomfort caused by the indigestion.

, Pregnant women are vulnerable to getting indigestion because of the hormonal changes their bodies are going through, the expanding uterus pressing on the stomach, and the relaxation of the muscle separating the esophagus and the stomach. Home remedies to try include:Eating a spoonful of dry oatmeal before bed.
Maintaining good posture when eating so that your torso is straight. Good posture will minimize the pressure on your stomach.
Eating five or six small meals each day, rather than three large ones, which reduces the amount of stomach acid your body must produce to digest a meal.
Avoiding processed foods and focusing instead on whole foods.
Taking probiotics with your doctor's approval.
Waiting three hours or longer before laying down for bed after eating. If you do go to bed earlier than that, try propping yourself up on pillows so your head is above your stomach.
If you are pregnant and experiencing indigestion, talk to your doctor before you take any medications, even over-the-counter medications.

Decide what kind of doctor you need.,
Find an eye doctor.,
Make an appointment.,
Prepare for the doctor’s questions.,
Bring a valid ID and your insurance information.,
Bring your glasses or contacts.,
Check your visual acuity.,
Get a refraction assessment.,
Test your eye muscles.,
Check your visual field.,
Test your color vision.,
Use a slit lamp.,
Get a retinal examination.,
Ask any questions you have.,
Discuss your visual aids.,
Make your next appointment.",How to Do an Eye Exam," There are three kinds of eye specialists who can perform an eye exam. They have different specialties, and the kind you look for will depend on what kind of problem you have and your personal preference.Ophthalmologists. These are medical doctors who can provide the full range of eye care. They give eye exams and prescribe corrective lenses. They can also diagnose and treat eye diseases, and perform eye surgery.
Optometrists. These can provide many of the same services as ophthalmologists, including exams, prescriptions, and even treating certain diseases. If you have a more serious problem, or require surgery, they will probably refer you to an ophthalmologist.
Opticians. These are focused on filling prescriptions for eyeglasses and occasionally contact lenses. They will provide basic eye exams for the purpose of figuring out your needs, but won’t be able to give medical treatment.;
, Your eye doctor is going to be different than your regular doctor, and you may not immediately know of one. If you want to get your eyes checked, there are several good sources for finding an eye doctor to call.Get a referral from someone you trust. This can be friends or family who have gone to an eye doctor that they like, or you can ask your personal doctor.
If you are near a hospital or university medical center, call the department of ophthalmology or optometry to get information. You can also look for state and county academies, associations, or societies of optometrists and ophthalmologists for more help.
Ask your insurance company, especially if there are any covered under your plan. Your options may be more limited here, but you will likely find one that your plan pays for, which can reduce the cost of your visit.

, In most cases, you can’t just show up to an eye doctor and expect to get an exam. Once you have a doctor to visit, give the office a call so you can set up an appointment. When you call the office to set up an appointment, the receptionist will ask why you are visiting. You can give any answer you want, even saying you just want a check-up, as long as the doctor knows what to expect when you arrive.Some specific problems you might have that an eye doctor should look at include red or painful eyes, foreign bodies in your eyes, reduced vision, double vision, or headaches.Your answer here will help the doctor prepare for your visit. If you are having problems, this is the time to explain them, so the doctor will know what to look for when you arrive.
Once you set up an appointment, it is important that you arrive on time. Eye doctors are busy, and if you are late they will probably take someone else, meaning you’ll have to wait, or even reschedule for another time. Your best bet is arrive a few minutes before your appointment, so you are ready and waiting when the doctor calls you in.

, When you are at the doctor’s office, there are certain questions he will be sure to ask. It can be helpful, and make your appointment go more quickly, to make sure you know the answers to these questions before you go. Topics you will discuss include:Eye problems you are currently having. You’ll talk about any pain or discomfort you feel, maybe under different lighting conditions, if your vision gets blurry at certain distances, or if you are having problems with your side vision.
Your history of eye problems. Certainly you’ll talk about wearing glasses or contacts. The doctor will make sure you are wearing them regularly, especially if you need them, and if you are happy with them. You will also want to talk about if you have had other eye problems in the past.
Family history of eye problems. Your doctor will want to know if someone in your family has had eye issues, including cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degeneration.
Other parts of your health history. This can include being born prematurely, recent health problems such as high blood pressure or heart disease, diabetes, or if you are overweight. Your doctor will also ask similar questions about your family’s medical history.
Medication history, including if you are currently taking anything or if you have any particular allergies to food or drugs.

, Like any other doctor’s appointment, you will need to fill out paperwork and be prepared to provide personal information. If you have health insurance, make sure you bring your card or other form of identification so that the office knows how to arrange payment., If you wear visual aids, like glasses or contacts, make sure you bring them with you to the exam. Your doctor will want to see your prescription and the condition of your glasses. Even if you don’t need a new prescription, you may want replacement lenses or frames.If you wear sunglasses, it can be good to bring those too. It can be helpful for the doctor to see the prescription and keep them in good shape. Plus, if your eyes are dilated, they will be more sensitive to light, so you might want them on the ride home., This is a common test to see how clearly can see. The doctor will have you look at a chart with letters written on it. As you look down the chart, the letters will get smaller and harder to read. This is called a Snellen chart, and will give a good sense of how clearly you can see from a distance.Visual acuity is measured from 20 feet away. When you get a measurement on your eyesight, it will include “20” over another number, explaining your vision. For example, 20/100 means that you can see at 20 feet what a normal person can see at 100 feet.
Your doctor may also test your close range acuity with a card that you hold in front of you like a book or newspaper. This card will usually be about 14 inches away from your face.

, In this test, your doctor is looking to see that light refracts (bends) properly to the back of your eye. If the light doesn’t bend properly, that’s when you need some form of correction, usually glasses or contacts.The first part of the assessment may involve shining a light into your eye and measuring the light’s movement as it gets reflected back through your pupil. Your doctor might even have a computerized reader for this. This is meant to give an estimate of your refraction.
The next step involves fine-tuning this estimate, probably using a phoropter, a mask-like device that the doctor will put in front of your face. The doctor will adjust a series of lenses, and ask you to judge which ones help you see better., One of the things the doctor will want to check is that your muscles can control your eyes. He will ask you to follow a small object with your eyes, usually a pen or small light, to see how well your eyes move. He will be looking for muscle weakness, poor control, or poor coordination., This will examine your peripheral vision, that is your ability to see side-to-side without moving your eyes or head. The test will try to determine how well you can see your surroundings, and if you have trouble viewing any particular area. There are several different ways to test your field of vision.Confrontation exam. Here, your doctor will sit in front of you and have you cover one eye. He will ask you to stare straight ahead while he moves his hands around your face. You will then tell him when you are able to see his hand.
Tangent screen exam. In this test, you will stare at a target on a screen. Other objects will appear on the screen while you stare straight ahead, and you will tell the doctor when you see them and when they disappear.
Automated perimetry. This test involves you watching a screen with blinking lights. You will tell your doctor every time you see one. This test usually involves you staring at an enclosed screen, and pressing a button to signal that you see something.

, If you are having trouble telling the difference between certain colors, your doctor may test to see if you are color blind. This test will involve a pattern of colored dots. There will be shapes and letters in different colors in the patterns. If you have trouble seeing colors, it will be difficult or impossible to see the shapes., A slit lamp is a microscope that uses an intense line of light to illuminate the front of your eye. The doctor will use this light to examine the different parts of your eye, including the lids, cornea, iris, and lens to make sure everything looks healthy.In some cases, the doctor may use dye to help color the film of tears over your eye. This dye is perfectly safe, and will wash away quickly after the doctor is done. The dye can help color in damaged cells in your eye, making them easier for the doctor to see.

, This is sometimes called an ophthalmoscopy or funduscopy, and will allow the doctor to see the back of your eye. It is done with an ophthalmoscope, which is basically a small handheld device that the doctor will use to shine a light into your eye.To do this properly, he will need to give you drops that dilate your pupils, making them bigger. Once he has given you the drops, there are several different ways the doctor may examine your eyes.Direct exam. Here, the doctor will use an ophthalmoscope to shine a beam of light directly into your eye.
Indirect exam. In this test the doctor will have a bright light mounted on his forehead, and reflect it towards your eye using a conditioning lens that he holds near your eye. You may be lying down or reclining for this test.
If your pupils are dilated they will be more sensitive to light. This means you may want to bring sunglasses to help you get home, or even go with a friend so you don’t have to drive., Your doctor has probably asked you plenty of questions during the exam, and now it’s your turn. If you are unsure about anything he said, or suggestions he is making, go ahead and ask. Both of you want your eyes to be as healthy as possible, so if you need the doctor to clarify something, just ask.If you come up with questions after the exam, don’t be afraid to call the office afterward.

, After giving you the exam, your doctor may decide that you need visual aids like glasses or contacts, or stronger prescriptions for the ones you already wear. Make sure you are comfortable with what you want to do, and talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of each. Whatever you purchase, make sure you also have the materials necessary to keep them clean.Picking glasses. When picking your glasses, the lenses are taken care of by your doctor’s prescription, but you will have many options when it comes to choosing your frames. Consider the size, shape, and material of your frames. You want glasses that fit your face, match your skin tone and hair color, and won’t give your skin an allergic reaction. Glasses can be a stylish choice when they accentuate the positive features of your face, so consider options that fit your taste and style.

Picking contact lenses. Unlike glasses, contacts are not necessarily visible, so your choices are much more about personal comfort. Think about soft or rigid lenses, as well as how often you intend to wear them. Your eye care provider will most likely fit you with the best lenses for your eyes.
Make sure you look at the cost for different designs as well, including what costs are covered by your insurance company.
It is probably best to buy your glasses or contacts from the same place that you got your exam. This will make it easier to sort out problems.

, Once you have gone through the exam, you can set up your next one. When that happens will depend on what the doctor saw during your visit. If there is a problem, you may need a visit soon for him to check on how you are doing. If there is no problem, you may not need one for another year or so.When you schedule your next visit in advance, the office will be able to give a call to remind you when the appointment is close. This can be a helpful reminder if you aren’t going for at least six months.

Look for the physical symptoms.,
Keep an eye out for behavioral changes.,
Think about your cat's recent activities.,
Investigate possible underlying health problems.,
Get veterinary attention as soon as possible.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian.,
Give your veterinarian a thorough health history of your cat.,
Discuss possible alternative causes for the cat's eye issues.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Feline Retinal Disease," Retinal disease can cause a number of symptoms in cats. Some signs creep up slowly, such as a gradual loss of vision, while some appear abruptly, like bleeding from trauma. Look for the following signs in the eye:


Cloudiness in the eye
Bleeding in the eye
Dilation of blood vessel in the retina
Grey “spots” in the eye
Blindness or loss of some vision;
, As retinal disease progresses, the cat will lose its vision. This will cause a variety of changes in your cat's behavior. A cat which is losing vision may become less playful or active, be prone to accidents and falls when navigating jumps or leaps, spend more time sleeping, meow more than normal, or seek out its human more than normal.


Perhaps your cat is getting clumsy or running into objects. It may also be more sedentary, as the unknown can cause it to stick to very familiar areas.

, Retinal detachment happens when the retina separates from the eyeball’s innermost lining.There are numerous causes of retinal detachment in the cat but acute trauma is one of them. Think back about possible incidents that could have caused trauma to the cat's eyeball. This is important information to relay to the cat's veterinarian.

, Retinal separation can be caused by genetic malformation, as well as by acute health problems, such as kidney disease, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure. If you know your cat has one of these problems, then eye problems could be a side effect of the condition.For example, a genetic condition called retinal atrophy can be a cause of retinal detachment. One key symptom of retinal atrophy is that the cat has night blindness before it becomes totally blind., Whenever you suspect an eye problem in your cat, have it examined immediately. Eye problems can quickly lead to costly treatment or loss of vision.


You may not be able to come up with a specific diagnosis yourself, but your instincts about there being a problem with your cat's eyes could save its vision.

, To diagnose retinal detachment the veterinarian looks into the eye with an ophthalmoscope and takes into consideration observed signs of blindness, diminished vision, and/or a dilated iris.There are various tests and exams a veterinarian may perform to diagnose retinal disease in cats in addition to direct visual examination. These include:Testing for menace response to see if the cat responses to “threats” to the eye.
Testing pupillary reflex to see if pupils dilate and constrict normally.
A Schirmer tear test to measure tear production.
Fluorescent staining to check for eye damage.
Measuring the pressure in the eyeball with a tonometer.

, This will help the vet figure out possible causes of the damage. There are numerous diseases or conditions that can cause retinal disease in the cat. Among these are:Inherited diseases: There are inherited diseases which can cause retinal disease. Examples include progressive retinal atrophy (especially in the Abyssinian breed) and retinal dysplasia (usually in Bengal and Persian cats).Developmental diseases: Viral diseases, such as panleukopenia, received while a mother cat is pregnant, can cause eye development problems in the developing fetus.High blood pressure: In cats this is generally due to kidney disease, but can be a primary symptom.Nutritional deficiencies: Taurine, an essential amino acid, needs to be supplied in a cat’s diet or the cat from suffer from health problems, including blindness due to the retina’s need for this nutrient., Eye problems are not always cause by retinal disease. There are other conditions can cause bleeding in the eye with the potential for a loss of vision. These will have different treatment methods but are also quite serious so your veterinarian will want to rule them out. They include:Trauma
Metabolic disease
Systemic infections
Tumors
Blood abnormalities like anemia or blood clotting disorders

, The veterinarian will take all findings, the physical exam, medical history and nutritional intake, into consideration before making a diagnosis of retinal detachment. Regardless of the cause of retinal disease, they all lead to poor vision or blindness in the affected cat if treatment is not given in a timely manner.


There are some surgery options but they are invasive, expensive, and few specialists perform them.Thus, the best course of action is usually to treat the underlying cause of the retinal disease. If all else fails, it's also important to give your cat palliative treatment for the progressing illness.
In many advanced cases, treatment cannot help vision loss or blindness.

Try a simple pointing test.,
Conduct the Distance-Hole-In-The-Card test.,
Do the Near-Hole-In-The-Card test.,
Do the convergence test.",How to Determine Your Dominant Eye1," With both eyes open, point your finger at a distant object. Close one eye, then switch and close the other eye. Your finger should appear to move off or away from the object when one eye is closed. If the finger does not appear to move, then the eye you closed is your nondominant eye.Another variation of this test is to stretch your arms out in front of you and form a triangular-shaped hole with your fingers. Look through this hole at an object about 10 feet (3 m) away, keeping both eyes open. Without moving, close one eye, then the other. The object should appear to move, possibly out of the triangular window, when you close one of your eyes. If it moves, then you are looking through your nondominant eye.;
, This test examines which eye you use to focus on objects that are 10 feet away. You can easily perform it on yourself at home.Cut a hole in a piece of paper that is about an inch and a half in diameter. On a second piece of paper write a single letter so that it is roughly one inch high.
Tape or tack the paper with the letter onto a wall at eye level. Measure a distance of exactly 10 feet away.
Stand 10 feet away from the letter on the wall. Hold the paper with the hole in it at arm’s length with both hands. Your arms should be parallel to the floor.
Look through the hole in the paper at the letter in the wall. When you can see the letter, have a friend cover first one eye, then the other. Don’t move or adjust your position. The eye that can see the letter is your dominant eye. If you can see it with both eyes, then neither eye is dominant in this task.

, This test is similar to the distance test, but it examines which eye you use when focusing up close. You can also do it with quickly and easily with household objects.This test can be done using a thimble, shot glass, or similar household object. Write a single letter on a piece of paper so that it is about 1/16th of an inch tall and wide. Tape this letter to the bottom of the inside of the thimble or shot glass.
Cover the thimble or shot glass with paper or aluminum foil. Fix it in place with a rubber band or tape. Make a small hole that is about 1/16th of an inch in the paper or foil. The hole should be over the letter so that you can see the letter when looking through the hole.
Put the thimble or shot glass on a table and lean over so that you can read the letter. Do not touch the thimble/shot glass or press your eye to the opening. Your head should be about 1 to 2 feet away.
Don’t move your head while you look at the letter. Have a friend cover one eye, then the other. The eye that can see the letter is your dominant eye. If you can see the letter with both eyes when the other is covered, you don’t have a dominant eye for this test.

, This test examines which eye is dominant at extremely close distances. The results may differ from the results on the other tests.Get a ruler. Write a single letter on a piece of paper. The letter should be about 1/16th of an inch high and wide. Tape the letter to the ruler so that it doesn’t move.
Hold the ruler out in front of you with both hands. The letter should be at eye level. Focus on the letter. Slowly, with both hands, move the ruler straight towards your nose.
Stop moving when one eye is no longer able to focus on the letter. That is the nondominant eye in this task. If both eyes remain focused until the ruler touches your nose, then neither eye is dominant in this task.

Improve your skills.,
Discuss the information with your eye doctor.,
Ask your eye doctor about eye strengthening exercises.",How to Determine Your Dominant Eye2," If you play sports or have hobbies that require you to depend solely on one eye, consider whether you are using your dominant eye. But remember that your eye dominance might vary based on distance. So be sure to consider your results on the most relevant eye dominance test. Then use that eye, rather than your nondominant eye. Your dominant eye may not be on the same side as your dominant hand or foot. Activities that require you to rely heavily on one eye include:Sighting a gun
Archery
Focusing a camera that does not have a large display screen
Looking through a telescope or microscope

, Knowing your dominant eye is particularly important for people who wear monovision contact lenses. If your doctor prescribes monovision contacts for you, he or she will probably also test your eye dominance. There are two types of monovision lenses:Monovision contacts. People with monovision contacts have a lens with a prescription for good distance vision in their dominant eye and a lens for reading in their nondominant eye.
Modified monovision. This involves wearing a bifocal or multifocal lens in the nondominant eye and a lens for distance vision in the dominant eye.

, If you feel that one of your eyes is too weak, you may be able to strengthen your eyes by doing exercises. But always consult your doctor before starting an exercise regime to avoid eye strain. Your doctor may recommend:Convergence exercises. In these exercises you bring a ruler or pen slowly towards your nose. When you start to see double, stop and refocus until you see one image. If you need to, move the pen away slightly and try again.
Practice focusing your nondominant eye close-up at reading distance, then far away. Ask your doctor how long you should maintain the focus at different locations. Then close your eyes to relax them for a minute.

Regularly inspect your dog's eyes.,
Look for signs of an eye infection.,
Watch the eyes of a sick dog more closely.,
Decide to take your dog to the vet.,
Understand how the veterinarian will diagnose an eye infection.,
Allow the vet to run additional tests to rule out more serious diseases.,
Follow the veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Canine Eye Infections," While we may take the time to check our dog's body for changes while we brush or groom it, its important to look in its eyes for changes as well. Pay attention to any redness or puffiness and keep an eye on these changes to make sure they go away quickly.


Just like humans, dogs can have allergic reactions to things in the environment. Just because a dog's eyes are red doesn't mean it has an eye infection. It could just be a little irritation.;
, Inflammation of the eye and a discharge from the eye are typical symptoms of an eye infection. However the latter can be misleading because conditions such as glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye) and allergies can also cause the cornea to change from white to red. Look for the general indicators of a problem, remembering that these symptoms could also signal a different problem:


Excessive blinking: The dog is blinking a lot to try and rid its eye of an unpleasant sensation, such as dryness or itching.Closing the eye: Again, the dog is closing its eye to get relief from an uncomfortable sensation on its eye.Rubbing the eye: Rubbing of the eye also signals an uncomfortable feeling on the eye that the dog is trying to get rid of. Discourage your dog from doing this, as it could lead to actual damage to the eye.
Red eye: The blood vessels in the eye are inflamed, which gives the eye an overall pink or ""red eye"" look. Red eye is also a sign of glaucoma, so you should seek veterinary care if red eye persists, as untreated glaucoma can cause blindness.Ocular discharge: Discharge associated with an eye infection will usually have a yellow-green tinge to it. Discharge caused by allergies or a simple irritation, on the other hand, is more likely to be clear.Sneezing or coughing: Sneezing or coughing, combined with other symptoms of an eye infection, could signal that your dog has an upper respiratory infection that is involving the eyes. Eye infections often happen without an additional infection but a yellow-green discharge from the eyes of a sneezing dog could indicate a larger infection. , Eye infections can be caused by bacteria or viruses that are stronger than the natural immune defenses in the eye. If your dog is already unwell, and thus its immune system is compromised, viruses or bacteria will have an easier time taking hold in the eye. Thus, any eye infection symptoms observed in an already sick dog should be taken very seriously.


If your dog's immune system is weakened, the dog has allergies, or there has been trauma to the eye (such as a scratch or hair rubbing on the cornea) then infection can take hold more easily., The symptoms for an irritated eye versus a seriously infected eye are not that different. This makes knowing when to take your dog to the vet difficult. However, the important thing is to recognize something is wrong and seek a professional opinion, even if the outcome is that the dog's eyes are just lightly irritated.


Most vets consider eye problems to be serious because of the potential for deteriorating vision and blindness. In other words, if your dog is having problems with its eyes you should remember that this is definitely a case of better safe than sorry. Take it in to see its vet as soon as possible.

, The vet will examine the dog generally to check its general health, listen to its chest for signs of respiratory infection, and check the size of its lymph nodes for signs of general health. The vet will then examine the dog's eyes, comparing one with the other.


The term ""conjunctivitis"" is not interchangeable with ""eye infection"". There is a slight technical difference between the two because conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the eye, and this inflammation isn't always caused by infection.Often times conjunctivitis affects both eyes, but one will be worse than the other. The veterinarian will then use an ophthalmoscope, an instrument that combines a light-source and magnification, in order to examine the surface and deeper structures of the eye.
The vet is checking for anything that has rubbed on the surface of the eye and caused irritation (such as stray hairs or eyelashes). He or she is also checking for inflammatory conditions affecting the inside of the eye, such as uveitis, which can be due to trauma, infection, or immune-mediated.

, For example, the vet may put a special dye, fluorescein, into the eye so that he or she can see signs of trauma or corneal ulceration. Additionally, the vet may use a tonometer to check the pressure within the globe. This rules out glaucoma.These tests will probably cost you more money, especially if you don't have pet insurance. Remember, however, that finding a serious problem early will likely cost you less money in the long run than treating a serious problem that is more advanced.

, If the eye is red, has a discharge, but all the other tests are normal or negative, then the vet will make a presumptive diagnosis of an eye infection. The vet will then start treatment as appropriate, which is usually an antibiotic eye ointment, gel, or drop that is applied to the eye once to four times daily depending on the formulation.


Treatment is usually given for a minimum of 5 - 7 days. You should apply the medicine for the full amount of days, even if the signs resolve quickly, in order to prevent antibiotic resistance from occurring."

Pay attention to changes to how you read and write.,
Note whether you need more light than normal to complete everyday activities such as reading, writing, eating, watching television or working on hobbies.

,
Consider whether you find yourself bumping into objects or brushing against walls while walking.,
Pay attention to an increase in traffic violations.,
Take note of any problems you experience while eating and drinking.,
Review whether or not you have trouble telling the difference between different colors.",How to Detect Vision Loss1," If you find yourself holding reading material closer to your face or at an angle or have difficulty writing within the lines on ruled paper, you may be experiencing vision loss.


Ask a friend with good vision to examine your handwriting to see if your writing has become unclear or messy.;
,, If you start moving more slowly to avoid hitting objects, this is also a warning sign. Difficulty or hesitation while moving around are vision loss symptoms.

, Trouble reading traffic signs, difficulty seeing the different colors on traffic lights, and problems reading your speedometer can all signal vision problems.


Ask a friend to ride with you on a short drive. Request that your friend evaluate your driving habits. Ask that the friend pay special attention to whether or not you stay within the lane lines, slow down adequately in advance of red lights or stop signs, or demonstrate over-cautiousness while driving.
Request a driving exam at your local department of motor vehicles office. The examiner will be able to tell you if you experience driving difficulties that could be related to vision impairment.
Stop driving until you have a vision exam and treatment if you are having difficulties seeing properly while driving.

, Trouble getting food on a fork, difficulty taking food from serving plates or bowls, frequently knocking over glasses, or spilling water over the edge of your glass can all be signs of vision problems.

, Ask a trusted friend to tell you whether you have started wearing mismatched clothing if you suspect problems.

Determine if you have cloudy vision.,
Pay attention to any issues with halos or glare.,
Notice double vision.,
Recognize any frequent changes in your prescription.",How to Detect Cataracts1," Cloudy vision can be a sign of cataracts. Though it can also be a symptom of many other illnesses, cloudy vision can also be a clear sign of cataracts.It's easy to confuse cloudy and blurry vision. While blurry vision is a lack of sharpness in your vision, cloudy vision is best described as a haziness or dullness in what you can see.
Cloudy vision is caused by a lack of transparency in your eye, in particular the lens. It can also be caused by diabetes, optic nerve damage, and macular degeneration.;
, Halos are usually an issue during the evening, but can occur other times when things are mostly dark. Glare, on the other hand, happens mostly during the daytime.Halos are a small circle that is around a source of light, such as headlights. They happen mostly during the evening or when it is dark outside.
Glare is light that seems too bright and does not help you see better. It can happen either during the day or night and can cause your eyes to be teary due to the too intense light source.

, Double vision can be caused by a variety of conditions. If you are suffering from double vision due to cataracts, your double vision will be due to problems with the lens of your eye.Double vision from cataracts can be in one or both eyes. If it's in both eyes, then you have cataracts in both eyes. Try this test: cover one eye at a time and notice if you still see double. If you do, then it could be the cataract. iI the double vision goes away after you cover one eye, you may actually have an ocular alignment problem (strabismus) instead of cataract as the cause of the double vision.
When your double vision is due to cataracts, it's an issue with your lens rather than your eye muscle or cornea. The main difference between double vision from cataracts or other issues is that light will be a factor in your double vision.

, Your prescription should be relatively stable, though it will likely become stronger with age. If you find your prescription is changing from year to year, it could be a sign of cataracts.


Proteins from your lens can build up and change your prescription. This may be a sign of fluctuating blood sugar as well.Cataracts could cause changes in prescription based on your vision quality. If your vision is changing regularly alongside other symptoms, you should schedule an appointment with your optometrist.

Use an Amsler Grid to check for loss of central vision.,
Evaluate your symptoms.",How to Detect Vision Loss3," The Amsler Grid is a chart you can use to test your central vision at home. Symptoms of central vision loss include difficulty identifying faces, reading text and signs. Central vision loss is associated with macular degeneration, which is when cells deteriorate in the macula, a part of the retina.


Request an Amsler Grid from your eye doctor. The chart is a grid of vertical and horizontal lines with a point in the center.
Hold the chart up in front of your face at eye level.
Cover 1 eye. Look at the central dot with your other eye, and then look at the vertical and horizontal lines while focusing on the dot.
Switch eyes and repeat the process.
Call your eye doctor if you experience the following during the test: blurriness, the appearance of curving or distorted lines or empty spots in areas of the grid.

, Make an appointment with your eye doctor if you suspect you may have loss of vision. An optometrist or ophthalmologist can perform tests to detect vision loss. Common tests your eye doctor may perform include:


Slit-lamp test: Using a microscope and a high-intensity light source the doctor can focus into a thin beam, the doctor will examine your eyes for signs of damage or injury. The eye doctor may also give you eye drops to dilate your pupils in order to examine the back of your eye.
Refraction test: The eye doctor will ask you to sit in a chair and look through a machine known as a refractor that uses lenses of differing strength to determine what, if any, corrective lenses are necessary for your eyes. You will view a chart with different letters or symbols through the refractor.
Tonometry: A tonometer measures the pressure inside your eyes. Your eye doctor will either use a tonometer to briefly touch your eye to measure the force needed to flatten the cornea, or the doctor may perform the air puff test. The doctor will shine a bright light in your eye and puff air in it. The light reflections change when the air hits your eye, and a machine can measure these changes and determine your eye pressure.

"
"
Visit your optometrist to be screened.,
Use light and magnification to examine your eye.,
Perform a pupil dilation test.,
Get a tonometry test.,
Schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist.",How to Detect Cataracts2," Your optometrist may give you a variety of tests as well as questions to determine if you may have cataracts. While some tests will be routine, other are more specific to detect cataracts.


Your optometrist will ask you questions about your vision such as what symptoms you're having and how long you've experienced them.
They will also perform a standard eye exam by using the eye chart and the viewing device to determine if you need corrective lenses.

, The test is called the slit-lamp examination. It lets your optometrist see the front of your eye under magnification to check for anything unusual.The slit refers to an intense line of light that your optometrist uses. Along with magnification, this helps your optometrist examine each section of the cornea, iris, and lens.
If cataracts are visible at this test, your optometrist may perform additional tests or diagnose you at this time. In either case, they will need to know the severity of the cataracts for a full plan of treatment.

, This test dilates your pupils and makes it easier for your optometrist to examine the retina at the back of your eye. If you get this test, get a ride home, since it may be unsafe for you to drive.When you're given a pupil dilation test, special drops are placed in your eye to dilate the pupil. The doctor may use either an ophthalmoscope or slit lamp for this examination.
Since the pupils are artificially dilated, your doctor will probably recommend sunglasses for your trip home to avoid excessive UV exposure to the eye.

, The tonometry test is also known as the pressure test. It lets your optometrist know if you have elevated pressure in your eyes, which can be dangerous and a sign of severe cataracts.Tonometry tests can be electronic, contact, or non-contact. The most familiar tonometry test is the eye puff test, in which a small puff of air flattens your cornea to check for increased eye pressure.The tonometry test also tests for glaucoma. Since many of the symptoms of cataracts can also be symptoms of glaucoma, it's a good idea to make sure this is not your problem instead of cataracts.

, If your optometrist thinks you may have cataracts, they may refer you to an ophthalmologist. An ophthalmologist will make the final diagnosis and determine a treatment plan.Your ophthalmologist may suggest corrective lenses if your cataracts are not severe; however, in many cases, cataracts are serious enough to require surgery.
Surgery for cataracts is generally a routine, outpatient procedure. In this surgery, your ophthalmologist removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with an artificial lens.
After the surgery, you'll want to have someone drive you home. Your vision may be blurry for a while after the surgery; however, if it's still blurry after a few hours or if you experience any pain, contact your ophthalmologist immediately."

Know your risk factors for getting cataracts.,
Realize that advanced age may cause cataracts.,
Limit overexposure to sunlight.,
Know that diabetes, obesity, or high blood pressure can cause cataracts.,
Avoid smoking or drinking too much alcohol.",How to Detect Cataracts3," There are a few big risks for getting cataracts that depend upon your lifestyle, age, and diet. Additionally, previous eye injury can make you more likely to get cataracts.While some risk factors for cataracts can be prevented, others are inevitable with age. If you're at an advanced age, you'll want to get checked for cataracts on a regular basis.
Some risk factors for cataracts can be prevented. A change in diet, management of diabetes or blood pressure, or ceasing drinking or smoking can minimize your risks for diabetes.

, At age 75, nearly 70% of all people have cataracts. With age, your eyes become less flexible and more prone to the accumulation of protein that causes cataracts.Our eyes' lenses become thicker with age, making them less transparent and less flexible. This can lead to cataracts due to protein build up.
Cataracts are pretty common in older people. If you're over 40, it's important to get checked for cataracts on a regular basis.

, Sunlight exposure can also damage your eyes and cause cataracts later in life. Stay out of direct sunlight without UV protected sunglasses to protect your eyes.Since one of the major causes of cataracts is cumulative exposure to sunlight, a simple precaution is to wear sunglasses that block UV rays. Wearing a hat with a brim can decrease exposure by 30 – 50 percent.
High altitude can also contribute to cataracts due to overexposure to sunlight. If you live at a high altitude, it's especially important to keep your eyes protected from the sun.

, Since all three issues deal with protein creation, excessive proteins in the eye can create cataracts later in life. If possible, manage any of these issues to minimize cataract development.Diabetes can cause a number of eye-related illnesses. High blood sugar creates the conditions for cataract development.Obesity or high blood pressure can also cause cataracts. Losing weight and taking blood pressure medicine can potentially reduce the risk of cataracts later in life.

, Both activities dramatically increase your likelihood of developing cataracts. While an occasional drink will not severely increase your chances, excessive drinking or smoking can cause major problems.


Smoking cigarettes can double your chances of developing cataracts. Additionally, the longer you smoke, the worse your risks are for cataracts. More than two drinks per day can potentially increase your risks for cataracts. However, moderate drinking can actually reduce your chances.

Seek medical help.,
Try an eye drop recommended by your doctor.,
Get a prescription for antibiotics to fight infection.,
Get surgery for severe damage.,
Small corneal abrasions typically heal in 1-3 days.",How to Deal with the Pain from a Scratched Cornea1," A scratched cornea can be caused by some things you might not expect, like improperly fitted or maintained contact lenses, rubbing your eyes vigorously, a bacterial infection, or when undergoing surgery under general anesthesia, in addition to the more obvious causes such having your eye poked or some foreign object or matter getting stuck in your eye.As other conditions can cause symptoms similar to an abrasion, but would be treated differently, go to an opthalmologist or to the emergency room right away. You want confirmation you are dealing with a scratched cornea. Your doctor can also give you guidance on how to treat your condition safely. If you notice any of the following symptoms, see a doctor:Pain
A feeling of grittiness in the eye
Headaches
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Blurry vision, especially after an injury to the eyeSensitivity to light;
, Not all commercial eye drops are safe for treating a scratched cornea. In fact, using over the counter eyedrops may make the condition worse. Eyedrops recommended by your doctor may contain antibiotics or steroids which can help prevent infection, alleviate the pain, and reduce inflammation or potential scarring.If you're in a lot of pain, talk to your doctor about eyedrops during the appointment instead of attempting to select eyedrops on your own.Eyedrops help with pain by keeping the eye lubricated. They can also prevent an infection, which can be a complication of a scratched cornea.
Use only eyedrops your doctor recommends and closely follow the doctor's instructions when using them.
Eyedrops may not require a prescription even if they're recommended by your doctor. However, never use over-the-counter eyedrops unless your doctor advised you to do so when you have a scratched cornea.

, Oral antibiotics are not commonly prescribed for a scratched cornea, but if your doctor does prescribe one, take it exactly as directed. Take all your antibiotics, even after your cornea feels better.Talk to your doctor about any existing medications before taking antibiotics. You want to make sure antibiotics do not interfere with any existing medications you are taking.
While your doctor may use topical painkillers in the exam room, these should never be used at home. They can be very dangerous when not applied by a medical doctor. Oral pain medication may be prescribed if pain or light sensitivity is severe., People who continuously have pain after a corneal abrasion or have permanent and major damage may need surgery. If you need surgery, the doctor will go over the procedure and recovery with you.

, Larger or more severe abrasions will take longer. Deep scratches can cause infections, scars, and other complications. Call your doctor with any unusual symptoms or if you have any concerns. "

Don’t wear contact lenses following the injury.,
Do not wear an eye patch unless instructed by your doctor.,
Don’t rub your eyes.,
Use an ice compress if recommended by your doctor.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Get lots of rest.",How to Deal with the Pain from a Scratched Cornea2," If you are a contact lens wearer, switch to wearing your glasses until it is healed. Contact lenses can stress the damaged cornea and also cause infection. This can make the pain of a scratched cornea much worse.Talk to your doctor about when it is safe to put your contacts back in. Healing times will vary and only your doctor can give you a safe recommendation as to when you can use your contacts again.
Wear sunglasses to help with light sensitivity., Eye patches likely do not help heal minor scratches and may slow down healing.In some cases an eye patch may be recommended to aid in comfort during the healing process.An eye patch may be necessary for light sensitivity following an abrasion., When you injure your cornea, it can create an itchy sensation that you may feel tempted to scratch. Try to avoid rubbing your eyes, as doing so can increase the damage done to your cornea and infect the eye.If you're struggling with the temptation to scratch your eyes, try doing something that occupies your hands. You could, for example, take up knitting while the cornea heals.
You can also do something like wear mittens as this can make rubbing your eyes difficult.

, For small abrasions, your doctor may prescribe ice compresses for 24-48 hours to reduce swelling. After this, warm compresses should be used., Eat lots of fruits and vegetables while your eye heals to get all the nutrients you need to help speed up the healing process.You need to eat foods rich in antioxidants and vitamins. This will help your body heal faster and fight off any potential infections.


Vitamin C can help with eye health. The recommended daily amount is at least 90 mg for men and 75 mg for women. Extra health benefits occur above 250 mg. Good sources of vitamin C are broccoli, cantaloupe, cauliflower, guava, bell peppers, grapes, oranges, berries, lychees, and squash.
Vitamin E can also help your cornea. The recommended daily amount is at least 22 IU for men and 33 IU for women, but more benefits occur at levels above 250 mg. Good sources of vitamin E include almonds, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, spinach, peanut butter, collard greens, avocados, mango, hazelnuts, and Swiss chard.
Vitamin B can also help your eye heal. Sources of vitamin B include wild salmon, skinless turkey, bananas, potatoes, lentils, halibut, tuna, cod, soy milk, and cheese.
Lutein and Zeaxanthin can help if you consume more than 6mg a day. Both lutein and zeaxanthin are naturally found in the retina and lens. They work as natural antioxidants, aiding in absorption of harsh light and UV rays. Both are plentiful in leafy green vegetables.Discuss any dietary changes with your doctor before adding supplements. Always follows your doctor's advice before changing diet.

, When you allow your body to rest, it can put its efforts towards healing your injured eye. Try to take it easy for the days following the injury. If possible, take time off from work and school.

Do not take topical medications at home.,
Do not remove objects from your eye without medical help.,
Take steps to avoid a reoccurrence.",How to Deal with the Pain from a Scratched Cornea3," When you're in the emergency room or doctor's office, topical medications may be applied to your eye or the area around the eye. Such medications are only safe when applied by a medical doctor. You should not attempt to treat a scratched cornea with topical medications on your own, especially not an over the counter topical medication.The only medications you should take are those prescribed or recommended by your doctor. Usually, your doctor will recommend oral painkillers for a scratched cornea.

, A scratched cornea can be caused by a foreign object in the eye. It can be tempting to try to remove this object on your own, especially if it's causing your pain or irritation. However, it can be dangerous to remove anything from your eye on your own if you have a scratched cornea. A doctor can remove the object for you., Scratching your cornea repeatedly is not good for your eye health. It can increase the chance you will need surgery. Work on taking steps to prevent a scratched cornea from reoccurring the future.Wear protective glasses, such as sunglasses and goggles, to keep objects out of your eye. This is important when you're doing things like hiking or walking, or if you work in an environment where your eyes are at risk.
Make sure to clean your contact lenses thoroughly before putting them into your eyes. Never wear contact lenses longer than recommended.
If you get dirt or dust in your eyes, do not rub them. Try to rinse out your eyes with eyedrops. If you cannot get a foreign object out of your eye, seek medical help instead of attempting to treat it on your own.

Rest your eyes.,
Use eye-drops or artificial tears.,
Consider using an eye gel for extreme eye dryness.,
Take allergy medication.,
Try an eye rinse.,
Place a warm compress over your eyelids.,
Relax with cool, damp teabags over your eyes.",How to Clear Red Eyes1," For most causes of red eyes — a corneal scratch, lack of sleep, eye strain from staring at a computer screen, too much sun exposure, long road trips — rest is the best medicine. Get some extra sleep, and minimize your time looking at computers, TVs, books, and your phone. Try listening to the radio or a book on tape instead. Even if you can't take time off to give your eyes a whole day of rest, be sure to give them smaller breaks.


If reading or working at a computer, you should stop every fifteen minutes and stare at a distant object for at least 30 seconds. This change in focal point will help to relax your eye muscles.
Every two hours, take a 15 minute break from your screen to rest your eyes. Go for a walk, work out, have a snack, make phone calls — anything but staring at your computer screen or phone.;
, For occasional eye redness, you can get relief by using eye drops, which are also sometimes called artificial tears. These are available at any drugstore, and only cost a few dollars. They lubricate and cleanse your eye, reducing redness and irritation. They come in four types:With preservatives — Preservatives like benzalkonium chloride, oliexetonium, polyhexamethylene biguanide, polyquad, purite, and sodium perborate (GenAqua)prevent bacteria from growing, but they also irritate your eyes. If your eyes are sensitive or if you will be using the drops for an extended period of time, preservatives should be avoided.Without preservatives — Systane, GenTeal, Refresh, Thera Tears, and Bausch and Lomb, amongst others, all sell preservative-free eye drops.
For contacts — If you wear contacts, look for drops designed specifically for use with them.
Whitening / anti-red eye — Do not use whitening drops like Visine, Clear Eyes, and All Clear. Whitening eye drops will actually exacerbate eye redness over time.

, Gels and ointments are thicker and last longer than drops, but they can also blur your vision for a time. That makes them best for use just before you go to sleep, so as to prevent your eyes from drying out overnight.


Be sure to use a hot compress or scrub your eyelids with mild soap before applying gels or lotions. This will prevent them from clogging glands and ducts.Do not use gels or ointments if you have been diagnosed with meibomian gland disease., Seasonal allergies, pet allergies, or environmental allergies can all cause red eyes. Allergies usually occur with other symptoms such as itchiness and tearing, and are typically worst in the morning. The reason is twofold: first, sleeping in a home with allergens exposes you to their effects for a prolonged period of time, and second, seasonal allergies are worst in the morning when there is more pollen in the air.To deal with allergies:Try an oral antihistamine, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), desloratadine (Clarinex), fexofenadine (Allegra), Levocetirizine (Xyzal), or loratadine (Claritin).
Use medicated eye drops that contain antihistamine or anti-inflammatories, including azelastine (Optivar), emedastine (Emadine), ketotifen (Alaway, Zaditor), or olopatadine (Pataday, Patanol).
Keep your windows closed during allergy season to reduce your exposure to pollen.
Keep pets out of your bedroom, and especially out of your bed.
Try an air purifier to keep in your home, which may help reduce the presence of allergens.

, An eye rinse helps to remove irritants in your eye that can contribute to redness. In addition, it moisturizes and cools your eye. You can rinse your eyes with lukewarm water by letting a stream run over your eye, using an eyecup, or standing in the shower and letting the water run into your eye (do not spray it directly into your eye). For an even greater soothing effect, consider using a specially prepared eye rinse:Boil a cup of distilled water.
Add a tablespoon of eyebright, chamomile flowers, or crushed fennel seeds.
Remove from heat, cover the pot, and let it steep for 30 minutes.
Strain the liquid into a sterilized container using a coffee filter.
You can keep the rinse in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.

, Eyelid inflammation can block the flow of moisturizing oil to your eyes. A warm compress can help to unblock your oil ducts. Hold a clean, dry washcloth under warm running water until it is soaked and then wring out the excess water. Then fold the washcloth in half and place it over your closed eyes. Relax with the washcloth over your eyes for five to 10 minutes., Green tea and chamomile tea both contain chemicals that can soothe irritated skin, reduce inflammation, and open blocked oil ducts. Steep two tea bags, then place them in the refrigerator or freezer until they are cool, before placing them over your closed eyes for five minutes."

Quit smoking and avoid smoky environments.,
Do not overuse whitening eye drops.",How to Clear Red Eyes2," The tiniest bit of dust can cause irritation if lodged in your eye. If your eyes feel scratchy, do not rub them, as this might scratch your cornea.Instead, it is best to wash your eye. You can do this by placing eye drops or saline in your eye and blinking rapidly. For an even more effective wash:Use clean hands to hold your eye open under a gentle stream of lukewarm running water.
In the shower by allowing the water to hit your forehead and holding your eye open as the water runs down your face. Or, you can wash your eye with an eyewash station or an eyecup.
If you have an object in your eye, you may have trouble opening and closing your eyelid.

, Not getting enough sleep is a common cause of red eyes. If you're also feeling tired and groggy throughout the day, your red eyes might be the result of insufficient sleep.Adults require between seven to nine hours of sleep per night, but some people may require more or less sleep to be at their best., Even if you're getting enough sleep, you can still tire your eyes out by spending too much time in front of the computer or watching TV. This is because people blink less when staring at a screen, and because their eyes are forced to focus at the same distance for hours at a time, producing eye strain. Give your eyes a 15 minute break every two hours and take short 30 second breaks every 15 minutes.For long breaks, take a short walk and focus on things in the distance, or take a short 15 minute nap to give your eyes a chance to catch up with your busy schedule.
For short breaks, look up and away from your computer for thirty seconds and focus on something in the distance, such as a tree out your window or a picture on the other side of your room.

, Some studies show that excessive exposure to sunlight or wind can cause redness in the eyes. If you wear protective sunglasses when you're outside, you can protect your eyes from the wind and UV rays that can irritate them. Choose wraparound sunglasses that offer 99–100% protection from UVA and UVB rays.Wearing sunglasses is essential for good eye health later in life. Too much exposure to the sun can lead to problems like macular degeneration and cataracts later in life.

, Contacts can sometimes cause eye redness, which may be related to an infection, lack of oxygen to your eyes, or contact irritation.Before putting in your contacts, place a few drops of saline solution or eye lubricant in your eyes and blink several times. This will clean the surface of your eye, so that irritants don't get trapped underneath your contacts.
Dirty, torn, or misshapen contacts can irritate your eyes and cause infection. Follow your eye doctor’s instructions for keeping your contact lenses clean. If you use disposable contact lenses, never wear them more than once.
Do not sleep with your contact lenses.
Avoid wearing your contact lenses when swimming or showering.

, Smoke is a common cause of eye redness. If you smoke, try your best to quit smoking and keep your distance when others are smoking around you.In addition to reducing your eye redness, quitting smoking has lots of other health benefits., While drops that moisturize your eye are an effective way to treat redness, eye drops specifically designed to whiten your eyes can actually make the problem worse. These drops contain vasoconstrictors — chemicals that shrink the blood vessels on the surface of your eye. If you use them too much, your body builds up a resistance to them, making your eyes become even redder as soon as the effect of the chemical wears off.Common drops containing vasoconstrictors are Clear Eyes, Visine, and All Clear. Chemicals to avoid include:Ephedrine hydrochloride
Naphazoline hydrochloride
Phenylephrine hydrochloride
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride

Seek immediate medical attention for serious symptoms.,
Go to your doctor if redness persists for more than two days.,
Consult your optometrist if your red eyes persist.",How to Clear Red Eyes3," Red eyes accompanied by other serious symptoms can be a sign of a more significant problem such as a stroke or neurological disorder. Go to the emergency room or call 911 if:Your eye is red because of an injury.
You have a headache with blurry vision and confusion.
You see halos around lights.
You are nauseous and/or vomiting.

, If your redness persists despite the above remedies, if you are on blood thinners, or if the redness is accompanied by pain, changes in vision, or any sort of discharge, you should consult your doctor.Common medical causes of red eyes include:Pink Eye (conjunctivitis) — An infection of the transparent membrane that covers your eyes. It is treated with antibiotics and/or topical antihistamines.Chronic Dry Eye — This occurs when your eyes do not produce enough tears to lubricate them. It can be managed through punctual plugs (they plug the small holes in your eyelid that drain moisture), eye drops, and medication.Diabetic Red Eye — High blood sugar from diabetes can damage the tiny blood vessels in your eye, leading to red eyes. If diabetic, be sure to get regular eye exams. If untreated, diabetes can lead to loss of vision.Vasculitis — Occurs when the body's immune system attack blood vessels. It is treated through the use of steroids and other medicines to reduce inflammation.Glaucoma — An increase in eye pressure that can cause blindness. It can usually be treated with eye drops that relieve pressure.
Keratitis — An inflammation of the cornea that may be caused by wearing your contacts for too long or a minor injury. It may be accompanied by a bacterial infection. , Persistent red eyes that do not respond to medical treatment are often the cause of eye strain brought on by an inaccurate prescription or the need for bifocals.


A prescription that is too strong will force the muscles of your eyes to constantly work to bring objects into focus, resulting in strain and redness. It is better to have a prescription that is too weak rather than too strong.If you find yourself having to lean close to your computer screen to see it clearly, you may need bifocals to help you see clearly at multiple focal points.

Know that there are several types of eye protection available.,
Safety glasses.,
Goggles


Goggles protect your eyes against both a front and a side blow.,
Face shields


Face shields protect the face from liquid splashes, dust, and airborne refuse.,
Special protection for welders.,Always follow the instructions carefully when using any eye protection device.",How to Choose Appropriate Eye Protection," Some provide protection from dust and debris. Others protect your eyes from burning rays and molten metals. The following is a list of eye protection devices and what they are used for.;
,


Regular eyeglasses and sunglasses provide protection from debris and rays that comes toward the front of your face only.
If you wear eyeglasses, use impact resistant lenses.
Safety glasses have heavier lenses and can withstand shock better than an ordinary eyeglass lens.
Use safety glasses that have been treated for anti-fog.
Make sure the glasses fit properly and are secure.

,
Chemical splash or unvented goggles protect against chemical vapors and liquids.
Always wear goggles when striking hardened metal and hardened metal surfaces to protect the eyes from flying metal debris.
Use a face shield over safety glasses or goggles for even better protection.






Goggles designed after ski-type goggles with high air flow reduce fogging and provide better debris and splash protection.

,
Standard face shields offer very little protection against high impact. There are special types of shields available that provide impact resistance.
To be extra cautious, you can wear your goggles or safety glasses under the face shield.






Face shields should be worn if you are using a sprayer, chipper, grinder, or are near chemicals or blood-borne hazards.







,


Always wear a welding helmet. This protects your eyes from the burning rays. It also protects your face and neck from the splatter of molten metal and slag.
Ensure that the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade if welding with 200 amperes or less. Consult a welder's safety instruction manual if you are in doubt of which helmet is best for the job.
Protect your eyes after you have lifted your helmet.

Do not rub your eye.,
Wash your hands.,
Take your contact lenses out.,
Start with your face in a downward position.,
Rinse your eyes with water.,
Use a specific eye-washing sink or station if there is one available.,
Use a cotton swab or a piece of tissue.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Be aware of what to expect.,
Know when to return for follow-up.",How to Clear Eyes," The first thing to be aware of, if you have gotten dirt or another substance into your eye, is not to touch it or rub it with your hands. This can make it harder to get out, and it also poses the risk of infection by getting the dirt and germs from your hands into your eye.Note that even if your eye is sore, itchy, or otherwise irritated, it is very important not to touch it at this point.
Oftentimes the irritation will settle once you get the dirt or foreign substance out.;
, Prior to clearing your eye (which you will do by washing out your eye), it is important to ensure that your hands are clean. Even though you will not be touching your eye directly with your hands, you will be using your hands to collect water for cleaning so it is important that they be sanitized.Washing with soap and warm water will do the trick.

, If you are wearing contact lenses, it is important to remove them prior to washing your eye. Also throw them out, as you will not want to re-use these contact lenses.

, As you prepare to wash your eye, you will want to make sure your head is facing downward, and not straight or tilted backward. Otherwise, you risk having the foreign substance wash further into your eye, rather than coming out when you rinse it with water.


With your head facing downward, start by blinking a few times. Blinking releases some natural lubrication from your tear ducts that may be enough for the object to fall out (as long as you are still facing in a downward position).

, Assuming the foreign object is still lodged in your eye, the next step is to cup both of your hands under the sink faucet and to fill them with warm water. Then, lower the affected eye into the water in your hands, keeping the eye open. Just let it sit in the water, and hopefully this will be enough for the object to dislodge and come out.


Again, be sure to face downward the whole time so that the object or dirt comes out of your eye, rather than going further into it.

, Oftentimes, in places such as chemistry labs, there is a specific eye-washing station available. The ""faucet"" is designed to directly shoot water into your eye, so that you do not need to use your hands to cup the water. This is more effective than a regular sink at removing dirt or debris from your eyes, so if one is available your best bet is to use it.

, If you look in the mirror and see a foreign object on your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber), you can try using a cotton swab or a piece of tissue and pressing it gently onto the affected part of your eye. Oftentimes, the foreign substance will stick to it, and it can be removed in this way., If you cannot get the foreign substance out of your eye, it is very important to see your doctor promptly (normally this means going to the Emergency Room so that you can be seen right away). Especially if you have metal stuck in your eye, or any other sharp substance that may have punctured the surface of your eye, it is very important to see a doctor and not to try and remove any sharp objects on your own.The doctors have special equipment where they can see your eye close-up and use special tools to remove any foreign objects.
Be sure to never try and use ""tools"" yourself - such as tweezers, toothpicks, or other sharp objects to get something out of your eye - as you risk causing further damage to your eye., Your doctor will start by examining your eye using something called a ""slit lamp.""This looks like a very large microscope, and it will be used to look into your eyes and to magnify the view so that your doctor can see better and take note of any small objects or debris that may be lodged in your eye.


During the slit lamp examination, your doctor will use an eyedropper to put a dye on your eye. The dye will change color if and when it comes into contact with foreign material on the eye, so it is a very helpful tool for doctors to locate which areas of your eye need treatment.After identifying the location of any foreign substances, your doctor will use a special sharp tool that is designed to remove objects from your eye.It may look intimidating, but physicians have been specifically trained how to use it in safe ways.
Your doctor will also use anesthetic eyedrops prior to removing the object, so that the affected eye will not feel pain., After the doctor has removed the foreign body from your eye, your eye should heal and begin to feel better within a few days. If it does not - and if you develop any symptoms of increased pain, redness, or unusual discharge from your eye - do not hesitate to book a follow-up appointment with your physician."

Use a cold compress.,
Flush out your eyes.,
Use eye drops.,
Avoid rubbing your eyes.,
Protect your eyes.,
Take out your contacts.,
Try an over-the-counter antihistamine.",How to Comfort a Sore and Itchy Eye1," If your eyes are itchy and irritated, try putting a cold compress over your eyes. This can also help if they are swollen and red. Grab a soft washcloth or towel. Soak it in cool water and wring it out. Close your eyes and lean your head back, placing the compress on your face. Remove after about 20 minutes. Repeat as many times as necessary to prevent further itching.You can also lie down if holding your head back for that long hurts your neck.;
, If your eyes are itchy and irritated, you may need to flush them out. This can also be necessary if you get an allergen, such as dust, in your eye. To start this, lean over a sink and turn on lukewarm water. Lean down slowly under a lightly running but not too harsh stream of water from the faucet. Let it run over your eyes for a few minutes, or until you think you removed all the allergens.


You can also do this in the shower if leaning over a sink is too hard. Just make sure the water isn't too hot. You don't want to injure your eyes with too much heat., There are two different kinds of over-the-counter eye drops you can use. You can use antihistamine eye drops, which have allergy fighting medications in them that should relieve itching and redness. You can also use lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears. These help relieve itchiness by adding more moisture into your eyes and allowing them wash away allergens.


Popular brands of antihistamine eye drops include Alaway or Zaditor. Brands of artificial tears include Clear Eyes, Artificial Tears, and Visine Tears.
You can also get prescription antihistamine eye drops from your doctor, such as Patanol. However, many experts believe that over-the-counter options work just as well for mild to moderate cases.Try placing artificial tears in the fridge — cool drops feel better and can soothe burning itchy eyes.

, When you are suffering from itchy eyes, rubbing them is one of the worst things you can do. This most likely will just make symptoms worse. It puts pressure and rubs against the already irritated surface of your eyes. It can also spread allergens to your eyes through your hands, which will just make the itching worse.


Avoid touching your eyes at all. This means you should steer clear of wearing eye makeup when you are having an eye allergy attack., If you are bothered by outside allergens, wear sunglasses when you go outside. This will add an extra layer of protection on your eyes that will keep out these allergens more than leaving your eyes exposed.


You can also do this when you are cleaning. If you know that dust or pet dander bother your allergies, wear protective eye wear in the house when you clean.
Also avoid touching your eyes right after you pet an animal if pet dander irritates your allergies., When your eyes are irritated, keeping your contacts in will only make them worse. They rub against your eyes, which are already irritated. They can also collect allergens, which will make your symptoms worse. Instead, switch out your contacts for glasses. This will give your eyes a break and has the added bonus of protecting your eyes for possible allergens as well.


If you don't have glasses, switch to single use disposable contacts. This will help prevent any possible allergen build up on your contacts.
Remember to wash your hands well before putting your contacts in or taking them out. You don't want to spread allergens unnecessarily., Eye allergies are caused by mostly the same allergens as nose allergies. This includes dust, mold, pet dander, grass, and pollen. Because they are the same, over the counter antihistamines can help relieve your eye symptoms.


For non-drowsy antihistamines you can take during the day, you can try loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), or cetirizine (Zyrtec).
Benadryl is also effective, but it can make you drowsy."
"
Know the symptoms.,
See a doctor.,
Take an antibiotic.,
Follow home remedies.",How to Comfort a Sore and Itchy Eye2," Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is another common cause of itchy eyes. If your eyes are just itchy, you likely don't have pink eye. However, if your itchiness is combined with multiple other symptoms, you may have pink eye. These can include:Redness
Burning
Liquid discharge from the eye, which can be white, clear, gray, or yellow
Swelling
Watering
Gritty feeling

, Pink eye can be either viral or bacterial and it is highly contagious for up to two weeks. You want to get it treated as soon as you can so you lower the risk of passing it on. See your doctor at the first signs of pink eye.


Your doctor will examine your eye and decide what kind of pink eye you have. If he suspects a larger issue, she may run additional tests., Most cases of pink eye are caused by a viral infection, but if your doctor decides you have bacterial pink eye, she may prescribe antibiotics. These can reduce the time you have bacterial pink eye from a week to a couple of days. However, antibiotics will not work on viral pink eye., There is no treatment for viral pink eye since there is no cure for viruses. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication if your pink eye is caused by certain forms of viruses. For these cases, and for any type of pink eye, follow the simple home remedies that work for eye allergies, such as cold compresses, contact removal, and limited eye contact or rubbing."
"
Know the symptoms.,
Reduce the causes.,
Rest your eyes.,
Change your eyeglass prescription.,
Adjust your work environment.",How to Comfort a Sore and Itchy Eye3," Another common symptom of itchy eyes is eye fatigue. It can cause itchy eyes, as well as sore or tired eyes. You may also have blurred vision, watery eyes, or be more sensitive to bright lights.See your doctor right away if you have double vision.Prolonged eyestrain can be a sign of another issue, so if it persists, see a doctor., Eye fatigue is most often caused by staring too long at one thing, whether it be the road, a computer screen, or a book. Try to reduce your time doing these activities if you can.


Trying to read or work on a project in dim light can also cause eye strain. Add light to help reduce strain.However, if you're working on the computer or watching television, lights that are too bright can cause problems. Adjust lighting so there isn't a glare., In order to reduce eye fatigue, you need to rest your eyes. To do this, follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, glance away from what you are focusing on for 20 seconds. The object you look at should be at least 20 feet away. Repeat this every 20 minutes while you are reading or using a computer or looking at one thing for a long time.

, If you are suffering from eye fatigue, you may have the wrong eyeglass prescription. Make an appointment with your eye doctor and explain what has been going on with your eyes. They may suggest a different prescription for your everyday glasses or possibly suggest a pair of work glasses. This may help reduce fatigue from your computer or reading distance., When you are working on a computer, you are likely to get eye fatigue. While you work, your screen should be about 2 feet (0.6 m) away from you. It should also be slightly below eye level, or where your glance would normally fall.


You should also keep your screen clean, because any dirt, dust, or smears on the surface can make your eyes strain to see through it.Use a microfiber wipe and a screen cleaning solution to wipe down your screens. Turn off your screens before cleaning."

Avoid excessive alcohol.,
Learn the connection between gallstones and pancreatitis.,
Avoid fatty or fried foods.,
Limit foods with lots of simple sugar.,
Don’t crash diet.,
Eat lots of whole grains.,
Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Drink water.",How to Avoid Foods That Cause Pancreatitis," There is a very clear link between excessive drinking and pancreatitis. Reducing your alcohol intake is one of the most important things you can do for your body if you are prone to pancreatitis. About seven out of 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis are the result of long-term, heavy drinking.Alcohol and biliary disease are the number one and number two causes of pancreatitis. Try to eliminate all alcohol from your diet.
Cigarettes increase the negative effects of alcohol on the pancreas, so it’s also important to stop smoking.
If you or someone you know drinks excessively, it may be time to seek help. Seek help from a rehab facility or a recovery group such as Alcoholics Anonymous.;
, Gallstones are one of the major reasons that acute pancreatitis occurs. They occur when too much cholesterol builds up in your bile (the stuff in your liver that helps digest fats).You can eliminate gallstones by taking medication or by having your gallbladder removed. Gall bladder surgery is commonplace and carries the risk of infection and bleeding, but otherwise it is safe procedure.

, Anything high in saturated or trans fats is a no-no if you are prone to pancreatitis. Particularly if you are recovering from one attack, fatty foods can cause another bout of pancreatitis.Try to skip foods such as these:Fatty meats, such as organ meat, bacon, pepperoni, and salami
Greasy foods, such as burgers and french fries
Foods high in trans fats, such as packaged baked goods, fast food, and frozen pizza
Full-fat milk, yogurt, or cheese

, Foods high in simple sugars increase you triglyceride levels (the amount of fat carried in your blood), which can lead to gallstones and pancreatitis. These include sugary sweets and high-calorie beverages. Some big ones to skip includeSoda
Cakes, cookies, and pies
Candy
Processed foods like jams and some condiments

, If you’re trying to lose weight, you should do so gradually, or your body will freak out. Rapid weight loss can cause your liver to overproduce cholesterol, which will increase your risk of gallstones., White flour can send your triglyceride levels (the amount of fat carried in your blood) through the roof, which can lead to pancreatitis attacks. Skip white bread and any cereal, rice, or pasta made with refined white flour. Opt for whole grain versions of these foods instead., In particular, look for foods high in vitamin B and iron (like leafy greens). Most fruits and vegetables are full of antioxidants, which help prevent pancreatitis attacks.In particular, try to eatGreens
Berries and cherries
Tomatoes
Squash
Bell peppers

, The National Pancreas Foundation recommends that anyone who has ever been diagnosed with pancreatitis keep a water bottle with them at all times to avoid dehydration (which causes flare ups). Gatorade and other sports drinks are also okay, but watch out for high sugar content."

Avoid carbonated beverages.,
Limit dairy products.,
Skip the gum.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Consider limiting wheat or gluten-containing foods.,
Limit your portion sizes and chew slowly.,
Manage stress.,
Stop smoking.,
Maintain proper oral health if you wear dentures.,
Sit up during and after a meal.,
Be mindful of dietary supplements.,
Track your symptoms with a food and lifestyle journal.,
Consider talking to your doctor.,
Engage in regular exercise.,
Try taking over-the-counter medications.",How to Avoid Hidden Causes of Bloating," Many people use carbonated drinks, especially ginger-flavored sodas, to help relieve bloating or general stomach upset; however, these bubbly drinks should be avoided to help minimize bloating.Carbonated beverages are made by forcing carbon dioxide into different drinks. This is the source of gas and air that you end up swallowing and consuming as you drink sodas and other bubbly beverages.
This air travels from your stomach down into your intestines which is the reason why these drinks can cause bloating.
Avoid all drinks like: sodas, beer, sparkling wine, sparkling water, fermented teas and juices and seltzer water.;
, One food group in particular that may cause bloating and gas is the dairy food group. This can be hard to pinpoint as the cause of your bloating symptoms doesn't always occur immediately after consuming these foods.It takes about two hours after you eat dairy for the bloating to occur. The food has to leave the stomach and get into the intestines.


One cause of bloating and gas is when sugars (like the lactose found in dairy products) aren't well digested and ferment in your colon. This causes your colon to fill with air which causes bloating and gas.
All dairy products, especially milk, have high amounts of lactose. If you eat dairy products regularly, you might want to consider minimizing these or avoiding them. If you notice the amount of bloating decreases or goes away completely, dairy foods might be the root cause.
In place of dairy foods, you can use non-dairy alternatives like: soy or almond milk, vegan cheeses, soy or coconut-based yogurts or even coconut ice cream.
Yogurt has a high amount of lactose, but most people digest it better than milk.

, Chewing gum is another way that excess air can get into your GI tract and cause bloating. On top of that, sugar-free gum, which contains artificial sweeteners, may also be causing your symptoms.Whenever you chew gum (sugar-free or regular), you swallow small amounts of air. This can cause you to burp or becomes trapped in your intestinal tract causing bloating.
In addition, sugar-free gum and other sugar-free mints and candies can cause bloating. Some people are sensitive to artificial sweeteners since these are not digested well in the GI tract.
If you chew gum, skip the artificial sweeteners. Or, just suck on a regular mint without artificial sweeteners.

, Another cause of bloating you may not be aware of is sodium. You may feel like you're retaining water with higher amounts of sodium, but this can also cause bloating.When you eat a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium, it's natural for your body to retain some water. This is especially true for women.
In addition, many processed foods are higher in fat. High-fat meals delay the emptying of your stomach which can make you feel uncomfortably full and bloated for long periods of time.Avoid high-fat, high-sodium processed foods like: frozen meals, canned meals and soups, fast foods, fried foods, pizzas and processed meats.

, One lesser known cause of bloating is gluten and wheat-based foods. This isn't a common or very likely cause of bloating; however, those who are sensitive to gluten or wheat will experience bloating when eating these foods.


Similar to dairy foods, wheat-based foods and those that contain gluten leave little amounts of undigested carbohydrates in your GI system. These ferment causing excess gas and air to become trapped, which causes the sensation of being bloated.Wheat-based foods also contain gluten — anything made with wheat will have gluten. Some common wheat-based items include: breads, pasta, English muffins, wraps, breakfast pastries and cereals.
Gluten is found in many foods outside of wheat-based foods. It can be found in soy sauce, salad dressings, beers, sauces and marinades and candies.

, You may not think that how you eat also affects your symptoms, but large portions of foods and eating very fast are also hidden causes of bloating.When you eat fast, you're not chewing thoroughly. This causes you to swallow large pieces of food. In the process, you also swallow large quantities of air which can get trapped in the stomach or intestines.
Take your time when you're eating and make sure to chew thoroughly. You may want to try to count 20 times before you swallow a bite of food.
Your stomach can hold about six cups of food. If you eat very large portions, it takes an excessively long time for your stomach to digest this food. This leads to an uncomfortable bloating and pressure in your stomach.

, Outside of foods, there are other hidden factors that can cause bloating. If you are overly stressed or anxious, these emotions can cause symptoms of bloating if not managed.


Studies have shown that those people with a psychiatric history experience bloating regardless of dietary changes. In addition, these same studies show that bloating, stress, anxiety and depression frequently present together.Health professionals are unsure of the exact cause or mechanism behind increased stress or anxiety; however, if you feel you're experiencing stress or are anxious, try to manage these issues to help alleviate symptoms of bloating.
Engage in relaxing and self-soothing behaviors like: meditating, exercising, talking to a friend, listening to music or knitting.
If you cannot manage your stress or anxiety alone, consider seeking behavioral therapy for extra help.

, Smoking is a behavior that has been linked to a host of negative health effects. You may not know that it's also been found to be a cause of bloating. If you smoke currently, quit to help relieve your bloating.Part of the reason that cigarette smoking can lead to bloating is that you're inhaling air. You may end up swallowing some of this air as well which can get trapped and make you feel bloated.
Stop smoking immediately. Smoking is not only related to excess bloating, but also to a variety of other serious health conditions.
See your physician for assistance or join a smoking cessation program.

, If you have dentures, you may be surprised to find out that these can cause excess bloating if they don't fit properly.Ill-fitting dentures are typically loose. This makes it more difficult to eat and causes you to swallow excess air. Again, this air can become trapped in your GI tract and cause bloating.


If dentures are not properly cleaned or properly secured in your mouth, the same result can happen as well.
If you don't think your dentures are correct or are not fitting properly, consider going to see your dentist to get them checked over.

, It might be tempting to lay on the couch after dinner; however, if you are in a reclined position after eating, this can lead to bloating and indigestion.Your body is designed to process and digest foods sitting upright. It has an exceptionally difficult time digesting foods if you're lying down or in a reclined position (as in a recliner chair).
Stay upright for at least an hour after eating a meal. If it's a dinner meal, it's typically suggested to wait at least two to three hours before lying down to go to bed.

, A very sneaky cause of bloating could be the vitamin or mineral supplements you're taking. Some can cause bloating and stomach upset.Calcium carbonate is a type of supplement you make take to maintain strong bone health; however, this is hard to digest and can cause bloating. Instead, take a supplement that uses calcium citrate instead.
Another supplement that may be causing some bloating is omega-3 supplements from fish oil. Many women typically experience this and can lessen this effect if the supplement is kept in the refrigerator.
Try taking your supplements with a meal and not on an empty stomach.

, If you experience bloating on a regular basis, you may want to consider tracking your symptoms. There are so many sources and causes of bloating, a journal could help you narrow it down.


The best option is probably a notepad app on your smartphone or using a paper journal.
Track your symptoms and write down when they started, how long they lasted and the intensity.
Include the foods you've eaten, supplements you've taken, drinks you've consumed or if you were overly stressed.
After a few days, review your journal to see if you can pinpoint a trend. Then try to make changes to see if you notice any improvements.

, If you are experiencing bloating and you're unsure of the cause, it's also a good idea to talk to your doctor. Although bloating can be a normal side effect of some things, it could also signal a more serious health concern.


Make an appointment to talk to your physician about your bloating. Make sure to tell them how long this has been going on and what home remedies you've tried.
If you have it, bring along your journal. Even if you can't pinpoint a trend or cause, your doctor may be able to.

, Engaging in regular physical activity is a great way to relieve bloating. It can help prevent bloating but also help alleviate it when you're already experiencing symptoms.A study showed that those people who participated in at least 30 minutes of physical activity three days per week, showed significant improvement in regards to bloating.
In addition, health professionals note that if you do light to moderate intensity exercise right after you eat, this activity can help your GI system pass air through your intestines smoothly.
Try to stay active over the whole week to decrease issues with bloating. Also, plan in a short walk or bike ride after meals to help reduce bloating.

, If lifestyle remedies or dietary changes aren't making much of a difference, you may want to consider taking some over-the-counter medications. These can also help relieve gas and bloating.


If you find that dairy foods trigger your symptoms, you can take a lactase supplement. This helps reduce side effects.
Simethicone is a common anti-gas drug. There are many brands that are available over-the-counter. Regardless of which you choose, this drug can help relieve gas and bloating within 30 minutes.
Always talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medications. They will be able to tell you if they're appropriate or not for you.

If you are currently eating a typical American diet, you're likely eating way too much empty carbohydrate and saturated fat, and not nearly enough quality vegetables, protein or Omega-3 fat, in proportion to the rest of your diet. Understand that if you are chronically vitamin D and Omega 3 deficient, with accompanying low/high/fluctuating blood sugar, fighting ""cravings"" with willpower alone will be difficult.

, Find a ""natural"" food store or buy ""1/4 beefs"" or other proteins from a local, trusted source -- there are ads in your local paper. Look for grass-fed, no growth hormone, etc.


See that a little label~reading will lead you to quality protein, even in a grocery store... How many ingredients are there in your peanut butter? Understand that ""natural"" peanut butter only needs one ingredient, and no added fats, or sugar, just roasted peanuts! By the bottom of one jar of the real thing, your taste buds will have adjusted (to natural), and you will realize that ""choosy moms"" sold you out for profit.

, You may wish to ask your doctor, especially if you are in poor health, and consider making supplementation a permanent part of your diet. The typical American diet has unfortunately lowered the natural intake of Omega3 (the non-inflammatory) in ratio to Omega6 (the inflammatory) from 1:1, to more like 1:10 or 20, or even higher. Your future protein meal used to eat grass, loaded with omega 3 and vitamin D that your body has to have; this is no longer the case if your meat and eggs come from a 'CAFO'.


Although the whole food vitamin will contain Omega~3 in a ""maintenance"" dose, you have almost surely been neglecting this important food for...all your life; good sources like fatty fish, quality proteins (grass fed), eggs (from, yup, grass/range fed chickens), and others, have been degraded by the way in which they are raised -- farmed fish in ponds (force-fed corn), market cattle and chickens (force-fed corn), and loaded with growth hormone, antibiotics, etc. The corn is broken, too; GMOed, mono-cultured, fertilized, pesticided, and processed; then slathered over the entire BigAgro food chain.This is broken food.
Even a generation ago, this article would have been unnecessary, as our grocery store food still contained more whole-nutrition than is the case today.Broken food is no way to eat, and most in U.S. eat this way.RA, diabetes, obesity, colitis, Crohn's disease, poor calcium and cholesterol metabolism, Alzheimer's, formerly 'exotic' cancers and other diseases, and...the list goes on, can be largely or wholly avoided.

,
Vitamin D acts like a hormone in your body! Like Omega~3, insufficient levels in certain organs (not serum levels in your blood, which is all the Dr. can see) affects cholesterol and other metabolisms. A blood test for vitamin D serum levels is now being touted as a better indicator for breast cancer than a mammogram!The best source of Vitamin D is the sun! A fair-skinned woman gets approximately 10,000 i.u. of Vitamin D at about 20 minutes of afternoon exposure (without sunscreen); ruddier or darker skinned people may need a few times that. Supplementation of anything is always a poor second.

, These are your best source of calcium, the most bio-available for humans--well absorbed in a gradual (slow and steady) release. There is much evidence that quality calcium is vital for life -- but also, some calcium forms plaque along with cholesterol on your blood vessel walls. ""Homogenized"" milk and other dairy products are faster released, not slow and steady, and are probably not the best sources of calcium for adults.

, These are a bit more expensive, and the better they are for you, in general, the worse they taste; the payoff is that they will cover a multitude of food sins, allowing for more cheat days and less or no artificial supplements.


Don't worry about the taste of the best quality, powdered ""whole food"" vitamins; shortly after starting on one, your body will crave it, and your taste buds won't be far behind. The best ones aren't necessarily marketed as ""vitamins"" -- they are powdered ""formulas"", or ""compounds"" of multiple plants. For a second tier, less expensive whole food vitamin, choose the tablets.
Even organic food, which many people rely on as being more nutrient-dense, is increasingly being taken over by Big Agri-business, leading to ""beyond organic""... Depleted soil from intensive farming and over-fertilization makes it impossible to get the nutrients your body requires solely from the food grown there.

, These are increasing in number right now as customers come to realize the deficiencies in the food chain, and are a great way to eat more produce grown locally, and organically. The way the food comes (you kind of take what you get, blems, dirt and all) takes a little getting used to -- but this works well for many.

, Milk products, for instance; combine them with lactase (the enzyme that digests milk, which babies normally have in their systems; sold as Lactaid), and avoid entirely, if at all possible, anything labeled ""may cause constipation,"" or lessen the damage of irregularity by adding more roughage.


There is some evidence that ""gluten"", basically ""wheat-glue"" (protein), can cause digestive problems for some; for many, even non-celiacs, there is evidence that it causes a low-level inflammation. You may want to look into this more, especially if you're a bread freak.
An apple a day keeps the Doctor away. These adages don't persist by themselves; the roughage in an apple will keep your digestive tract ""moving"". The accepted wisdom is that you should be moving 3 times daily, at a minimum. If you are only going once daily, you are basically functioning at about 1/3 capacity. Adequate roughage, fruits and veggies with skins, etc., especially eaten with proteins and fats (which alone tend to be ""clogging""), is of great benefit for regularity.
The rise of Crohn's disease, colitis, and other bowel complaints, at younger and younger ages, attests to a lack of roughage in a diet. Eat high fiber foods.

, Get a full printout of this vital information. This can aid you in pinpointing specific foods and supplements that you can benefit from using -- or should be avoided. See 'Discuss' for additional information.

, Understand how processing a carbohydrate can raise it's G.I. precipitously, and how combining carbs healthfully can reduce a meal's overall G.I.- diabetes is an epidemic, often self-inflicted in ignorance.

, You shouldn't be eating for ""comfort"". You may be paying a high price for a very small endorphin release; explore the other ways to release endorphins healthfully, mainly through exercise.
Those people jogging by are not masochists- they have just discovered the body's internal ""cocaine"". Note that jogging is pretty high-impact, and high impact exercises are not recommended for everyone, and especially not for the overweight. You should be eating to maintain your foundation (protein and fats) or to provide fuel for your cells (carbs). You should be able to tell which you are hungry for.

, To the extent that you are unhealthy, it is often because you ignore what your body needs for the sake of convenience or cost. Learning to follow the cues your body gives you, as opposed to the cues your appetite gives you, can result in improved health. Follow other, good for you, best advice about avoiding declining health in your body. This article ignores much for the sake of brevity concerning sleep, exercise, etc.

, Many healthy people fast one day a week, or month. The time chosen here is arbitrary. This is a great way to develop discernment between mind and body cues, as you will be doing something that is good for your body, but your mind will want to fight.


Once your body enters ketosis (fat burning) mode, most of the discomfort will subside -- and, by the way, you can eat protein, and still remain in ketosis, and lose weight. Overweight people (with plenty of fat to burn for fuel) trying this usually report that eating only protein quickly becomes dissatisfying; yet they have plenty of fuel to burn, obviously. This is because your ""habit"" is crying to be fed, and that is all you will be feeding by giving in, and eating a carb. Willpower, along with some Omega 3 and vitamin D, or another fasting regimen, is all that is needed here, but that can be tough at first- redirecting your mind to anything else, and not fixating mentally on your appetite, will help get you through it.
Be aware of the dangers of over-fasting (as if), outlined in the above references.

, You didn't get unhealthy in a day; fortunately, even small steps will yield big results, over time. Progress as you are able, and if possible, enlist a like-minded friend to aid each other's progress. Getting healthy is going to be a journey; and, while you may be groaning at this right now, with just a little positive reinforcement, it will be a largely pleasant one.

, When making diet or lifestyle changes (or any change for the better, for that matter), you are usually altering a comfortable habit of years. Commit to at least two weeks of the new thing before reassessing (it hardly ever takes that long).

, While this may sound trite, your attitude is a choice, and to have a healthy body, you should have a healthy mind without excessive anxiety, anger, depression or mania -- and you need good fuel!


A little premeditated joy in the morning goes a long way. Understand that while in withdrawal from something, your attitude can be harder to control, forcing you to consciously choose a better attitude (joy) more often during the day than will be needed later. Eventually it will become an unconscious behavior; jumping out of bed with the unfeigned, enthusiastic attitude of a child is attainable at virtually any age!

Read food labels.,
Know food label regulations in your country.,
Research your nation’s regulatory agency.",How to Avoid Artificial Food Flavors and Colors1," The ""Nutrition Facts"" label you see on almost every food only includes information about protein, carbohydrates, fat, and vitamin content. It does not include information about food additives. Be sure to inspect the ""Ingredients"" section to look for artificial flavors and colors.


Artificial flavors and colors might also be hidden in the ""Allergy Advice"" label on foods (if this type of labeling is used in your country), so be sure to check that, as well. If the label has an “Allergy Advice” section, then it should be located below the ingredients list. If not, then you might check for a different type of note about any major allergens in the product, such as soy, peanuts, shellfish, etc.;
, The United States requires ingredients like “blue no. 1” to be listed by name on the ingredients list, but in Canada the exact name may not be listed and may only appear as “colour.”You should look up the requirements that food companies must follow in your own country, to be sure you know what to look for.

, In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of regulating food labels and other important food safety elements. In Australia, that agency is Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).Since each country or region is likely to have its own governing body, a good place to start is to find out about yours, look at their website, check for any abbreviations they use that you should look for on labels, and know where to go if you have questions.

Skip ingredients with numbers in the name.,
Recognize alternate names of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) ingredients.As if “blue no.,
Keep an eye out for Tartrazine.",How to Avoid Artificial Food Flavors and Colors2," Most artificial colors are named simply with their color followed by a number. Avoid any product using one of these additives to ensure you don’t get stuck with fake color. Some of the most common are:Red no. 3, red no. 40
Yellow no. 5, yellow no. 6
Citrus red no. 2
Green no. 3
Blue no. 1, blue no. 2

, 2” weren’t tricky enough to spot on an ingredients list, artificial colors may also appear by other chemical names. These may not pop out at you like the word “blue” or “red” on a label will, so be sure to check the ingredients thoroughly. Some aliases of common artificial colors are:


E127 = Red no. 3
E129 = Red no. 40
E102 = Yellow no. 5.
E133 and E132 = artificial blues.
Sunset Yellow FCF is another sneakily named artificial dye.

, Tartrazine, i.e. yellow no. 5 or E102, is a common artificial dye used in many foods. Be on special alert for “tartrazine” in the ingredients list, since it may not stand out without the telltale number attached to it.

Pass on products listing “artificial flavors” or “FD&C” in the ingredients.,
Recognize common names of artificial flavors.,
Avoid MSG.",How to Avoid Artificial Food Flavors and Colors3," No matter how natural a product may look, if it contains anything in the FD&C category or the words “artificial flavors,” it contains unwanted additives.“Artificial flavors” is a generic term to cover hundreds of chemical additives.
Processed and refined foods are the most common culprits containing “artificial flavors,” but they can appear anywhere. Always check labels of food, vitamins, and even medications., Everything from fruit to mint flavor has a manufactured chemical that can reproduce it. When checking ingredient lists, be on the lookout for long, scientific-sounding names. Notice that some chemical names are made to resemble the flavor they are replicating, so don’t be fooled. Some common artificial flavors are:Ethyl maltol (sugar and cotton candy)
Ethyvanillin (vanilla)
Methyl salicylate (mint)
Limonene (orange)
Methyl anthranilate (grape)
Ethyl propionate (various fruits)
Isoamyl acetate (banana)
Cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon)
Benzaldehyde (almond)
Diacetyl (“buttery” flavor), Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is added to foods to enhance their flavor, and is common in many “junk foods” like chips, fast food, canned foods, and in some restaurants, especially Chinese food. Some people choose to avoid MSG, even though it has been through a lengthy testing process and is “generally recognized as safe” by the FDA.You can avoid MSG by asking take-out restaurants if they use it, and if so to leave it out of your food. Get fresh vegetables and market soup instead of canned products. Stay away from fast food chain restaurants. Check food labels for “monosodium glutamate” and other possible terms to describe MSG. Processed free glutamic acid is in many ingredients including:Glutamic Acid
Anything with the word glutamate in it, such as monosodium glutamate, monopotassium glutamate, calcium glutamate, monoammonium glutamate, natrium glutamate
Anything hydrolyzed, such as hydrolyzed protein
Sodium caseinate or calcium caseinate
Yeast food, yeast nutrient, yeast extract, or autolyzed Yeast

Buy organic.,
Cook at home from fresh ingredients.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Ignore the words “all natural.” A product may boast that it is “all natural,” but that has very little meaning.,
Skip deli meats.,
Use natural sweeteners.,
Make your own food coloring.",How to Avoid Artificial Food Flavors and Colors4," The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the use of artificial coloring in foods labeled as “organic.” Organic fruits, vegetables, and meats should not contain fake flavoring, and any color enhancement in organic versions of foods like yogurt or cereal has to come from natural ingredients.Familiarize yourself with food standards in your country so you know what to look for.

, The best part about cooking at home is that you know exactly what you are putting into your meals. If you purchase only fresh, organic ingredients, then you’ll end up with fresh, organic meals free from additives. It may seem daunting to check every label of every food and spice you use, but once you stock your kitchen with natural ingredients this will become second nature.

, “Processed foods” are more than those that are frozen, pre-packaged, or sold in the snack aisle – processed foods are any that have been changed from their original, natural state somehow.Some of the most common processed foods are breakfast cereals, canned vegetables, soda, microwavable meals, potato chips, many meat products like bacon and sausage, and inorganic cheeses.Not all processed foods are unhealthy, but they are more likely to contain additives – you probably can’t avoid processed foods entirely, but pay extra attention to ingredients labels.

, No matter what, check the ingredients list for additives. Don’t let marketing and branding fool you.

, Meats that you can purchase prepackaged from your grocery store, and even many meats that are sliced for you in a grocer’s deli, contain preservatives and possibly artificial colors and flavoring. Steer clear of pre-packaged and cured meats.


Some deli meat companies like Boar’s Head offer low-sodium, gluten-free, and vegetarian-friendly options. Ask your butcher for their preferred, all-natural meat selections. Also consider buying organic chicken, turkey, or ham and cooking and slicing it at home.

, Many people try to prevent diabetes and stay healthy by replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners, but these can be just as unhealthy in different ways.Use natural sweeteners like raw honey, agave nectar, Stevia, maple syrup, blackstrap molasses, and coconut or date sugar.There are many companies, brands, and types of fake sweeteners, so skip the following:


Products like Sunett and Sweet One, which contain ace-K or acesulfame potassium.
Aspartame products like Equal and NutraSweet, and the similar Neotame.
Sweet’N Low, which contains Saccharin.
Sucralose, found in Splenda.

, Most frostings for cakes and pastries contain artificial coloring to achieve their festive appearance. Buy organic frosting or those that use natural dyes, or obtain pure no-additive frosting and make your own food coloring.Pick up some fresh produce to juice or puree, or even spices, to add natural color to your foods:Red and pink: beets, cranberry juice, pomegranate juice, raspberries, strawberries, paprika, roasted red peppers.
Yellow and orange: mango, carrot, turmeric, curry, saffron.
Blue and purple: red grapes, blueberries.

, This recipe uses Hawaiian sea salt at the marinade and the plating stages. It serves two people and uses two tuna nuggets. However, you can adjust the recipe for more people by simply adding more tuna nuggets and making a larger marinade. Start by marinating the tuna nuggets or chopped tuna steaks in a sea salt marinade, and use the following steps to complete the recipe:


To make the marinade, combine 1 teaspoon (5 g) of Hawaiian sea salt with 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) of soy sauce, the juice of half a lemon and the tuna nuggets. Let the tuna nuggets marinade for at least half an hour in the fridge.

Eat an appropriate amount of salt.,
Enjoy sea salt in moderation.,
Use sea salt to cope with asthma.,
Drink sea salt water to improve your digestion.",How to Add Sea Salt to Your Diet3," Your body needs salt in order to regulate fluids and maintain proper muscle and nerve functioning. It is important to get adequate salt in your diet. Sea salt can be a good way of including sodium in your meals.That said, you should consume a moderate amount of salt in your diet. Follow the below recommendations:


Adults should normally limit sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day.If you have high blood pressure, you should limit sodium intake to 1,500 mg per day.If you have heart, liver or kidney problems, you should further limit your intake of sodium. Consult your doctor or dietician to find out how much salt you should consume., Sea salt is much healthier than regular table salt since it contains a variety of trace minerals that your body needs.However, you should enjoy salt in moderation, whether it is table salt or sea salt.

Choose complex carbohydrates.,
Pay attention to your caffeine intake.,
Avoid sugar-free foods.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Eat a healthy diet to avoid sickness.,
Drink more water.,

Monitor your blood sugar while you exercise.,
Have a snack before going to bed.,
Talk with your doctor about medications.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Dress for the weather.,
Get a medical examination.,
Practice stress relaxation techniques.",How to Avoid Blood Sugar Swings," Although all carbohydrates break down into glucose, a simple sugar, complex carbohydrates take longer for your body to process. Choose low-glycemic foods like whole-grains, vegetables, and fruits with the peels. Avoid high-glycemic foods that break down quickly into sugars, causing your blood sugar to spike.Try to avoid potatoes, white rice, sugary drinks, and processed foods usually made with white flour.;
, Some people aren't sensitive to caffeine while others notice a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. Be aware of how your body reacts to caffeine and reduce your intake if you find that your blood sugar spikes.Studies haven't tied caffeine to changes in blood sugar levels. Sensitivity to caffeine seems to be unique to each person.

, While more research is needed to determine the effect artificial sweeteners have on blood sugar levels, artificial sweeteners may disrupt your body's blood sugar balance. Since sugar-free foods still contain carbohydrates that break down into sugars, sugar-free foods can still cause your blood sugar to spike. Try to cut back on artificial sweeteners if you notice you're affected by them.You should also pay attention to how sugar alcohols (like sorbitol and xylitol) affect your blood sugar since these may sometimes convert into sugar.

, Eating just a few big meals during the day can cause your blood sugar to peak immediately after eating and fall if there's a long period of time between meals. Maintain your blood sugar levels by eating several smaller meals throughout the day. Just be sure to cut back on portion sizes.You should also avoid eating high-fat foods since these can elevate your blood sugar levels for a long period of time. Also, avoid eating dried fruits or foods that concentrate sugar into small amounts like dried fruit or fruit leather.

, Although you can't avoid catching a cold or getting the flu, you can try to eat balanced meals. Choose lean proteins, eat more fruits and vegetables, eat low-fat dairy and continue to monitor your blood sugar levels. If you're sick, work with your doctor to adjust any medications you're taking to control blood sugar.When you're sick, your blood sugars can spike since your body's hormones are adjusting to fight the illness.

, You should be drinking at least 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day. If you're experiencing high blood sugar levels, you might need to drink more water to fight your thirst. Try to choose water or beverages that don't contain sugar. For example, avoid sports drinks. While these contain carbohydrates for energy, your body quickly turns them into sugar.In addition to water, you can drink herbal teas or fruit-infused water.

, Don't make big changes to your diet before talking with your doctor. Some diets (like a vegetarian or vegan diet) can lower your blood sugar. If you'd like to choose a vegetarian or vegan diet, make gradual dietary changes. These can help your blood sugar adjust instead of drop quickly.Switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet can actually help your body become more responsive to insulin. This can eventually help your body regulate blood sugar levels more effectively., Your blood sugar levels may drop as you exercise if you're not already in shape. This is because your body uses sugar as fuel during exercise. It's also why people with diabetes are often told to exercise. Track your blood sugar levels while you exercise and avoid extreme exercises that cause rapid swings.Intense exercise can make your blood sugar drop for hours so you should continue to track your blood sugar even after you're done exercising.

, Your blood sugar can drop while you're sleeping. This can make you feel tired or lethargic the next day. If you experience this, snack to keep your blood sugar higher before you go to bed.Choose a snack with complex carbohydrates before you go to sleep. You could eat something like popcorn, a handful of nuts, or a bowl of oatmeal.

, Several prescription medications can cause cause blood sugar swings. If you're on any medications, ask your doctor about taking an alternative medication or a lower dose. Medications that may raise or lower blood sugar levels include:Corticosteroids (like prednisone or hydrocortisone)
Diuretics (water pills)
Antidepressants

, Alcohol contains sugars and carbohydrates that can cause your blood sugar to spike. Once you've finished drinking, your blood sugar could then drop to dangerous levels. To avoid this swinging, try to avoid alcohol as much as possible.If you find it hard to stop drinking alcohol, try to cut back on how much you drink or ask your doctor about resources to quit drinking.

, Changes in temperature can cause rapid rises and falls in your blood sugar. It's a good idea to wear clothing in layers. This way you can add or remove layers to adjust to different temperatures.


If you're having a blood sugar spike, you may feel warmer and want to remove layers.

, While it's normal to feel a bit of a sugar rush after eating dessert, if you think that you're frequently sensitive to sugar highs or lows, talk with your doctor. You may have prediabetes or even undiagnosed diabetes. Your doctor will do blood work to determine if your blood sugar levels are normal or high enough to diagnose diabetes.If you realize that your blood sugar levels change drastically during your menstrual cycle, ask your doctor about using hormone therapy. Regulating your hormones can prevent rapid swings in blood sugars.

, Mental, physical, or emotional stress can make your blood sugar levels rise. As your body tries to deal with the stress, it releases blood sugar to supply energy. Yoga has been shown to help combat stress and lower blood sugar levels. You could also try:Avoiding stressors

Listen to your body.",How to Survive a Fast," Making dramatic changes to your diet can affect your body in big ways. Especially if you have underlying medical conditions that can prove dangerous with fasting — diabetes for example — you should always get a doctor’s approval before undergoing a fast.


Many people fast for religious reasons rather than health, detoxification, or weight loss concerns. Rest assured, though, that most religions that call for fasting, including Islam, Catholicism, and Judaism, allow exemptions for those whose health won’t allow for it.Speak with your religious leader about your doctor’s concerns. Together, you can come up with a plan to practice your spiritual devotion without putting your health at risk.;
, Although the human body can survive for weeks — in one documented case, even months! — without food, it will shut down very quickly without water.Our bodies are about 60% water, and every cell in our body needs it to function properly.Without it, most people will die within three days.Fasting can take many forms, and you might allow yourself to drink water throughout your fast. But some fasts — the Islamic fast for the month of Ramadan, for example — prohibit drinking water for long stretches of time. No matter how much water you allow during the fast, it's important to prepare your body for a long stretch of nutritional deficiency by ""super-hydrating"" beforehand.


Drink plenty of water regularly in the days leading up to your fast. Then, drink at least two quarts of hydrating fluids before the last meal preceding your fast.
Also avoid dehydrating foods with high salt and sugar contents, like fast food or salty snacks.

, Coffee, soda, tea, and all those energy drinks we drink on a daily basis all contain high amounts of caffeine. Though you may not think of it this way, caffeine is considered a mood-altering substance that can result in dependence, if not outright addiction. If you drink caffeine regularly then remove it suddenly from your diet, you will likely experience withdrawal symptoms. When you're eating a normal diet, those symptoms aren't very noticeable. But even a very short fast — a day-long fast before surgery, for example — can worsen withdrawal symptoms.The common symptoms of caffeine withdrawal include headache, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, and trouble concentrating.To avoid these unwanted side-effects, wean yourself off caffeine products in the weeks before you begin your fast.

, If you have an addiction to tobacco products, it may be even harder to give up than caffeine. However, it's even more important to abstain from tobacco use than caffeine use. Not only will tobacco hit you harder on an empty stomach — making your head spin and potentially making you feel nauseous — it poses serious health risks. Tobacco use during a fast elevates both blood pressure and pulse rate, and decreases the skin temperature in your fingers and toes.If you're having trouble finding a way to quit, even temporarily, talk to your doctor to learn more effective strategies.

, The word itself — ""carbo + hydrate"" — essentially means ""watered carbon."" Unlike proteins and fats, carbohydrates bond with water, helping your body stay hydrated for longer periods of time. This is very important when you're preparing to fast! In the days and weeks leading up to your fast, eat plenty carbohydrate-rich foods to help your body hold onto its water:Multi grain breads, pastas, and cereals
Starchy vegetables (potatoes, parsnips)
Vegetables (romaine lettuce, broccoli, asparagus, carrots)
Fruits, (tomatoes, strawberries, apples, berries, oranges, grapes, and bananas)

, You may think that you want to stuff yourself with as much food as possible in the days leading up to the fast. After all, that should help tide you over when you're hungry, right? In fact, stuffing yourself regularly before your fast will acclimate your body to large meals. You'll feel even hungrier when you stop eating. It may also help to vary your mealtimes, so your body doesn't continue to anticipate food at specific times of the day.

, Many people choose to eat a large, protein-filled meal for their last meal before the fast. After days of eating small, carbohydrate-rich meals, this last meal can make you feel more satisfied for a longer period of time and ease you into the fast.


Remember to take in a lot of hydrating fluids before your final meal to help your body get through your fast.

, Hunger is a full-body, primal feeling, and can take over your mind if you let it. Obsessing over your hunger is the quickest way to letting yourself break your fast. Distract yourself by keeping yourself busy whenever possible.


Distract yourself with light, pleasant activities like talking with friends or reading a good book.
You can also take this time to catch up on chores and errands you otherwise put off. When you're trying to keep your mind off hunger, vacuuming the whole house might not seem so bad!
If you're fasting for religious reasons, you might take this time to think about why you're going through this process. Attend religious meetings, study your scripture, and reflect on your relationship with god.

, If you are doing an ""intermittent fast,"" in which you regularly fast every few days for short periods of time, you are most likely trying to lose weight. When you exercise a carbohydrate-depleted body, it begins burning fat to fuel itself, which may be your goal. Note, though, that it will also begin burning through protein and muscle mass. Your best bet is to exercise at a low rate instead of running yourself breathless during cardio.

, People on an intermittent fast only fast for short periods of time. Although they should do less cardio, they can still exercise because they'll refuel their bodies soon. However, if you're planning to fast for a few days or more, it's best not to engage in high-energy activities. They will tire you out far more than they would when you were eating regularly. If you're fasting over a long period of time, rather than intermittently, you won't be able to refuel your body for some time.

, You may feel relaxed while you sleep, but your body is hard at work taking care of itself. When you're knocked out, it gives your body time to repair muscles, form memories, and regulate both growth and appetite through hormones.When you're fasting, you may find it harder to concentrate from the lack of food. Regular naps taken during the day have been shown to improve alertness, refocus the mind, and improve moods.Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, and nap regularly throughout the day.

, Those who are fasting for spiritual reasons will find this easy. You may have friends from your place of worship who are fasting at the same time and for the same reasons. But even if you're fasting for health or detoxification, try to find a friend who will fast with you to keep you company. Being around someone who's going through the same thing will keep you from feeling alone in the experience. Hold each other accountable and motivate each other to reach your goals, whatever they may be.

, Don't put yourself in situations where you'll let yourself feel sorry for yourself. Even if you're around other people who are going through the fast with you, don't let the conversation turn to all the foods you miss eating. You'll obsess over it long after the conversation is over, and you may let yourself cheat when you're alone. Instead of talking about what you're missing out on, frame your conversations around the positives: what are you getting out of this? Or, talk about something completely different, like the movie you just saw or a recent event in the news.


Until your fast is over, politely decline invitations to meals with non-fasting friends. Even if it doesn't tempt you into breaking your fast, watching other people eat will be a miserable experience.

, Even if you have an accountability partner who's helping you stick to your fast, you may find yourself frustrated in ways you don't want to share with others. Keeping a journal to hold your private thoughts is a great way to both vent and record your experience for later insight. You can treat it like a normal diary about day-to-day life or focus it only on fast-related topics. Either way, your fast will likely find its way into your private thoughts.


Don't censor yourself! Even if you're fasting for religious reasons, don't feel bad about questioning whether you want to finish the fast. Just writing it down will help you confront the feeling, then flush it out of your system.

, No matter how hungry you are at the end of your fast, you have to fight the urge to stuff yourself at your first opportunity. When you fast, your body adjusts to make up for the lack of food by slowing down the production of enzymes that help digestion.If you gorge immediately after a fast, your body will be overwhelmed by food it can't process, leading to stomach cramping, nausea, and vomiting.As you draw closer to the end of your fast, you should put together a plan for how to ease yourself back into a regular diet.

, But if you’ve been allowing only water during your fast, juice and fruits, which have high water content, are the best way to ease your body back into a normal diet. Your stomach will have shrunk in size during your fast, so you may even find that juice and fruit can satisfy your hunger at first.

, Stop eating whenever your hunger is satisfied — overeating before your body is ready to handle it can lead to digestive problems. It's best to stick to foods that have a high water content at first:


Soups and broths
Vegetables
Raw fruits
Yogurt

, First, it prevents you from wolfing down your meals. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to process the information it's getting from the stomach and realize that your stomach is full.Eating too quickly leads to overeating, which is dangerous after a fast. The second benefit of thorough chewing is that it breaks the food up into smaller bits that will be easier for your body to digest.


Chew each bite of food about 15 times.
Drink one glass of water before your meal and one glass during your meal to slow down the pace of your meal. Take a small sip between every bite of food.

, Probiotics are “good bacteria” that are found naturally in the mouth, intestines, and vagina.They help your body digest food efficiently, which is something you need help with after a fast. Eat foods that have live cultures of lactobacillus; common sources are yogurts, sauerkraut, and miso.You can also take probiotic supplements in capsule, tablet, or powder form to help your body digest food better.

, No matter what you read about the best way to break a fast, your body will let you know what it's ready for. If, after transitioning from fruits to vegetables, your stomach starts cramping or you feel like throwing up, don't push yourself! Go back to eating fruits and drinking juices for another meal, or even another day. Let your body progress at its own pace. Eventually, you can work back up to harder-to-digest foods and larger meals without feeling any negative side effects.

Eat slightly green bananas.,
Include potatoes and yams.,
Choose whole grains like barley and brown rice.,
Serve yourself some corn.,
Include beans and lentils.,
Include foods fortified with resistant starch.,
Talk to your doctor or registered dietitian.,
Write up a meal plan.,
Stock your refrigerator and pantry.,
Start a food journal.,
Manage your weight with a high resistant starch diet.,
Improve gut health.,
Improve your blood sugar levels.",How to Add Resistant Starch to Your Diet," One common food that has a decent amount of resistant starch is a banana. However, try to eat them when they are just about to be yellow for the highest amount of resistant starch.


Slightly underripe bananas have about 6 g of resistant starch per ""small banana.""A small banana will be about 6-7"" inches in length.
Look for underripe bananas at your local grocery store. These should be fairly easy to find as many stores will put out these slightly green bananas on shelves so they do not get too ripe, too quickly in store.
Use green banana in recipes and meals like: oatmeal or yogurt topped with sliced bananas, a whole banana dipped in peanut butter, a half of a banana dipped in dark chocolate, rolled in nuts and frozen, or just plain by itself. You can even make green banana pasta.;
, Two other foods that contain a high amount of resistant starch are potatoes and yams. Both white potatoes, sweet potatoes or yams contain resistant starch.


Unlike bananas, the amount of resistant starch present in potatoes doesn't rely on the ripeness of the potato. For about 1/2 cup of potatoes or yams, you'll get about 4 g of resistant starch.Consider purchasing whole, raw potatoes and cooking them at home or purchasing plain, 100% sweet potatoes or yams that are canned without seasonings or additives.
Use potatoes in recipes and meals like: simply baked with a pat of butter, sliced and roasted with salt and pepper to make baked fries, cubed and tossed into a potato salad or pureed or mashed into mashed potatoes.

, Whole grains have always been known to be high in fiber. Some, like barley and brown rice are also great sources of resistant starch.


Both barley and brown rice contain about 3 g of resistant starch per 1/2 cup.You can purchase barley or brown rice and cook from scratch or purchase the parboiled or microwaveable versions for quick and easy cooking.
Recipes you can prepare with these grains include: simply steamed with olive oil, salt and pepper, tossed into a salad, baked into casseroles or in tabbouleh.

, This starchy vegetable is another source of resistant starch. Since it's available year round, it's an easy vegetable to include on a regular basis.


For every 1/2 cup of corn, you'll get about 2 g of resistant starch. Although not as high as other foods, corn is an easy food to add to multiple recipes.If it's the season, fresh corn is a great option to increase your intake of resistant starch. If it's out of season, consider using frozen or even canned corn for an extra dose of resistant starch.
Use corn in recipes like: mixed into a homemade corn salsa, tossed into a Mexican taco salad, pureed into a creamy corn chowder, or served plain with a pat of butter.

, The food group that has the highest amount of resistant starch per serving are beans and lentils. Include these foods regularly to help increase your intake of resistant starch.


For every 1/2 cup of beans or lentils, you'll get a whopping 8 g of resistant starch.You can purchase canned, frozen or dried beans and lentils. All will contain resistant starch. Although some varieties of beans may have varying levels of resistant starch, on average they are all fairly high in resistant starch.
Include beans and lentils in dishes like: homemade hummus, serving black beans or refried beans along side tacos, putting beans or lentils on top of a salad, preparing a homemade lentil soup or making homemade red beans and rice (use brown rice for extra resistant starch!).

, There are some foods that are a little bit higher in resistant starch due an ingredient called Hi-Maize. You can also increase the amount of resistant starch in the foods you make from scratch by using Hi-Maize in place of flour.


A food called Hi-Maize which is a brand of corn starch is exceptionally high in resistant starch.If you're making baked goods like homemade bread or muffins you can swap out about one quarter of the flour for Hi-maize to help increase the total resistant starch amount.You can also look for breads, pastas, muffins or other baked goods that use corn starch or Hi-maize in their ingredients.

, Whenever you're making changes to your diet, it's a good idea to make sure that your dietary changes are safe and appropriate for you.


Talking to your doctor about adding in more resistant starch is a good idea. This is especially true if you're trying to better manage your diabetes or weight.
Increasing the amount of resistant starch may change your blood sugar levels and the amount of medication you need to manage them.
It may also be a good idea to speak to a registered dietitian. These nutrition professionals can help you design a meal plan featuring higher amounts of resistant starch foods, give you recipe ideas and help you manage your blood sugars with your diet.

, Whenever you're trying to make changes or additions to your typical eating pattern, it'll be helpful to write up a meal plan to help keep you on track.


A meal plan is just a rough draft of all the meals and snacks that you're planning on preparing and eating throughout the week. It's somewhat like a blueprint of your meals.Write up all the meals for a week - include breakfast, lunch, dinner and any snacks. Look for ways that you can incorporate a serving of resistant starch a few times a day.
For example, if you typically have yogurt for breakfast or an afternoon snack, top it with a slightly green banana. Or if you have a salad with dinner, sprinkle on a few beans for an extra hit of resistant starch.
Use your meal plan to make up a corresponding grocery list. This can help you save money and stay on track while you shop., If you're really interested in bulking up how much resistant starch you eat on a regular basis, it'll be a good idea to get your home stocked with foods that are high in resistant starch.


Use your meal plan and grocery list to help stock your freezer, refrigerator and pantry with items that you can use to make meals that are higher in resistant starch.
Ideas for your freezer include: frozen corn, frozen pre-cooked beans or frozen bananas (freeze before they get too yellow).
Ideas for your pantry include: dried beans and lentils, canned beans and lentils, potatoes and yams (fresh or canned), canned corn, dry barley and brown rice.
Ideas for your refrigerator can include: fresh corn, pre-cooked potatoes and yams, pre-cooked lentils and beans or microwaveable barley or brown rice.

, When you're trying to change your diet, keeping a food journal can help you see if you've been able to make your desired changes.Purchase a food journal or download a food journaling app on your computer or smart phone. Start tracking all meals and snacks that you eat throughout the day.
Since most apps or programs do not count resistant starch in their nutrient tallies, you'll need to do this manually yourself. Overall, it's suggested to aim for about 15-20 g of resistant starch daily.Tally up how much resistant starch you eat at the end of each meal and snack. By the end of the day. Keep track over the week to see how consistent you've been.
Use this information to see if you need to add more foods with resistant starches to your diet, come up with more recipes or be more consistent with your eating plan.

, One benefit associated with resistant starch is decreased hunger, appetite and better control of weight.To increase weight loss while on your resistant starch diet, consider cutting your calories by about 500 daily. This will help you lose about 1-2 pounds per week.However, unlike other low calorie diets, a higher level of resistant starch can help you stay satisfied much longer due to their digestion times.

, Another great benefit of increasing your consumption of resistant starch is improved gut health.Resistant starch acts like prebiotics in your GI system. They serve as a great food source for the healthy microbes that live in your colon. These gut microbes can help prevent constipation and colon cancer.In addition to adding resistant starch to your diet, you can also improve the health of your gut by adding in probiotics. In combination with resistant starch, you can make a big difference in the overall health of your GI system.
You can take probiotics in pill or capsule form in addition to adding foods that are high in probiotics. Choose foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi or tempeh., Lastly, resistant starch is a great additive to your diet if you have diabetes and want to improve blood sugar levels and your blood sugar control.Since resistant starch is resistant to digestion, it does not raise or spike blood sugar levels. In addition, studies have shown that resistant starch can improve insulin resistance.Spread out foods higher in carbohydrates, especially those with resistant starch, throughout the day. This helps your body better regular blood sugar and helps avoid any spikes in sugar.Exercise regularly in addition to adding more resistant starch to your diet. Both aerobic exercise and strength training can help your body better manage blood sugar and insulin levels.For people with diabetes, foods with resistant starches need to be eaten in moderation. The appropriate serving size per meal is about half a cup. Total carbohydrates should not exceed 45 g per meal for most people with diabetes.

, Areas that experience large seasonal changes, like the American Northwest, can also contribute to dry eyes. The chances of your eyes being affected are greater in the dryer winter months. Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do to solve a geographical problem, short of moving. You just need to take extra care to protect your eyes.

, This, in turn, can cause dryness.

, Of the 30 million Americans who have seasonal allergies, 70-80% experience problems with their eyes as a result.Other people may have allergic reactions to pet dander rather than seasonal allergens. However, dryness alone cannot point to allergies as a potential cause. Dry eyes must be paired with itchiness for a diagnosis of allergies. Other eye-related symptoms include:


Prominent blood vessels in the whites of the eyes and the eyelids
Conjunctival chemosis — appears as a blister of sack of fluid on the surface of the eyeSwollen eyelids
A clear, watery discharge
Confirm your diagnosis with a doctor.

, The medications used to treat conditions completely unrelated to your eyes can sometimes still affect your eyes. Give your doctor a complete list of all the medications you're currently taking. Go through them together and ask about whether any of them could be causing your eye dryness.


Acne medications, for example, can sometimes cause sudden dryness. Hypertension medications (such as beta blockers) can also cause dryness.Never stop taking a medication prescribed by your doctor, even if causes dry eye. Instead, ask your doctor what he or she recommends for dealing with this unwanted side effect. They may be able to adjust your treatment options or provide guidance for dealing with the dryness.

, It may be that your dry eyes are a by-product of a chronic underlying condition — like diabetes or hypertension — that requires regular monitoring. For example, dry eyes may result from either the diagnosis or treatment of allergies, depression, acid reflux disease, or chronic pain syndromes.If your general practitioner has no explanation for it, you should see an eye specialist. During the appointment, the specialist will likely:Ask a few questions about your general and eye health-related history
Examine your eyes, as well as the corneas and eyelids
Evaluate your tear production by using dyes to measure tear production

, If your dry eyes are paired with any of the following symptoms, you need to see a medical professional as soon as possible:


Blurred or double vision
Headaches or fever
Nausea or vomiting
Syncope (fainting) or lightheadednessDizziness or excessive drowsiness

, Trial and error is usually the only way to find which brand works best for you, and you might even try the combined use of a few different brands. If you have chronic dry eyes, you should use artificial tears must even when your eyes feel fine.


Only use artificial tears four to five times per day maximum; the preservatives in the tears can cause more irritation if used more often than that. if you need tears more often, consider preservative-free artificial tears.
Artificial tears can only provide supplemental care and are not a substitute for natural tears.
They ease dryness by replacing the layer of tear film that keeps eyes moist and spreads tears evenly over the eye surface.

, It's also available over-the-counter at grocery stores and pharmacies. They're particularly useful during extended periods when artificial tears can't be applied — for example, when you’re sleeping.


Pull down the lower eyelid.
Squeeze a thin layer of ointment into the pouch created between the lid and the eye.
Close the eye for 30-60 seconds to let the ointment soak into the eye.

, People who wear contact lenses should look for drops designed specifically for use with contact lenses. You can also find medicated eye drops that are geared toward specific symptoms, such as itchiness. Demulcent eye drops, for example, target inflammation and irritation.Other common treatments include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and carboxy methylcellulose.Your doctor can also prescribe prescription drops and ointments after examination and diagnosis.


Prescription medications like Restasis (which stimulates more tear production) are generally administered twice daily.Gels are usually administered about one to two times daily.If you are unsure of dosages of your drops, contact your doctor or speak to a pharmacist to clarify the dosage.

, Depending on your doctor's examination and diagnosis, your eyes may need antibiotic treatment. If the dryness is due to diseased meibomian glands (glands that produce lipid layer of tear film) or blepharitis (swelling due to inflammation of lids), ask about antibiotic treatment.This dryness can usually be treated by ointments like tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol.These ointments are applied at night and work to keep eyes moist while you sleep.

, You can reinsert your lenses 30 minutes after treatment.

, Sporadic or improper application of such topical products won't adequately treat the problem. If you don't want to apply treatments directly to the eye, ask your doctor or eye care professional about an oral treatment. For example, if the dryness is due to infection, an antibiotic pill will help relieve dryness.

, Though they will likely cost a bit more, you can use contact lenses that will work better for your needs. Some contacts are more ""breathable"" and cause the eyes to dry out less than other lenses.Other lenses trap moisture in the eye, keeping it moisturized.Talk to your ophthalmologist about his or her recommendations for your options.

, The lacrimal glands produce the watery tear film that moisturizes the eye.A lacrimal plug can be used to stop tears from exiting through tear ducts, allowing more moisture to remain in and lubricate the eye.


This is a more aggressive treatment that should only be considered in severe cases of eye dryness.

, If your doctor finds this to be a cause of your dryness, ask him or her about LipiFlo thermal pulsation, a treatment that helps clear blocked oil glands. This outpatient procedure is noninvasive, and takes only 15 minutes. The doctor will place a device on your eye that sends massaging pulses into it, stimulating tear production. Most people see positive effects within a few days.

, Because our eyes are working whenever we're awake, we may not think of them as something that can get tired, like our legs or arms do. However, our eyes can get strained just like any other part of the body. The most common cause of daily eyestrain is looking at screens. This includes jobs or hobbies that have you stare at computer screens for long periods of time, excessive television viewing, constantly staring at your cell phone, or any other electronic screen use. The eyes are strained especially when you view these screens for extended periods of time and at close distances.


If you use these devices for long periods of time, adhere to the 20-20-20 rule.Every 20 minutes, stop looking at the screen and focus your eyes on something 20 feet (6.1 m) away for 20 seconds.
This helps with dryness and other eye conditions.

, The act of blinking spreads oils and natural lubricants across the eye, moisturizing it. It also clears away debris that can irritate the eye.Normal blinking rates are around 14 blinks per minute but can decrease to 4.5 blinks per minute, especially when you focus on a specific task or stare at an electronic screen.If your eyes feel dry, remind yourself to blink as often as possible to moisturize them.

, They protect your eyes against harmful UV rays, but also against exposure to wind and sun that causes eyes to dry. Furthermore, they can block outdoor debris like dusk and pollen that can irritate the eye.


You should also wear goggles when swimming to protect your eyes from chemicals and irritants in the water.
Avoid exposing the eyes to direct air directly like car heater, hair dryers, and air conditioners.

, Often, environmental conditions can be the cause of dry eyes. Dust and pollen in the air can work their way into your eyes and cause irritations. Using an air purifier can keep the air consistently clean.An air humidifier can help diminish dry eye from dry air by keeping sinus membranes from drying out. The lack of moisture in the air can cause eyes to become dry and irritated.


A humidifier does not necessarily filter or clean the air, but it does create moisture for the air to keep your eyes hydrated.Keep the humidity level in your home between 30-50% humidity.

, Moisturizing with eye drops may temporarily fix dryness, but the underlying problem may be overall dehydration. The Institute of Medicine recommends 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day for men, and 9 cups (2.2 liters) for women.This can help dry eyes by increasing blood circulation as well as eliminating toxins from lymph fluid. It also provides your body with the moisture it needs to increase tear production.

, These vitamins and fatty acids provide eyes with the nutrients they need to stay healthy and well-hydrated. Foods you should look for include:Cold-water fish (sardines, herring, salmon and tuna)
Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
Walnuts
Sweet potatoes
Carrots
Grapefruit
Strawberries
Brussels sprouts
Seeds and nuts
Wheat germ

, Getting a complete rest at night allows your body to restore itself and helps your eyes re-hydrate. When your eyes are closed during sleep, your eyelids replenish your eyeballs with the needed moisture. Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night, with teenagers and children needing slightly more, and senior citizens needing slightly less.Have someone check to see if you keep your eyes partially opened for periods of time when you sleep. This, too, can contribute to dryness., The smoke can also irritate the eyes and dry them out — even among people who are exposed to second-hand smoke. These effects are compounded in people who wear contact lenses.

, Dry eyes can come from too much salt in the diet. You can test this for yourself, especially when getting up at night to use the bathroom. If your eyes feel dry at that point, drink a few ounces of water (small coffee size) and see if your eyes don't feel nearly immediate relief. If they do, then reduce the salt in your diet and stay hydrated.

Purchase the right type of kitchen scale.,
Place a bowl or plate on the scale and zero out its weight.,
Make the most of your scale.",How to Use a Scale1," Most kitchen scales for home use are digital as they are more accurate and easier to use than analog scales.Look for a scale that can switch between measuring units. To give you the most flexibility when preparing food, a good scale should be able to weigh in grams, kilograms, ounces, and pounds.
Also look for a scale with a “tare” function that zeroes out the weight of measuring containers.
Most scales for home use have a capacity between 10 and 12 pounds. Unless you bake in large batches, you probably don’t need a scale that measures beyond that.;
, You should always use the tare/zero function to zero out the weight of the container before you add the food to be measured.


Use the appropriate type of plate or bowl. You might want to use a bowl when using ingredients that will need to be combined, such as when you’re baking, and use a plate when weighing things like meat.
You can also weigh foods directly on the scale. Always wipe off and clean your scale with a hot soapy paper towel before and after weighing, especially if you use it to weigh something like raw meat or poultry.
Zero out the scale after if using multiple ingredients. For example, if you’re baking a cake, add the baking powder, then press the “zero” or “tare” button to reset the scale to zero before adding the flour or other ingredients., Scales are great for a variety of reasons. Make sure you use your scale correctly and read the directions before use.


Liquid ingredients can be measured accurately using a volumetric method (like a measuring cup), but dry ingredients should always be weighed if you want the best control over your results.Control portion sizes with a scale. You can weigh just about any type of food. Make sure to weigh “deceptive” food items (foods that don’t fit well into measuring cups) like dry pasta and breakfast cereal. In addition, stick to the following portion sizes for the food groups: 3-4 oz of protein , 1 oz of grains, 4 oz of fruit or 8 oz of vegetables.Use a scale to divide portions equally. For example, if you’re baking a layer cake, a scale can help you divide the batter evenly between three pans: just zero out the weight of the pan before adding the batter.
If your recipe gives volumetric measurements for dry goods, find a reliable converter to help you determine what they weigh. You can purchase these or find them online."
"
Purchase a quality scale within your budget.,
Place the scale on a hard, flat surface.,
Calibrate the scale.,
Step onto the scale.,
Weigh yourself weekly.,
Use a chart to track your progress.",How to Use a Scale2," There are a variety of bathroom and home scales that you can purchase. Some will be relatively inexpensive, whereas others will cost a significant amount more.


Choose a quality scale that still fits in with your budget. You want a scale that will last for several years and be able to maintain its calibration. In addition, digital scales are thought to be superior to mechanical scales as these are fragile and more inaccurate.Many quality digital scales are accurate within 1 pound anywhere between 97 – 100% of the time. Older-model spring and dial scales may be accurate as little as 13% of the time.You may even want to consider a newer model digital scale that can measure body fat and even track weight loss., When you're weighing yourself, you want to make sure that your results are as accurate as possible. Put your scale on the appropriate surface to help with its accuracy.


Most scales will come with directions that will say where the best place is to put your scale. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's advice.
Placing your scale on carpet can cause the scale to read your weight as 10% heavier!The bathroom or kitchen is usually a good place for an at-home scale.
Make sure the scale is lying level. A scale that tilts or sits unevenly will not read your weight accurately.

, Over time, your scale may lose its accuracy. It's normal after many times of weighing or being moved around. Check it regularly to make sure the results you're receiving are accurate.


Check your scale’s accuracy by putting an item with a reliable known weight (like a dumbbell or a bag of flour or sugar) on it. Check the reading you get and make any adjustments as needed.Refer to your owner’s manual to calibrate your scale regularly.
Many digital scales always have a ""calibration feature"" which can help you accurately calibrate your scale.

, Depending on which scale you purchase or have at home, there might be a slightly different way to step on the scale to get your reading.


With analog scales, you can usually just step on and wait until the dial stops spinning and read your result.
However, if you own a digital scale, you may have to “prime” your scale before hopping on. Some require you to tap it to ""wake it up"" and then step on before it gives you a reading. Always refer to your owner’s manual for proper weighing procedures.

, Research suggests that weighing yourself regularly —at least once a week — may help contribute to weight loss and even long-term weight maintenance.Weigh yourself at the same time every day (preferably in the morning) for the best results. In addition, try to be wearing the same thing whenever you weigh in for an accurate trend.Weigh yourself in the morning for best results. Weigh in after you’ve emptied your bladder and before you’ve had breakfast to eliminate as many variables as possible.There is some disagreement about whether or not it is helpful to weigh yourself daily. New evidence suggests that weighing yourself once daily and at the same time will help you lose weight and/or maintain your weight.If, however, you have a history of disordered eating or find that you are becoming obsessive over your weight, then cut back to only doing it once or twice weekly.

, If you're interested in gaining or losing weight, tracking your weight over time can help you meet your goal.If ink and paper are your thing, you can make a poster to track your numbers or use a paper journal. Otherwise you can use one of the many mobile apps and websites to help you track your weight loss.
Even if you want to maintain your weight, getting on the scale and recording your weight is a good idea. You'll be able to see any unwanted weight gains or losses and be able to change your lifestyle as needed.

Test the scale's accuracy.,
Remove excess clothing.,
Step on the scale.",How to Use a Scale3," Many of those manual scales you might encounter will either be at your doctor's office (where they'll weigh you) or at your local gym.


If you use a scale at your gym, it's very important to make sure the scale is accurate and calibrated correctly. There are most likely dozens of people who step on the scale on a regular basis.
You can use a dumbbell from the gym to help calibrate the scale. Use a 25 pound dumbbell and place it gently on the scale. Move the top and bottom weights so it equals 25 pounds. The needle at the left and right should be floating in the middle of of the little open slot at the ends.
You can also make sure it's calibrated at zero as well. Again, the needles should be floating right in the center of the open slots at the top.If the scale is not calibrated correctly, tell a staff member and have them correct it so you can use it.

, Unless you're at home or at your doctor's office, you don't need to strip down into your underwear to get an accurate weight, especially if you're in a public place; however, taking off shoes, jackets or heavier layers of clothing is appropriate.


Removing as much excess weight as you can can also help you get a more accurate reading for your weight.Remember what you typically weigh yourself in. Try to weigh yourself in the same or close to the same type of clothes each time so you get an accurate trend over time.

, Like a digital or analog scale, you'll need to step on the scale to get your weight.


Sometimes mechanical scales feel a little wiggly when you step on the bottom. Stand as still as you can and balance so that bottom plate is moving around when you weigh yourself.
Slide the large weight along the bottom beam. The large weight has larger scale increments than the small weight (often 10 – 25 pounds).
Then slide the small weight along the top beam. Once you’ve got the large weight in the general vicinity of your weight, use the small weight to zone in on the precise measurement.
Add the top and bottom numbers to get your weight.

Relax your eyes.,
Practice relaxation often.,
Blink more.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Exercise the muscles in your eyes.",How to Avoid Eye Strain1," When your eyes are tired, try relaxation techniques. You can try the practice known as cupping or palming', which are practices that give your eyes time to rest. Sit comfortably in a chair with your back straight. Rub your hands together to make them warm. Put your elbows on table and place your hands over your eyes and close them. Breathe normally and relax with your palms on your eyes for five to 10 minutes.For your first attempt, it is recommended to set an alarm for five to 10 minutes. If after this time you feel refreshed, then this is the correct amount of time. If you don't, add an additional five minutes and observe any changes.
The pressure on your eyes should be light and comfortable.;
, When you stare at close distances for long periods of time, you should follow these stretches of time with eye relaxation techniques. You should also try to frequently increase the distance between you and the object you focus on. If not, you can overly strain the ciliary muscle of your eye, which are the ones that control the lens during the work of eyesight at a distance. You can also make yourself nearsighted, either temporarily or permanently.


The breakdown of the eye muscle changes the ability of your eyes to accommodate and ends up flattening the lenses in your eyes., Blinking provides a break for our eyes, but is often disregarded due to our heavy and long workloads. Blinking lubricates your eyes by spreading your tears evenly along your eyes. It can also help with eyestrain caused by dryness.To help with this, train yourself to blink more often to prevent dryness.Put reminders somewhere near you so you'll be reminded to do this.


Blinking also cleanses your eyes by pushing toxins off them through tears.The best amount of blinking is once every four seconds in order to spread tear film and prevent dryness., Some eye strain occurs because you look at things too long without a break, such as a computer screen or book. Take breaks and sit with your eyes closed for a few seconds to rehydrate your eyes. Try to use the 20-20-20 rule, which means that every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and focus on something else that's 20 feet away.

, To help strengthen your eye muscles, you should exercise the muscles in your eyes. To do this, roll your eyes slowly side to side, up and down, and on the diagonals. Repeat this three to five times.


Perform these exercises a couple of times each day, especially if you are working for long periods of time.

Ease eye shifting.,
Create the best lighting.,
Get the right eyeglasses.",How to Avoid Eye Strain2," If your job requires you to look at multiple things at the same time, you may be causing yourself eye strain by shifting back and forth. This is because constantly shifting eyes means your eyes focus and refocus on different reading materials frequently. To avoid this, purchase a stand for your books and papers so your resources can easily be located and placed next to one another. If you work on a computer as well as with books or papers, put your materials on the stand directly next to the screen, so your eyes won't have to shift as much.


When objects are only a few inches away from each other, your eyes don't need to refocus, which lowers the risk of eye strain.Try learning touch typing, which is typing without looking at the keyboard. This helps reduce eye shifting and can cut down on the time you stare directly at the screen, since you are looking at the papers or book instead. This also keeps you from shifting from your reading source to your computer screen.

, You want to create an environment conducive to what your work is. Use incandescent lighting and avoid high-intensity lamps, which cast shadows and create glares on the material you focus on. Place a dim light on either side of your workstation to create equal brightness without dark, shadowed areas.


If you work on a computer, create an environment that has lighting similar to that of your monitor. You can also purchase an anti-glare screen for your monitor. This will cut the glare if you're not able to eliminate harsh lighting or adjust your monitor.
The ideal work space will have soft lights, limited natural light, no fluorescent lighting, and surfaces that don't reflect too much light.
Switching your bulbs and adjusting your window blinds in your office may cut down on your eyestrain., Having the wrong eyeglasses can contribute to eye strain. Make sure your eyeglasses have the proper prescription. You can check with your eye doctor if you are unsure of your prescription. If you wear bifocals, you might tilt your head at an awkward angle when using your computer. If this is the case, talk to your eye doctor to see if progressive lenses may work better.


Ask your eye doctor about computer glasses if you work on a computer for long hours. They work by reducing the amount of accommodation required by eyes to focus on a computer, which reducing eye strain.Also look into purchasing lenses with an anti-reflective coating, which will help cut down on computer glare. There are also plain, nonprescription lenses with this coating available for those who don't require vision correction.

Position your monitor.,
Adjust the brightness and contrast on your computer screen.,
Clean your screen.,
Upgrade your computer.",How to Avoid Eye Strain3," Eye strain is often caused by staring at a computer for too long. When you work on a computer for long hours, you need to be in the right position from it to reduce eye strain. Try to position your face as far as you possibly can from the monitor. 20 to 40 inches, or 50 to 100 cm, is a good distance because your eyes relax at this distance.


You should also put you screen slightly lower than eye level, with the top of the monitor aligned with your eyes when you look straight ahead. This angle keeps your neck in a more natural position, and ultimately causes less work for eyes.In order to accommodate this, you may a need larger screen or bigger font sizes.
While working with screens and monitors, try slightly closing your eyes or squinting if your eyes feel strained. This prevents your eyes from drying out too quickly.

, In addition to the placement of your screen, adjust your monitor settings for optimal visibility. Use the brightness and contrast controls, as well as color settings, to configure a view that causes the least amount of strain. Start by turning down your screen's brightness and turning up the contrast.


Screens that are too bright are hard on the eyes. When there's not enough contrast between blacks and whites, your eyes have a hard time distinguishing between different items, which adds to eye strain., If you suffer from dry, irritated eyes, you may have dust reaching your eyes because of particles on your computer screen. There are electrostatic particles that may be emitted from the computer screen, which can push dust toward your eyes and cause irritation and strain. To avoid this, wipe down your screen with an anti-static solution sprayed onto a cloth.


Repeat this activity daily, which will also cut down on extra dust as well., If you are suffering from eye strain, buy a high resolution monitor. Older monitors cause your eyes to constantly readjust because they tend to flicker more and have a slower refresh rate. You should also use updated software to automatically change color settings when you work at night, such as the software Flux. Computer screens need to be brighter during the daytime, but this can be too much light for nighttime.


This can cause the screen to look too bright at night, even with the lowest brightness settings.
You can adjust your computer screen manually by changing the settings to what is best suited for viewing in dim lighting or at night."

Recognize symptoms of eye strain.,
Look for severe eye strain.,
Talk to your eye doctor.,
Seek immediate medical attention.",How to Avoid Eye Strain4," Eye strain, or asthenopia, is a common complaint for many people, mainly due to constantly diverting attention at work and at home, especially between laptops, tablets, and phones. There are certain symptoms that are common with eye strain. These may include blurred vision, itchy eyes, twitching eyelids, headache, and sensitivity to light., If you suffer from eye strain for long periods of time, you may develop severe eye strain. The symptoms are similar to normal eye strain, but they are more intense. You may also experience tired feelings in your eyes, sensation of foreign object in your eye, and intense eye pain. If you are suffering from serious or severe eye strain, stop what you are doing immediately and:


Leave any rooms with bright lights
Find a dark room and lie down with your eyes close
Add eye compresses to ease the symptoms, If you try preventative and treatment methods and you still suffer from eye strain, you should talk to your eye doctor. You may need an eye exam to make sure that you are wearing the correct prescription of eyeglasses or if you need to change to bifocals or another type of eyeglass


Problems with eye strain often lead to the diagnosis of persistent migraines, which are a type of severe headache. It can be medically treated and it is important to see what eye issues trigger these migraines so you can prevent them.

, If you experience any eyestrain plus symptoms such as headache, migraine, blurred vision, or nausea, see your eye doctor immediately. If the symptoms are intense or interfere with performing everyday activities, go to your nearest emergency room."

Look for a tender red lump on your eyelid.,
Learn to recognize styes.,
Look for swelling.,
Be aware of other symptoms.",How to Treat a Stye1," Styes are similar to pimples that form on the eyelid. Styes occur when bacteria (usually staphylococcus or “staph” bacteria) that live on the skin’s surface cause infections in or near the eye. You can usually identify a stye from its appearance -- a tender red lump on the eyelid which may develop a small pus-filled center.The stye develops inside the lid and protrudes either outward or inward. External styes involve Zeis or Moll glands and protrude out. Internal styes involve the meibomian gland and tend to protrude inward. An internal stye is just an infected chalazion.;
, Styes can be confused with chalazions, which also appear as a bump near the eye. The treatment of a stye and a chalazion is the same, so it's not a problem if you can't tell them apart.


A stye or hordeolum is caused by bacterial infection. These red lumps are often filled with pus, like a pimple. Styes cause pain and swelling of the eyelid.A chalazion is a cyst or fluid-filled sac that develops in the small oil glands (meibomian glands) near your eyelids. They more often appear at the inner side of the eyelid. Unlike styes, they are painless.Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid. Blepharitis have many causes, including infection, allergies, and untreated chalazions, Blepharitis makes the edges of your eyelids become red and swollen. Your eyelids may be itchy, crusty, or difficult to open., Your eyelid will usually swell up as the stye develops. In some cases the swelling may cause your eyelid to close completely. The swelling will usually last for about three days, after which it will sometimes burst and drain on its own. Occasionally, the inflammation will spread to areas of the face surrounding the eye, in which case you should see a doctor., The swollen eyelid can irritate the eye, causing pain and watering. Your eyes may also be more sensitive to light. The swelling may cause discomfort when you blink."
"
Apply a warm compress.,
Use an over-the-counter treatment.,
Avoid squeezing the stye.,
Stop wearing eye makeup.,
Avoid wearing contact lenses.,
Keep your hands clean.,
Take over-the counter medication for pain relief.,
Give your eyes a break.",How to Treat a Stye2," The recommended home treatment for a stye is to apply a warm compress to the eye for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day.This will increase circulation to the area and speed up the rupture and drainage of the stye. It is important to start warm compress treatment as soon as you identify the stye. Untreated, styes can last for several weeks, but treatment can cut this to just a few days.Always use a warm compress on a closed eyelid. Make sure the compress is not too hot, or you might cause irritation or burns. Test the compress on a clean area of skin such as your arm for a few minutes. If it is too hot, let it cool for a few minutes and test it again before applying it to your face.
To make a warm compress, wet a clean towel with hot (not boiling) water and wring out the excess. Lie down and apply the towel to your closed eyelid for 10 to 15 minutes. Reheat the towel if necessary.
Alternatively, you can wrap a wet towel around a hot water bottle. Lie down and lay the bottle on your face with your eyes closed. This method keeps the towel hot longer.
You can also use a microwaveable heating pack from the back pain aisle of the drug store. Heat it up so that it is warm to the touch but can be comfortably held. If you can't hold it in your hand, it is too hot for your face. These stay warm for about 30 minutes.
Some people prefer to use warm, moist teabags on their eyelids. These are small and hold the heat well, but are no more effective than any damp cloth., There are many creams, ointments and even medicated pads available over-the-counter that will help to clear up the eye infection causing the stye. Look for treatments that contain the ingredient polymyxin B sulfate, which is an effective antibiotic in treating eye infections.Make sure it says that it's safe for use in the eye. Ophthalmologists do not like OTC antibiotics because they are not safe if they get in the eye, which these ointments always do.
Be wary of any product that claims to remove styes immediately or overnight. They are usually expensive and are unlikely to work as quickly as they claim. Stye treatment usually takes between 2-4 days., Although it may be tempting to squeeze the stye or pop it with a needle in an attempt to drain it, never do so. Rupturing the stye can make the infection worse by introducing bacteria from your skin into the stye.Apply a regular hot compress and wait for the stye to rupture and drain on its own.


Attempting to pop or rupture the stye can actually spread the infection from the stye to other parts of your eye., While you are suffering from a stye it is best to steer clear of eye make up such as mascara, eye liner and eye shadow. This will help to avoid irritating your eye and decrease your chances of reinfection.


Since the infection is often present before you are aware of the symptoms, it is best to throw away any eye makeup applicators that you were using when the stye developed. This will help keep you from reinfecting your eye., It is a good idea to hold off on wearing contacts while you're suffering from a stye. This is because contacts could irritate your eye further, causing unnecessary pain. Switch to wearing normal glasses until the stye has cleared.


Wearing contacts that you wore during the period of infection can reinfect your eye. Once your stye has cleared up, wear a new pair of contacts to keep your eyes healthy., Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and hot water before and after touching your eyes. If you touch your eyes with unwashed hands you risk transferring bacteria to the unaffected eye. You might even worsen the initial infection.

, Over-the-counter non-steroidal pain medication, such as NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help to ease inflammation and pain caused by the stye. Always follow package instructions.


If you are sensitive or allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, acetaminophen can help relieve pain caused by the stye. It is not as effective at fighting inflammation as NSAIDs.Always check with your physician or pharmacist to prevent possible interactions with everyday prescriptions.

, It is important that your eyes get adequate rest while you are treating a stye. As you sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines, which help fight infection and inflammation.Get plenty of sleep at night and avoid doing too much reading or other visually-detailed work. Reducing strain on the eyes can help relieve the pain styes cause while you’re awake, such as the pain caused by blinking.


Rest your eyes frequently during work to give them short breaks. Close your eyes for a few minutes and try to relax.
Treat a stye as you would if you were sick with other infections: get plenty of rest, drink lots of clear fluids, and take appropriate pain medications.
Do not “overdose” on vitamin supplements, as this will not increase your immune response. However, taking a daily multivitamin is a good idea for maintaining a healthy immune system."
"
See a doctor if the stye does not improve within two days.,
Get a prescription for antibiotics.,
Have a doctor lance the stye.",How to Treat a Stye3," While full treatment can take up to four days, you should see a doctor if your stye has not begun to improve after 48 hours of treatment.You should see a doctor immediately if you experience changes in your vision. Also seek immediate medical help if you experience any change in the amount or type of discharge from your eye., The doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic, such as an ointment or eye drops, to clear up the infection. The doctor may also opt to prescribe oral antibiotics, especially when the styes are recurring., If the stye has not cleared up after several days and shows no signs of rupturing on its own, a doctor may lance the stye. Lancing allows the stye to drain. This will usually be done with a local anesthetic in the doctor's office.If the stye is affecting a baby or small child, the lancing may be done under general anesthetic.Always let a trained medical professional lance styes. The eye is a very delicate area. Attempts to lance or puncture a stye on your own could cause infection or permanent damage to your eye."

Minimize contact with your eyes.,
Be careful with eye make up.,
Clean makeup tools regularly.,
Protect your eyes from dust and other debris.,
Scrub your eyelids.,
Consider whether you might be more susceptible to developing a stye.",How to Treat a Stye4," Bacteria, especially staphylococcus or “staph” bacteria, are often the culprit behind styes.Rubbing your eyes can cause irritation and can transfer bacteria from your hands to your eyes.


If you absolutely have to touch your eyes, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with an anti-bacterial soap first.

, Old or expired makeup, especially liquid-based makeup, can be a breeding ground for bacteria. Avoid sharing eye makeup or tools with others. Always remove eye makeup before going to sleep at night.


Replace mascara and liquid eyeliners every 2-3 months.Foundation can also support the growth of bacteria, including staphylococcus, one of the culprits that causes styes. Replace liquid foundation every 6-12 months., Clean your makeup tools and applicators after every few uses to keep germs away. Tools like eyelash curlers and eyeshadow brushes should be cleaned and disinfected regularly.Wash metal tools such as eyelash curlers and tweezers with antibacterial soap and hot water. Wipe them down with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol to disinfect.
Rinse brushes with baby shampoo and warm water. Disinfect them by soaking them in a solution of 2 parts water and 1 part white vinegar.
Do not pump your mascara wand in and out of the bottle. Rinse your mascara wand in eye makeup cleaner and allow it to dry before putting it back in the bottle., Dirt and small objects can get trapped beneath the eyelid and cause infection. Protect your eyes whenever necessary by wearing safety goggles or sunglasses.For example, you should protect your eyes when you are dusting. Wear eye protection when doing outside work, such as raking or mowing the lawn, or when doing shop work at home.
If you are in a job that requires safety glasses, wear them! Eye injuries are a leading cause of workplace injury., Some people have higher levels of oil build-up on their eyelids. This makes them more prone to styes. Regular lid scrubs can help prevent styes by removing excess bacteria and dead skin cells. They can also help reduce reinfection if you’ve already had a stye.Make your own scrub solution with baby shampoo and warm water. Put a few drops of baby shampoo into a small cup and add warm water. Stir. Use a cotton swab or clean washcloth to rub the solution across your eyelids. Gently rub back and forth, as it is the rubbing motion that removes buildup.
Commercial lid scrubs are available at most drug stores. Find one that will not irritate your eyes., Although styes are very common and they can affect anyone, there are certain conditions which might make you more susceptible to getting one:People with chronic conditions such as diabetes, seborrhea and blepharitis are more likely to develop styes, along with people with chronic debilitating diseases.
People who have acne, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis are more likely to experience meibomian gland dysfunction, which can cause chalazions to develop.People with high levels of blood lipids are at increased risk. Their oil glands are more likely to become blocked, which can cause styes.People with high levels of stress may be more likely to develop styes."

Always read the label.,
Inspect the eye drops bottle and contents properly.,
Practice good hygiene.,
For contact lens users, remove them prior to use.,
Remove the cap.,
Tilt your head back and look up towards the ceiling.,
Gently squeeze the eye drop bottle over your eye with your dominant hand.,
Let go of your lower eyelid.,
Close your eyes for 5 minutes and resist blinking.,
Return the cap and seal the eye drop tightly.,
Handle any accidents calmly.,
Know the various types of eye drops.,
Know when eye drops are useful.,
Know why eye drops are effective.",How to Administer Eye Drops," Not all eye drops are manufactured the same. Manufacturers will specify safety tips and requirements for their product. Check the label for:



Expiration date. Never use eye drops beyond the expiration date. Expired eye drops can irritate your eyes and cause infection or changes in vision.

Storage instructions. Generally, eye drops should be stored in a cool, dry place where they are not exposed to sunlight. Follow the required temperature and storage instructions for your eye drops. Never store the eye drops in a freezer.

For those who live in the tropics, it is advisable to store eye drops in the refrigerator unless it is not allowed as specified in the label. This comes with a bonus! Cold eye drops provide a more soothing and refreshing effect when applied.

;
, Double check the consistency of the eye drops. Discard the eye drops if they look suspicious, have turned cloudy, or have changed color.


Verify that the dropper tip is not cracked or chipped. Damaged dropper tips will cause injury if it accidentally comes in contact with the eyes. It may also dispense micro fragments that could irritate the eye.This solution should be isotone and isohydric with the lacrimal fluid. If this condition is not met, the eye will be irritated and this can lead to corneal alterations, blurry vision or even permanent eye damage. These means that the eye-drops must have similar physic-chemical characteristics with the lacrimal fluid's characteristics.
As a general rule when it comes to eye drops: Discard when in doubt.

, Always wash your hands before applying eye drops. Dirty hands may contaminate the eye drops or the eye itself with contact. Hand washing is your best defense against germs. Always use soap and water. To wash your hands effectively:Work the soap into a lather on hands, wrists, and skin just before the forearm.
Rub the palms against each other and then with the fingers interlaced.
Overlap the right palm on the back of the left hand with the fingers interlaced. Repeat with left palm over the back of the right hand.
Rub the back of the fingers against the opposing palms in a twisting motion while the tip and half of the fingers are interlocked.
Cup the right hand and rub it in a circular way against the left palm for at least 5 times. Do the same with the left hand.
Enclose and rub each finger (one by one) of the left hand with your right hand in a gentle, milking manner. Repeat for the right hand.
The duration of hand washing should be equivalent to at least 2 full “happy birthday” songs.
Rinse thoroughly with water and dry with a clean towel.

, Contact lens are a barrier to proper absorption of eye drops. Place them in your solution in their container and replace them when the eye drops have fully infused into your eyes.


It's best to wait for 15 minutes before wearing them again. The contact lens may cause irritation or inhibit eye drop absorption if applied immediately.

, Place the cap sideways on a flat surface or hold it with a clean hand. This avoids contamination of the cap with germs.


Never place the cap on a surface with the tip pointing up. This exposes the inside of the cap with potential harmful bacteria.
Avoid hand, finger, or skin contact with the dropper tip. This prevents bacteria from polluting the eye drops content and dropper tip.
The drops must be sterile. This means that they must not have been in contact with anything before putting them inside your conjunctival sac (tear duct). This is very important because the eye is a very sensitive organ where an infection can develop quickly, leading to serious damage.

, Tilting the head back prevents the eye drops from spilling out. Pull down the lower lid of your eye with the index finger of the non-dominant hand to form a v-pocket in the lower eyelid. The v-pocket is the area that accommodates the eye drop.


Hold the eye drop (with the tip pointing down) with your dominant hand. The dropper tip should always be a few centimeters away from the eye.
Looking up will prevent excessive movement of the eyeball, which could cause leakage of eye drops.
The dominant hand is more stable in holding the eye drop bottle. You will also find it easier to squeeze the eye drop bottle with your dominant hand.

, Make sure only a single drop enters the v-pocket. Be sure not to touch your eye; the dropper tip may injure the eye if it comes into contact with the eye’s surface.


Multiple drops are not advisable because the second drop almost always is wasted as it spills into the skin. Moreover, there will be poor absorption with multiple drops.

, This will seal the v-pocket the drops went into. Close your eyelid and gently dab excess fluid with tissue. Do not use your hands to dab excess fluid as doing so may induce infection or irritation.


A clean towel will also work, but a tissue will be easier to use and is likely more hygienic.

, Gently press the index finger against the round-shaped sac (your tear duct) in the inner corner of the eye. This can be located at the junction of the eye and bridge of the nose.


It takes 5 minutes to facilitate proper absorption of a single eye drop. Blinking may wring out the medicine away from the eye into the skin of the lower eyelids.Pressing against the round-shaped sac gently will close the connection between the eyes and the nose. This ensures that the drop will not be wasted by draining into the nose.
If more than one drop is necessary, you can apply the next drop after 5 minutes elapses. This is especially important if you're using more than one type of eye drop as they should not be mixed., Repeat for the other eye if necessary. Store it in its proper storage place after use. Wash your hands immediately after eye drop application to remove medication from the hands.


When you're finished, perform the hand washing technique described above.
If you are using an eye drop and an ointment, apply the ointment second. The oil in the ointment solution will trap the eye drop and reduce its effectiveness and absorption.

, If you are not very careful and a larger quantity of drops than required touches your eye, you should immediately wash it with water. No harm will be done. Keep the following protocol in mind:


If you touch your cornea, you should immediately consult an ophthalmologist because it increases the risk of complications like an infection.
If you touch the eye-dropper, you should change it with a new one to limit the risk of getting an infection.
If your vision is very blurry after you use the drug prescribed for the first time, you should call your doctor and tell him this. You might be allergic to that substance.
If your eye function does not improve after a few days, call your ophthalmologist. He might suggest a change in your treatment.

, Eye drops are drugs designed for local or topical use, just for the eye. They can be solutions (liquids that contain at least two soluble substances), suspensions (liquids that contain particles in a solvent, that are not dissolving) or emulsions (liquids in which we have at least two non-miscible components).

They are mostly prescribed by your general practitioner or ophthalmologist after a thorough clinical exam; despite this, some of these drugs can be procured very easily from a pharmacy without a doctor's prescription (they are called OTCs - Over-The-Counter drugs). They are available for the most common ophthalmic affections, like allergies, conjunctivitis and so on.

, There are a number of different reasons a person may need eye drops. Here are some of the most common issues:

For treating different conditions such as conjunctivitis, or pink eye. They can contain antibiotics, NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs) that fight inflammation found in this infections.
For diagnosing ophthalmic problems. It is known that before an ophthalmological exam, the doctor might put some eye-drops in your conjunctival sac for a better view of some components of the eye. There are drugs that can cause an increase in the diameter of the pupil (mydriatic drops, like Homatropine) or decrease the pupil diameter (miotic drugs, like Pilocarpine).
Another common way eye drops are used for is lubricating contact lenses and avoiding eye irritation.

, This type of administration is very useful when a local effect on the eye is needed, not a systemic effect. Using these, you can get a smaller concentration of the main active substance and obtain a high local concentration within the eye tissue; this is one of the greatest advantages of this form of administration. In other words, eye drops get right to the source.

Another very important quality of this type of drug is that they institute their effect very quickly due to excellent absorption rates; this appears because the eye is an organ that has a rich lymphatic capillary network which communicates on the whole surface of the eye.

, Avoid wearing contact lenses for more than 19 hours. Wearing contact lenses for too long can cause permanent vision damage as well as extreme discomfort to your eyes.Never sleep with your contact lenses in unless your doctor specifically instructs you to do so. Your eyes need regular supplies of oxygen, and lenses block the flow of oxygen to the eyes, especially during sleep, so doctors recommend a normal break from wearing contact lenses for your eyes during the night.Do not swim while wearing contact lenses unless you are wearing tight fitting swimming goggles. It's better to use prescription goggles if needed. It is fine to wear contacts in the shower providing you keep your eyes closed when you are likely to get soap or shampoo in your eyes.
Follow the instructions from the manufacturer and your eye care practitioner about using the contact lenses and the solutions. One of the most important caveats is to wash your hands before handling your contact lenses.

, Always take time to remove your eye makeup before you go to bed. Never go to bed with your eye makeup still on. If you go to bed with mascara or eyeliner on, it can get into your eyes and cause irritation.


Sleeping in your eye makeup can also cause the pores around your eyes to become clogged, which can lead to styes or (hordeolum) . A severe sty can require antibiotics or even need to be removed by a doctor.Keep makeup remover pads near your bed for times when you are too tired to go through your nighttime cleansing routine.

, Using an allergen-reducing eye drop during allergy season may help 'get the red out' and sooth itchiness, but daily use can actually make the problem worse. It can cause something called rebound redness, which results in excessive eye redness because eyes no longer respond to eye drops.Allergen-reducing eye drops work by constricting the blood flow to the cornea, which deprives it of oxygen. So while your eyes don't feel inflamed and itchy anymore, they're actually not getting enough oxygen from blood. That's not ideal, because the eye muscles and tissues need oxygen to function. The lack of oxygen can even result in swelling and scarring.Read the labels of eye drops carefully, especially if you wear contacts. Many eye drops cannot be used while wearing contacts. Ask your eye care practitioner what kind of eye drops are okay to use with contacts.

Look for sunglasses that have a sticker that specifies that the lenses block 99% or 100% of UVB and UVA rays.Prolonged exposure to UV rays can harm your eyesight, protection in youth can help prevent loss of eyesight in later years. Exposure to UV rays has been linked to cataracts, macular degeneration, pinguecula and pterygium, harmful conditions for the eyes.Since the damage to eyes from UV rays builds up over a lifetime, it's important to shield children from harmful rays. Make sure your children wear hats and protective glasses when they are out in the sunlight for prolonged periods.
Be sure to wear sunglasses even if you're in the shade. Even though shade lessens UV and HEV exposure significantly, you're still exposing your eyes to UV rays reflected off of buildings and other structures.
Never stare directly into the sun even if you are wearing UV sunglasses. The sun’s rays are very powerful and can damage the sensitive parts of the retina if exposed to full sunlight.

, Be sure to wear goggles or other eye protective wear when working with chemicals, power tools, or any place with harmful airborne particulates. Wearing goggles will help protect your eyes from any large or small objects that might hit you in the eye and cause damage.

If you need to use artificial tears more than four times per day, look for preservative-free artificial tears or speak with a doctor.Trial and error is usually the only way to find the best brand of artificial tears for your particular dry eyes. In some cases, a combination of a few brands may be even be necessary. They are available over the counter and are available in a wide assortment of brands.

, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is the most commonly used medication for dry, irritated eyes followed by Carboxy Methylcellulose. These are also used as lubricants in tear drops and can be found in many over the counter drops.You might also look for antibiotic eye ointment like tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol. These are useful if you have eyelid swelling.

, If you've tried eye drops and prescription drops, but still have severe dry eyes, see your eye doctor. Once the doctor has determined the cause of your dry eyes, you'll have other treatment options available to you.


If you're experiencing pain, like itching, burning, or blurred vision, see your eye doctor., Your doctor may prescribe an eye ointment. Unlike artificial tears which treat symptoms of dry eyes, ointments are medicated to treat the cause of your dry eyes.


Eye ointments can also comfort because of their lubricating effect. They're useful during extended periods when artificial tears can't be applied. (While sleeping, for example.)

, You may need a more permanent or aggressive treatment. Your doctor may suggest inserting plugs into your tear ducts. These block tear drainage so your eyes remain lubricated.These plugs conserve your tears, as well as any artificial tears you use., If you've had your tear ducts plugged, but are still dealing with aggressive dry eyes, your doctor may suggest cauterizing the tear ducts. Once your doctor approves this surgery, an eye care professional will exam you and perform the surgery.


Understand that your tear ducts may actually heal over time. You'd need to have the surgery or another kind done to treat your eyes again. Cauterizing your tear ducts is a reversible surgery., Even when reading, it is important to take breaks. When we stare at a screen or a book, we don’t blink often enough., Dry eyes cannot be completely cured, but there are some methods of prevention that can help along with your treatment. Just like any liquid, tears also evaporate when exposed to air. To keep your eyes moisturized:Don't expose your eyes directly to air (like car heaters, hair dryers, steam and air conditioners)
Keep the humidity level in your home between 30-50% humidity.
Use a humidifier during winter to add moisture to dry indoor air

, Wear sunglasses when going out in the sun. Wear goggles if you plan on swimming. You can also get special glasses from your eye doctor. These glasses create extra humidity by forming a moisture chamber around your eyes.

, Avoid smoking since it can quickly deplete tears and cause many other potential health problems. Also, avoid rubbing your eyes. This prevents bacteria spreading from fingers and nails onto your eyes.

, Some medications, such as diuretics, antidepressants, beta blockers, Parkinson treatments, can cause dry eye. If you are on these medications and having problems with dry eye, it should be discussed with your primary physician. You may wish to change the medication to something with fewer side effects.

, People who wear contact lenses and suffer from dry eyes should ensure that the fit, function and material of the contact lens is appropriate for their eye. You should see your ophthalmologist for help with fitting and choosing an appropriate lens.

, Use artificial tears as eye drops to keep your eyes lubricated and moisturized. You can also use ointments which last longer than eye drops. However, they can be messy because of their viscous nature and can lead to blurred vision. You might only want to use them while you sleep.


Use eye drops before, rather than after, performing visually demanding activities to prevent dry eyes. Try to blink often. This will help spread the tears or drops evenly.

, Dry eyes can come from too much salt in the diet or lack of vitamins. You can test this for yourself, especially when getting up at night to use the bathroom. If your eyes are dry, drink around 12 ounces of water. See if your eyes get immediate relief. If they do, then reduce the salt in your diet and stay hydrated.


Try increasing the fatty acids in your diet. Specifically, add omega-3s to your diet. This can alleviate dry eyes by boosting your tear production.Ensure that you are eating adequate Vitamin A, which can be achieved by eating plant foods such as vegetables and fruits. Vitamin A deficiency is rare in the Western world, but can be aggravated by a diet deficient in whole fruits and vegetables.

Ensure you are the proper distance from the screen.,
Use a wireless mouse.",How to Take a Vision Test Online1," In order to find a vision test online, you will need to complete a Google search. Search for “online vision test” and look through the results. The majority of vision tests available online are provided by companies that sell contact lenses and eye glass frames.


In some cases you will be asked to create an account or provide your email address prior to taking an online vision test.;
, There are a variety of different vision tests available online. For example, you can test your colour vision, visual acuity, light sensitivity, near vision, as well as test for astigmatism. If you are having trouble reading or seeing images on the television, you should test your visual acuity, light sensitivity and near vision. If you are concerned that you may have some form of colourblindness, you should test your colour vision. Determine which test makes sense for your particular situation., Once you have decided on a test you will need to read and follow all of the setup instructions provided. For example, the test will likely ask you to sit anywhere from 40 centimeters (16 inches) to one meter (three feet) from the computer screen.


Situate your computer on your desk and then move your chair so that you are the appropriate distance from the screen.
You can measure the distance using measuring tape or a ruler.

, You will also be required to click on certain images while taking the test, so it is probably best to use a wireless mouse. You can purchase a wireless mouse at any computer supply store and they cost anywhere from $40 to $500."

Start with hard blinking.,
Relax your eyes with an eye massage.,
Blink for thirty seconds.,
Close your eyelids halfway down.,
Exercise eyes with eye squeezing.,
Give yourself an acupressure massage.,
Try eye hydrotherapy techniques.",How to Stop Eye Twitching1," Shut your eyes as tight as you can. Then open them up as wide as possible. Continue this type of blinking until your eyes begin producing tears. Stop immediately if you experience pain or if the twitching becomes significantly worse.


Doing this in quick succession spreads tear film evenly. This will cause relief by hydrating the eye, resting the lid, stretching the eye and facial muscles, and increasing eye circulation.;
, Lightly massage your bottom eyelids in a circular motion using your middle fingers. Massage the lid of the twitching eye for approximately thirty seconds. To prevent irritation or infection, be sure your hands and face are clean first.This method has shown results with increasing circulation as well as stimulating and strengthening muscles., Try to do this with adequate speed. You should also make the movements very light. Imagine that your eyelashes are butterfly wings. The process of blinking is extremely important to your eyes. It relaxes most of the eye muscles, as well as lubricating and cleansing the eyeballs, which can stop the twitching.Stop immediately if you experience pain or if the twitching becomes significantly worse.

, You will notice that your upper eyelids constantly tremble with different amplitude. Concentrate your efforts on stopping this trembling.


By squinting and helping visual acuity, you place less strain on the eyes. This may help a twitch resulting from a tired eye., Close your eyes for one full minute. During this time, squeeze your eyes shut more tightly then release without actually opening them. Perform three repetitions before opening your eyes.


This exercise can lubricate eyes by increasing tear production. In addition to helping with twitching, you can use the exercise to keep eye muscles strong., Use the above image to locate the acupressure points around your eye. Massage each point lightly in a circular motion for 5-10 seconds before moving to the next. Once you finish the sequence, start again from the beginning. Repeat for approximately two minutes.For a similar acupressure technique, place your index and middle fingers on your eyebrows. Press gently and rotate them on the edges of your eye socket bone for five minutes.Acupressure methods help eye twitching by increasing circulation to the eye while the closed lid allows tear film to hydrate the eye.
To prevent irritation or infection, ensure your hands and face are clean first.

, Alternate between splashing your closed eyes with cold and then warm water. The cold water will constrict blood vessels, and the warm water will dilate the same vessels.This process will help increase circulation and blood flow to the eye, which can help with twitching.


You can also run a wet ice cube over the eyelid before splashing with warm water as opposed to alternating between warm and cold water. Repeat the process 7-8 times.

Follow the instructions.,
Test your visual acuity.,
Take a contrast vision test.,
Try a colour vision test.,
Take a test that measures astigmatism.,
Read your results.",How to Take a Vision Test Online2," It is important that you carefully follow all of the instructions provided in order to receive accurate results. For example, during the test you will likely be asked to cover one of your eyes with your hand and then answer a variety of questions. You will then be asked to cover your other eye and answer another set of questions. This is done in order to test the vision in each of your eyes.You may be asked to leave your glasses on if you already wear glasses to help with your vision.

, When taking a visual acuity test, an ""E"" will appear on your screen and you will be asked to select the arrow that the open side of the ""E"" is facing. The ""E"" will rotate and change sizes as you complete the test.Depending on the website you are using you may be asked to cover one eye and take the test and then repeat the questions with your other eye covered.

, An online vision test that looks at your ability to see contrast can also help determine if you need corrective lenses. To complete this test, a ""C"" will appear on your screen and you will be asked to select the arrow that the open side of the ""C"" is facing. As you complete the test the ""C"" will rotate and the darkness of the letter will change.For example, in some instances the letter will be very dark and easy to read and at other points it will be so light that it will become difficult to see against the white background.

, A colour vision test will check to see if you can distinguish different colour contrasts, most notably red, green, and blue. These tests vary slightly, but in most cases a circle will appear that is filled with different coloured circles. You will then be asked to read the number that is hidden inside the circle. If you are not colour blind you should be able to see the numbers easily based on the contrasting colours., An online astigmatism test will ask you to cover one eye and look at a series of lines. You will be asked if some of the lines appear darker than others. Then you will then be asked to cover your other eye and determine if some of the lines are darker than others.You should only see darker colours with one of your eyes, not both. If this happens you may have astigmatism and should talk with your eye doctor.

, At the end of each test you will be given your results. You may receive excellent results for each test. This indicates that your vision is good and you likely do not need glasses. For some tests, you may receive a poor result. When this happens the site will recommend that you see an eye care professional in order to receive a full eye exam.Some sites will only provide you with results after you have provided your email address and name.

Find an optometrist or opthamologist.,
Visit your eye doctor regularly.,
Complete a full eye exam.",How to Take a Vision Test Online3," Search online for an optometrist or opthamologist in your area. An optometrist is trained to detect a number of eye diseases and can help prescribe corrective lenses. An ophthalmologist can perform eye surgery as well as detect eye diseases, prescribe medication, and prescribe corrective lenses., Do not replace regular visits to the optometrist with online vision tests. These tests should only be used to give you a general understanding of your quality of vision. A trained optometrist can give you a prescription for corrective lenses and can diagnose eye diseases such as glaucoma and cataracts.School aged children should have their eyes tested every one to two years.
Adults between the ages of 20 and 40 should have their eyes tested once every five to ten years.
Adults between the ages of 40 and 55 should have their eyes tested every two to four years.
Adults between the ages of 55 and 65 should have their eyes tested every one to three years.
Adults over the age of 65 should have their eyes tested every 1-2 years.

, An eye examination, unlike an online vision tests, looks at more than just your vision. For instance an eye exam also evaluates your ocular motility, visual fields, eye structure, and screens for eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration."

Limit caffeine and other stimulant intake.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get more sleep.,
See an eye doctor.,
Discuss supplements.,
Discuss treatment options.",How to Stop Eye Twitching2," Too much coffee, soda, or even stimulant medications can lead to eye twitching.Try cutting back on your intake. Consult with your doctor first before altering your dose of any prescribed medications, though.

, Dehydration can cause eye twitching. Try increasing your water intake. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water per day.

, General fatigue can lead to dry, tired eyes and result in more occurrences of eye twitching.Try to get a full 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Also, limit your use of electronic screens such as TVs, mobile devices, and computer screens leading up to bedtime.

, Any of the following symptoms may indicate a more serious condition and warrant a trip to an eye specialist:Twitching that persists for more than one week
Twitching that completely closes an eyelid
Spasms that involve other facial muscles
Redness, swelling, or discharge from an eye
A drooping upper eyelid
Accompanying headache or double vision
If your doctor suspects that a brain or nerve disorder is responsible for eye twitching (such as Parkinson's disease or Tourette syndrome), he or she will examine you for other common signs. The eye doctor may refer you to a neurologist or other specialist.
Make sure you discuss your current supplements, medications, exercise routine, and diet with your doctor when you go.

, Your doctor may run tests to measure your vitamin, mineral, and electrolyte levels since certain deficiencies (such as calcium) can cause eye twitching. Based on the test results, your doctor may prescribe something as simple as an over-the-counter supplement.

, If you experience chronic, benign eye twitching, your doctor may discuss several treatment options. Botulinum toxin (Botox™ or Xeomin) is the most commonly recommended treatment.For mild cases, your doctor may also recommend medications such as Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Trihexyphenidyl, or another muscle relaxant.If other treatment options fail, your doctor may discuss surgical options as well. Around 75-85% of patients who experience benign eye twitching benefit from myectomy. For this procedure, a surgeon removes some of the muscles and nerves in the affected eyelids.However, this is not a common treatment, as botulinum toxin injections are usually sufficient.

Consider your medications.",How to See in the Dark," Your rod cells take about 30 to 45 minutes to adapt to a change of light around you. Rod cells can only see black and white and have poor resolution but are very sensitive in night vision circumstances.


Photopigments are chemicals contained in both rod and cone cells that are light-sensitive and convert what you see into a language that your brain can understand. Rhodopsin is a photopigment found in rod cells that is critical to night vision.
Your ability to adapt to darkness depends on some things that may be out of your control, such as your age, previous eye injury or damage, and any existing eye conditions.
In order to see in the darkness, you need to understand what it takes to improve your utilisation of the rod cells and manipulate your eyes to more quickly adapt to a sudden change in light.
If you are trying to look at a dim light, don't look directly at it. By doing this, you are utilising your rod cells instead of your cone cells which would happen if you look directly at the dim light. This trick is often used by astronomers.;
, Rod cells don't pick up the color red, so 20–30 minutes of wearing red tinted glasses before you go into a dark area can help you to detect motion around you more quickly.By blocking everything in the visible spectrum except red, the glasses will allow your rods to adjust to “darkness” of a sort before you head out.
This is a common trick that aviators use when they don’t have time to sit in perfect darkness and adjust before night-flying.

, Light sources will force your pupils to contract and diminish your night vision.The pupil works like the aperture part of a camera, getting smaller or larger depending on the amount of light that is entering the eye. The more light, the smaller the pupil gets. In lower light situations, your pupil opens wide to let in as much light as possible.
By looking directly into a light source, you are extending the amount of time it will take for your vision to adjust, or readjust, to the low light.
If you can’t avoid looking at a light source, cover or close one eye, or safely divert your gaze, until it passes.

, Take steps before you get in the car to help enhance your vision as you drive at night.As just mentioned, try to avoid looking directly at an oncoming light source. If someone comes around the bend with their high-beams on, protecting one eye will prevent you from getting “flash blindness” in both eyes, allowing you to more easily adjust back to the darkness.
Look at the white line off to the right but still on your side of the road. This allows you to maintain a safe course, see movement around you with your peripheral vision and still avoid looking directly into someone's high beams.
Dim your dash lights to a low but safe level to help your vision while driving at night. Also, use your mirror’s “night” setting. This helps to reduce glare from vehicles that are behind you.
Clean your headlights, wipers, and windshield regularly. Spots on the windshield become sources of glare when you are driving at night.
Have regular maintenance on your car that includes headlight and fog light adjustments. Even a degree or two of difference can prevent your lights from causing vision problems for other drivers.

, The best way to see in the dark is to let yourself slowly acclimate by relaxing in perfect darkness for 20 to 30 minutes.To adjust to the darkness more quickly, wear an eye mask, or close and cover your eyes, to give your eyes a chance to adjust before entering a darkened area.
Try an eyepatch. By protecting one eye from light for 20 to 30 minutes, you will be able to enter a darkened area with that eye already accustomed to the darkness., Your eyes have natural blind spots and navigating your way through an area in darkness can cause problems if you try to center your gaze.Try to focus your gaze on the side of any object you think is there, or just off-center of the direction you are going as you move forward through a dark area. This allows your peripheral vision to help detect movement and object shape much better than trying to look at something directly.
Using your peripheral vision engages more rod cells, which are key in navigating your way through a dark area, identifying shapes, and detecting movement.

, Remember, your rod cells do not see color or detail, and they are your guide in the darkness.The night sky provides a source of light. By positioning yourself as low as possible, the light from the night sky or a window provides enough contrast to help the rod cells in your eyes do their job more easily.
In some forms of martial arts training, students are often instructed to stay as low as possible, using the sky to illuminate objects and opponents by creating a silhouette.
While the rods in your eyes are far more light-sensitive than the cones, they can only discriminate between black and white and provide low-quality images by contrasting the available light source behind objects.

, Close your eyes tightly and use the palms of your hands to apply slight pressure to your eyes..


After about 5 or 10 seconds into the massage, the normal blackness turns to white for a few seconds. When the white fades and the blackness returns, open your eyes and your vision will be better in the darkness.
Special Forces have reportedly used a similar method of squeezing their eyes shut tightly for five to 10 seconds once they were in a dark area. Science has not proven the efficacy of this technique, but it may be helpful for some people.

, Be sure you move around safely if you are attempting to do so before your eyes have adjusted to the darkness.Keep both feet on the ground, your arms outstretched, and move slowly. Listen for changes in sound that may indicate a door, hallway, or window. Be sure to move your arms and hands to avoid walking into a tree or the edge of an open door.

, Research is ongoing, but promising, in working with people that are blind. They are developing the ability to perform clicking sounds with their tongue, termed “flash sonar”, which is similar to the sonar used by bats.


By using flash sonar, people can locate objects in front and around them in a remarkable way. For example, one person demonstrated this method by using clicking sounds made with her tongue to “scan” the space in front of her until she could locate a pot held by another person. With a few more clicks, she could identify the type and contour of the lid on the pot.
Another person that is considered a flash sonar expert can ride a mountain bike through difficult terrain and navigate an obstacle course without incident by using this technique.
The experts of flash sonar claim that it is a skill that anyone can develop.

, A few hours of exposure to bright sunlight light and ultraviolet radiation from the sun can reduce your ability to adjust to darkness.Daytime exposure to the bright sunlight without wearing sunglasses can cause your adjustment to the darkness to be delayed by about 10 minutes for every 2 to 3 hours of bright sunlight exposure.
Plus, in addition to the time delay in adapting to the dark, the degree of night vision is also reduced. For example, ten consecutive days of exposure to bright sunlight without protective eyewear can reduce your night vision by as much as 50%.
With time, your rods, cones, and photopigments return to baseline. Every person is different in the length of time they may be impacted.
Sunglasses with neutral gray lenses that transmit 15% of visible light are recommended.

, If you're working at night, it's best to keep the light on your computer as low as possible.Staring directly into a bright computer screen while the rest of your room is super-dark will diminish your night vision considerably. It's an easy and quick trick to seeing better at night.
Some software programs are available that adjust your screen brightness based on the time of day.

, Take frequent breaks from focusing on a screen, reading something in print, or focusing on other things intently for an extended period.Rest your eyes often. For every 20 minutes of intense work, especially looking at a computer screen, take a break and look off into the distance for 20 seconds. This gives your eyes a chance to refocus.
For every two hours of constant focus on a computer screen or something else that requires intent viewing, rest your eyes for 15 minutes.
Protect your eyes from tiredness by taking short five or ten-minute naps in the middle of the day. Close your eyes and massage them gently. You don't need to go to sleep to rest your eyes.

, Most people know that smoking comes with many health risks, such as lung cancer and COPD, but many don't know that it can lead to serious eye disease or even blindness.Nicotine can cause your eye to stop producing something called rhodopsin, which is a pigment that is essential for night vision.

If you quit smoking, you may be able to restore your night vision.

, Using your peripheral vision is essential in improving your ability to see in low-light situations.Your peripheral vision–what you see out of the corner of your eye–is mostly about movement, utilising the rod cells in your eye.
Improving your peripheral vision is an effective way of seeing better in low light.
While it takes a great deal of practice for most people, you can learn to exercise your peripheral vision to strengthen your low-light sight.

Exercising your eyes to improve your vision, including your peripheral vision, is essential to improving your ability to see in the dark.

, Strengthening the peripheral vision is important in many situations, including athletics.This exercise is done by using a regular, solid colored, drinking straw. Draw a black line around the center of the straw.
With the help of a partner, stand one to two feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters) away from the straw armed with a toothpick in each hand. Your partner is to hold the straw horizontally.
While you are looking at the black line, notice the ends of the straw using your peripheral vision.
Focus only on the black line. Attempt to place the toothpicks in the ends of the straw on either side without diverting your gaze away from the black line.
Once this is easy, try using two straws connected to make the exercise more difficult.

, Another way to improve your peripheral vision for low-light situations is to focus on it and use it more during normal daylight.Sit quietly anywhere, but preferably outside where there are a lot of new things to see. Focus on one thing or object directly in front of you.
Make a mental list of everything you can see around you, both moving and not moving, without diverting your gaze from the central object. Relax your vision and look around to see what you may have missed. Make a mental note as to the general distance from center that you were able to identify things around you.
Try again in a different area, and see if you can expand the general distance from center that you can identify things around you.

, One of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness.In Ancient Egypt, it was discovered that night blindness could be cured by eating liver, which was later found to be a rich source of vitamin A.
Low vitamin A levels can also cause the cornea to become very dry, leading to the clouding of the front of the eye, corneal ulcers and vision loss, as well as retina damage and problems with the conjunctiva.
Carrots, broccoli, squash, cantaloupe, fish, liver, fortified cereals, dairy products, kale, blueberries, and apricots are all excellent sources of vitamin A.
While increasing your consumption of foods that are rich in vitamin A may be helpful, research done in this area has revealed that, in the case of vitamin A, taking supplements provided higher levels than increasing the dietary sources. Plus, excessive consumption doesn't strengthen your eyes.
Vitamin A supplements are available in oral doses, like tablets or capsules, and are marketed in either mcg strengths or units. The average recommended adult dose of vitamin A in mcgs is between 800 to 1000 mcg each day. In units, the dose range is between 2600 and 3300 units consumed daily.
The protein rhodopsin found in the eye breaks down into retinal and opsin when exposed to light and reforms when back in the dark. A severe lack of vitamin A in the diet may result in night blindness, but extra vitamin A will not help one see better than normal.

, The most benefit from dietary sources in improving night vision — and your eyesight in general — comes from focusing on the vegetables you eat.Foods like kale, spinach, and collard greens are full of nutrients that protect your eyes by filtering specific wavelengths of light that can damage your retina.
These foods may also work to protect your eyes from some degenerative processes, such as age-related macular degeneration.

, Specifically, eat more foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids.Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, especially oily types of fish like salmon and tuna, kale, vegetable oils, nuts, especially walnuts, flax seeds and flaxseed oil and leafy vegetables.
Omega-3 fatty acids fight macular degeneration and promote overall eye health and good vision, as well as fighting dry eye.
In one study, patients who ate oily fish once per week had half the risk of developing neovascular macular degeneration, compared with patients who didn't. Long term, over a period of 12 years or so, the risk remains much lower with a higher level of omega-3s.

, Bilberry is a plant that is used in making different types of medicine.


Research done on bilberry has determined it to be possibly effective for eye problems that involve the retina.
The most promising research supports the use of bilberry in situations that involve retina changes related to medical conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.
Bilberry has been reviewed for use in improving night vision. The results of the research are contradictory. Some evidence suggests that bilberry may provide some benefit in improving night vision, yet other research does not support those findings.
The latest rating suggests bilberry is “probably ineffective” in improving night vision.
Bilberry is not easily found in its raw form but is available as either an extract or made into jams and jellies. Follow the directions on the packaging provided to determine how much to consume each day.

, The surface of the eye is 98% water. Dry eyes will struggle to see at night and are linked to overall dehydration.Drinking plenty of water is essential to overall good health; however the direct link to fluid intake and improving vision is controversial.
Some eye experts argue that certain circumstances that negatively impact your level of hydration cause a decrease in the quality of your vision and the overall health of your eyes.
For example, being exposed to high temperatures, low humidity climates, or intense sunlight can cause the basal tear layer to dehydrate, resulting in a negative impact on your vision.
Follow recommended dietary guidelines for water intake, aiming for about 64 ounces (1.9 liters) each day depending on your work situation and environmental factors, to maintain your eye health.

, Taking care of your vision in both day and night circumstances involves seeing an ophthalmologist and/or an optometrist. Most eye doctors suggest annual appointments to be sure your vision has not significantly changed.If you do not see well in natural light, then you won't see well at night either. Schedule an appointment and talk to your doctor about your night vision.
Be sure any corrective lenses you have are meeting your current needs. Your vision changes naturally over time and your prescription for lenses may need to be updated.

, Work with your doctor to be sure you are addressing any problem you may have with dry eyes.Healthy, moist, and relaxed eyes see more effectively in daylight and at night, while tired and dry eyes struggle to pick up motion in low light.
Take it easy on your eyes by keeping them moist and rested. Blink frequently especially when you are regularly focused on a screen, like a computer, laptop, reader, or TV screen.
If you struggle with dry eyes, use over-the-counter saline eye drops regularly to fight redness and provide adequate moisture, or talk to your eye doctor about using prescription strength eye products that treat conditions of dry eyes.

, In many routine exams, the doctor may not ask questions about night vision.Be sure to describe any problems you may be experiencing with night vision. While many visual changes are related to a natural decline with age, some cases may be tied to an underlying medical condition contributing to the problem.
Examples of diseases and conditions that cause visual changes include cataracts, macular degeneration, astigmatism, glaucoma, presbyopia, and near- or farsightedness.

, Make an appointment with your regular doctor to evaluate possible medical causes. Some medical conditions and medications can contribute to problems with your vision.Some examples of medical conditions that may contribute to visual changes include diabetes, migraine headaches, infections, glaucoma, strokes, sudden changes in blood pressure, or sudden trauma like an injury to the head., In addition to medical conditions, there are many medications that have visual changes as part of their side effect profile.Some common examples of drugs that can alter your vision include muscle relaxers such as cyclobenzaprine, diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, and a drug used for seizures, headaches, and mood changes called topiramate.
Never alter your medications on your own. If you are experiencing visual changes that may be caused by your medications, talk to your doctor to tweak your dose or select an alternative agent that can work just as well for your condition without the unwanted visual changes.

Throw away any eye-make up, such as mascara and eyeshadow. In fact, it's best not to wear eye makeup at all during an infection.
Throw away any contact lens solution used during or before the outbreak of symptoms.
Any disposable contact lenses should be thrown away. If you use extended wear contacts, clean them as directed on the box. Throw out the contact lens case and get a new one to use after your infection has cleared. You should not wear contact lenses during a pink eye infection.
Clean eyeglasses or cases used during the infection., The discharge that comes from your eye during an infection can leak onto towels, pillowcases, linens, and washcloths. Such items should be cleaned daily for the duration of an infection. Wash them in hot water and detergent, and wash your hands after handling such items., In general, anything that has close contact with your eye or another household member's eye should not be shared during a pink eye infection. This includes:


Contact lens equipment, containers, or solutions.
Towels, washcloths, and pillowcases
Eye drops (However, you have a young child you may need to help him or her apply eye drops. Wash your hands before and after applying eyedrops and wear gloves during the process.)Any kind of eye makeup
Sunglasses or eyeglasses

, While it might be tempting to relieve itch by rubbing, the practice should be avoided. Rubbing your eyes will, at best, temporarily relieve symptoms. It also spreads discharge to your hands, face, and nearby objects, which increases the chance of an infection spreading.


To relieve symptoms, placing a damp washcloth over the infected eye is more helpful than itching. Use cold or warm water, depending on what feels best for you. After use, make sure the washcloth is either discarded or washed in warm water and detergent., Clean countertops, faucets, bathroom vanities, and shared phones with an antiseptic cleaner. Such surfaces have frequent contact with our hands and can contain traces of the discharge and fluids that lead to pink eye infections. Wash such surfaces frequently during an infection and then again after symptoms clear up. Also, when returning to school or work, clean off any work stations, keyboards, desks, and areas you had close contact with during your infection., Your eyes will be extra sensitive during an infection, and will require extra care.


In the wind, heat, or cold, wear eye protection to prevent irritation. This can be in the form of goggles, eyeglasses, or sunglasses. Remember, however, such items should be washed thoroughly after use and after an infection clears up.If you work with chemicals, wear safety goggles. While this is a good practice in general, it's especially important to keep foreign materials out of the eyes during an infection.

, During an infection, avoid swimming pools. Bacteria is easy to spread via water and, if you do have contact with a pool for any reason, wear goggles and remove contact lenses before getting in the water., Use the medicine as directed and for as long as instructed, even if symptoms clear up. If you're applying drops, keep the bottle tip clean and do not let it have contact with the eye or eyelids., During a pink eye infection, you should not wear contact lenses. Wear glasses until symptoms have passed, and make sure to wash your contacts before putting them back in. Change your contact solution as well, as this is also likely infected. If you wear disposable contacts, it's best to err on the side of caution and put in a new pair., There are two different types of pink eye that are contagious: viral and bacterial. The duration of the infection depends on its type. Know which type of pink eye you have contracted and how long you will need to take the above precautions to avoid spreading the infection.


Viral pink eye is caused by the same virus that causes the common cold. It generally causes a watery mucous discharge. Symptoms usually improve within three to five days, but can last as long as two weeks, and medicines are not usually prescribed.Bacterial pink eye is caused by bacterial infections and causes redness in the eye and a lot of pus. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for seven to 14 days. Symptoms clear up shortly, and a person is generally not contagious after treatment., If possible, you should stay home from school or work until your infection clears up as bacterial and viral pink eye are highly contagious. In general, pink eye remains contagious as long as the eye continues to tear and produce drainage. It should clear up within three to seven days., If you wait until symptoms clear up, you should not be contagious upon returning to work or school but should still take certain precautions to avoid reinfection.


Do not share eye makeup, eye drops, sunglasses, handkerchiefs, or other items that come in close contact with your eyes with fellow students or coworkers.
Let people know you had a pink eye infection so they can take proper precautions to avoid becoming infected themselves.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Note exposure to any allergens.,
Note exposure to any irritants.,
See your doctor.,
Submit to any diagnostic testing.,
Allow viral conjunctivitis to run its course.,
Take antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis.,
Take the full course of medication.,
Wash your hands often.,
Do not touch or rub your eyes.,
Wash towels and other items in hot water.,
Clean and store your contacts correctly.",How to Diagnose Pink Eye," Though itself just a symptom, you can recognize pink eye by the variety of different effects it has on your eyes. You may experience pink eye symptoms in one eye or both, and they commonly include:Itching or burning sensations
Excessive tearing
The sensation of grittiness in your eyes
Discharge
Eyelid swelling
Pinkish discoloration to the sclera (white portion of your eye)
Light sensitivity;
, “Allergic conjunctivitis” (actually allergic keratitis) mimics the symptoms of pink eye. However, the symptoms are simply related to exposure to an allergen rather than a bacterial or viral infection (which are the primary causes of pink eye).You may also notice temporary runny nose and sneezing while exposed to the allergen that subsides within several hours of removing the substance from your surrounding area.


In the case of allergies, symptoms will likely be most pronounced during spring and fall when pollen counts are highest. Other common allergens include cat or dog dander.Seasonal allergies rarely require medical intervention. Try taking an over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medication as directed by the manufacturer.

, If you’ve recently been exposed to higher than normal amounts of noxious chemicals (such as air pollution or chlorine in a swimming pool), then this can irritate your eyes in a way that mimics pink eye as well.If the removing your exposure to the irritant doesn’t stop the pink eye symptoms within 24 to 36 hours, then you should see your doctor.


If the irritant is an industrial chemical or cleaner, then you should immediately flush your eyes with a sterile solution for at least fifteen minutes while rotating your eyes to flush around your entire eyeball.You can call the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222 for more information regarding dangerous chemical exposure to your eyes.

, If — based on the previous criteria — you’re fairly certain that you have pink eye, you should consult your physician for a precise diagnosis. In addition to clarifying your diagnosis, your doctor will also determine the best treatment regimen for your case. Bacterial conjunctivitis will require a different treatment plan than viral conjunctivitis, for instance., While typically reserved for severe cases or those that haven’t responded to other treatment options, you doctor may also ask you to submit to diagnostic testing to determine the exact strain of bacteria causing your pink eye. This will commonly include an eye exam and possibly even samples swabbed from your infected eye for analysis in a lab.Your doctor may also run these tests if she suspects that the pink eye has been caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.If your doctor determines that your pink eye is due to allergic conjunctivitis, but you don’t know what it is you’re allergic to, then she may recommend allergy testing. This will help you determine the allergens to which you should avoid exposure.Though rare, another diagnostic technique is a conjunctival incisional biopsy, which removes a small amount of tissue from the conjunctiva for microscopic examination.This will only be if your doctor suspects a tumor or a granulomatous disease, which affects your immune system’s ability to fight off certain bacteria and fungi.

, If your doctor determines that your pink eye is due to a viral infection, then he will most likely tell you simply to be patient. Your immune system will fight off the virus, and your symptoms will clear up on their own.This form of pink eye usually occurs in association with other cold or flu symptoms.In select cases (if your physician diagnoses the herpes virus as the source of your viral conjunctivitis, for instance), your doctor may prescribe an antiviral ointment or eyedrops such as acyclovir ointment or ganciclovir gel.These prescriptions will stop the virus from multiplying and potentially causing further damage to your eye(s).

, Many minor cases of bacterial pink eye can clear on their own within a week or two. However, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to help clear the infection sooner and reduce the amount of time that you’re contagious.A wide assortment of antibiotic eyedrops are available for prescription, and your doctor will determine the best option based on several guidelines, including:


Allergies you have to any medications.
Your case history (whether or not pink eye infection has been chronic).
The exact bacteria responsible for the infection.

, If your doctor prescribes either antiviral or antibiotic eyedrops, then ensure you take the entire course of the prescription. Your symptoms may subside after only several days, but you should still take the medication exactly as directed. If you stop early, you’re more likely to experience a recurrence in the infection, and you can also help breed resistant strains of the infection.Contact your doctor immediately if you have an allergic reaction to your prescription, such as a rash, hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or swelling of your face, throat, eyes, or tongue.

, The infections responsible for pink eye are highly infectious. To prevent spreading them to others (or even reinfecting yourself in the case of bacterial conjunctivitis), you should take several preventative measures. Most importantly, wash your hands regularly with warm, soapy water.You can also keep alcohol-based sanitizers around for your hands when soap isn’t available. Use a hand sanitizer that is at least a 60 percent alcohol solution., Though your eyes may itch or feel gritty while you have pink eye, do your best not to touch or rub them.This transfers the virus/bacteria to your hands and everything else you touch after. Even if you don’t have pink eye, touching your eyes vastly increases your risk of accidentally introducing the infection to your eyes.


When you do have to touch your eyes, such as when cleaning away the discharge from pink eye, thoroughly wash your hands both before and after you do and always use a clean washcloth if possible.

, You should wash any item that touches your face while you’re sick—towels, washcloths, sheets, pillowcases, etc.—in hot water and detergent.This will ensure that you kill any of the virus/bacteria present and prevent it from spreading to others and/or reinfecting yourself.


You should also avoid sharing these items — or other shareable items such as eye makeup, make-up brushes, etc. — with anyone who is sick and/or while you are sick., Contact lenses are a very inviting environment for the types of bacteria that can cause pink eye. Make sure that you consistently wash and store your contacts as directed by your eye-care professional.These steps are specifically designed to help avoid eye infections.


You should also throw away any disposable lenses you used while you had pink eye, as well as the lens case you used. For extended-wear lenses, clean them as directed."

Talk to your optometrist about eye exercises.,
Palm your eyes.,
Massage your eyes.,
Strengthen your eyes’ near and far focusing.,
Practice zooming with your eyes.,
Make a figure eight with your eyes.,
Practice rhythmic eye movements.,
Do directional eye exercises.,
End your exercises with palming.",How to Exercise Your Eyes," There is no clear scientific data that shows eye exercises improve your eyesight. So before you attempt eye exercises, it's a good idea to get a professional eye exam done by your optometrist. Your optometrist can then tell you if you have any existing eye problems or issues. Before you try eye exercises, you should ask your optometrist if these exercises would benefit your particular set of eyes.Keep in mind that eye exercises will not cure or solve eye issues like myopia (nearsightedness), presbyopia (an inability to change focus from far to near), or astigmatism (blurred vision due to the shape of your cornea).Most optometrists are skeptical of eye exercises that claim they can help you ""throw away your glasses.""There is no harm in trying these eye exercises if you do not have any eye conditions that will be aggravated by prolonged use of your eyes. But if you have serious eye conditions like cataracts, blindness in one or both eyes, or a recovering cornea injury, avoid doing these exercises.;
, Doing this will reduce stimuli to your eyes and brain. Closing your eyes and applying light pressure to them will spread the tear film in your eyes evenly and relax them.








Sit comfortably in a chair. Rub your hands together until they feel warm.
Close your eyes and cover them lightly with your cupped palms. Avoid applying pressure to your eyeballs. Your nose should not be covered to ensure you have enough ventilation during the palming.
Make sure no light can enter your eyes though gaps between your fingers or the edges of your palms and nose. The light will stimulate, rather than relax your eyes, and deter the process of relaxation. Imagine deep blackness and focus on it.
Take deep breaths slowly and evenly while thinking of a calming scene, like an empty beach, a clear lake, or a still mountain. Once you see nothing but blackness, remove your palms from your eyes.
Repeat the palming for three minutes or more.

, This will help to improve blood circulation around your eyes and face, and prepare your eyes for exercise.








Apply a hot and cold compress: Soak a towel in warm water, and a towel in cold water. Place the warm towel on your face, making sure it drapes over your eyebrows, closed eyelids, and cheeks. After three minutes, remove the warm towel and place the cold towel on your face. Alternate between the two towels as desired, making sure to end with a cold compress. Alternating temperatures on your face will cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation, physiological changes that will stimulate your face and the skin around your eyes.
Do a full face massage: Soak a towel in warm water. Rub your neck, forehead and cheeks with the towel. Then, use your fingertips to gently massage your forehead and closed eyes.
Do an eyelid massage: Wash your hands well. Then, close your eyes and massage them with circular movements of your fingers for one to two minutes. Make sure you press very lightly on your eyes as you massage them. Light pressure will help to stimulate your eyes.

, This exercise will strengthen the muscles in your eyes and help you maintain your current vision level.Sit in a chair or stand in front of a blank wall. Place your thumb about 10 inches in front of your face and focus on it. You can also focus on an object that is five to 10 feet away for 10–15 seconds.
Then, focus on an object that is 10–20 feet in front of you without moving your head. Focus on the object for 10–15 seconds.
After 10–15 seconds, refocus on your thumb. Practice this five times.

, This is a good eye focusing exercise, as you have to constantly adjust how well you can focus on an object from certain distances.








Sit in a comfortable position.
Stretch out your arm with your thumb in the hitchhiking position (thumbs up).
Focus on your thumb. Then, bring the thumb closer to you, focusing until your thumb is about 3 inches in front of your face.
Move your thumb away again until your arm is fully outstretched.
Repeat this exercise three more times, once a week.
You can also practice this exercise by holding a pencil in front of you at arm’s length. Then, move your arm slowly to your nose. Follow the pencil with your eyes until you can’t focus on it any longer.

, This is a great exercise to practice controlling the physical movement of your eyes.








Imagine a giant figure eight on the floor, about 10 feet in front of you.
Trace the figure eight with your eyes, slowly.
Trace it one way for a few minutes and then trace it the other way for a few minutes.

, These movements can help to strengthen your eyes and your hand-eye coordination.








Do bar swings. Bar swings help to test your brain's ability to focus on an object with your eyes and maintain your balance and coordination. Stand in front of a fence, barred window, or something else with evenly spaced vertical lines. Focus on a distant object on the other side of the bars. Relax your body and transfer your weight from one foot to the other. Keep your breathing steady and relaxed. Don't forget to blink while performing this exercise. Continue for two to three minutes.
Do round swings. This exercise helps to strengthen your peripheral vision. Focus on an object in the distance that is close to the ground. Sway as instructed for Bar Swings. Keeping your gaze on the same object, use your peripheral vision to observe your surroundings as you sway. Continue for two to three minutes.

, Moving your eyes in different directions is a good way to exercise your eyes.








Stand or sit upright. Look straight ahead. Without moving your head, look to the left. Focus on what you see. Then look right. Move your eyes side to side five times. Repeat this three times.
Without moving your head, look down. Focus on what you see. Then, look up. Focus on what you see. Repeat this three times.
Without moving your head, look straight ahead. Then, look down and to the left. Focus on what you see. Then, move your eyes diagonally and look up and to the right. Focus on what you see. Repeat this exercise five times. Then, look straight ahead and do the same exercise looking down and to the right and then looking up and to the left. Repeat this cycle three times.

, Always finish up either with palming to relax your eyes after your intense exercise session.








You can also end your eye workout by simply closing your eyes and keeping them shut in a dark, quiet room for several minutes. Let them cool down and rest.

Consider the possibility of food allergies.Oftentimes, mild food allergies and intolerances are the cause of bloating.",How to Prevent Bloating," Apart from it just being bad for you overall, processed food is generally high in all the junk that your stomach doesn't know how to, well, process. High-fat, high-sugar foods take longer for your stomach to digest and thus your stomach is fuller for a longer period of time.Plus, the food from your entire meal builds up in the same place at the same time! No thank you.


Sugar-free foods and frozen foods aren't good, either. Frozen foods are high in preservatives and often in sodium (salt), which is an express ticket to Bloatville. Sugar-free foods aren't a good alternative because the sugar alcohol gets going super fast in your stomach and the bacteria in your intestines goes on overdrive, producing more gas. That gas is the bloating culprit (it's rarely water).;
, Fiber keeps you regular, like grandma might say. If you're constipated, that gut of yours will not fit into those skinny jeans any easier, that's for sure. So load up on that fiber, hydrate yourself, and poo on the regular.


The best fruits for fiber? Raspberries, pears, and apples. Veggies? Artichokes, peas, and broccoli. Grains? Whole wheat spaghetti, barley, and bran. Then there's beans, lentils, and split peas which school that whole list by packing twice as fiber as any of those fruits, veggies, or grains.If you are not constipated, extra fiber can actually make your bloating worse. Drink more water to help avoid this issue. If you have regular bowel movements, look at temporarily avoiding high-fiber foods, especially if you have episodes of bloating accompanied by large amounts of gas., Yep, gassy foods. That's another way of saying take it easy on the cruciferous vegetable family (see why we called 'em gassy foods?) until your body gets used to them. They're super good for you -- so don't rule 'em out; just ease into it.


Those gassy foods are beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, bok choy and cauliflower.That being said, ALL of these foods are SUPER (sooo-ooooh-oooper!) good for you. So start getting used to them now. You can up your intake later. Your body will thank you for it eventually.
Eat fewer carbohydrates. When muscles store glycogen, a certain type of carbohydrate, they also store water in a ratio of one to three, glycogen to water. Cutting foods with high levels of carbohydrates, like bagels and pasta, reduces the amount of excess water stored in the body.

, Cooked vegetables are often easier to digest than raw vegetables.


The cooking process removes some of the fiber and enzymes that can cause stomach upset and bloating.
Try steaming your vegetables. Steaming is quicker, uses less water, and minimizes the amount of lost water-soluble nutrients that leech off into the water when you boil your vegetables. When you boil them, they are submerged in water longer, which reduces the amount of nutrients left in the veggie.

, Water is always your best bet. If that's boring, go for the flavored kinds or infuse your own water with fruit (yum). But tea is good, too; not only does it suppress your appetite, but it also can work as an anti-bloating agent.You know that fizz in soda, pop, or whatever it is you call it? That doesn't go away in your stomach! Those bubbles stay in there and keep on bubbling -- which obviously adds to the gas in your intestines. So apart from them being just empty calories (even the diet ones aren't good for you), they cause you to bloat, too. Need more reasons to quit drinking soda?
Drinks that are acidic in nature irritate the GI tract. As a result, the tract swells, causing you to feel bloated. Acidic drinks include coffee, tea, juice, and alcohol.
You should also avoid drinks made from sugar substitutes. Sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol are sugar alcohols that actually bring on bloat.

, This is one you've probably heard before: salt leads to bloating. The reason is because the more salt in your body, the more it desperately clings onto water. Turns out just a teaspoon of salt has 2,300 mg of sodium, which is the absolute limit recommended by doctors per day.Too much sodium in your diet can be hard on your heart and blood vessels (as if you needed more reasons). Avoid salting food before, during, and after cooking. You also shouldn’t use salted blends, like garlic salt or seasoning salt.

, Black pepper and chili powder stimulate the release of stomach acid. Other hot ingredients, like hot sauces and vinegar, do the same. When the stomach releases acid, it causes irritation, which can worsen bloating.

, Though there's no ""anti-bloating"" label you can really put on natural foods, there are a few studies that suggest there are foods out there that are good for keeping excess water and gas out of your system. Peppermint tea, ginger, pineapple, parsley, and yogurts are all on this list.Bananas, cantaloupe, mangoes, spinach, tomatoes, nuts, and asparagus are high in potassium -- a mineral that's high in asparagine -- a natural diuretic.Those can help beat the bloat, too!
Introduce peppermint or parsley into your diet. While most herbs are okay for the stomach, these two can be especially helpful in treating bloating. Parsley is a diuretic, so it helps to flush out the digestive system. Peppermint improves bile flow, allowing fats to be digested more easily.Seek out potassium.Potassium regulates fluids in the body by balancing out sodium levels. High-potassium foods include bananas, potatoes, cantaloupe, mangoes, spinach, tomatoes, nuts, and asparagus.

, Probiotics are a type of ""good bacteria"" that is commonly used to regulate the digestive system. When the digestive tract is regulated, incidents of bloating are greatly reduced.


Bacterial imbalance in your intestines can cause bloating, which is why restoring that balance with probiotics may rid you of your symptoms.
Yogurt is the most common source of probiotics, but you can also find them in kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, and miso.

, With the busy lifestyles that many of us lead it is very easy to get into bad habits that may cause us to rush meals. When you eat quickly you may unwittingly swallow air along with your food, which then gets trapped and causes bloating. Sounds a little silly, but that's actually how it works!


Try chewing your food 30 times before swallowing; you may not wish to stick with this discipline but it is a great way to become more conscious of the way that you eat and to adjust it accordingly. And to see if it affects the bloat!

, Eating smaller portions is kinder to your tummy -- and your waistline -- so try having 4-5 small meals a day rather than 3 large ones. It keeps your metabolism ticking over nicely and prevents the kind of hunger that can lead to large portions. In addition, to keeping everything running smoothly in there.


Binge eating can lead to bloating, so stick to small meals.Ever felt terrible after Thanksgiving? Yeah. That. That feeling needs to go and never come back. Eating little and often keeps you going and energized and prevents you from having to loosen your belt afterward. Eating is supposed to make you feel good, not exhausted!

, This is especially true if the meal contains lots of carbs. When you load up late at night, you just wake up feeling all puffy-like in the morning. You spend the night retaining water and wake up feeling like a sponge. So if one of your meals is big, make it lunch. Then you have time to work it off!

, Or do anything that ups your air intake needlessly. That means talking while eating, too. The more gulps of air you take in with that food or drink, the more that has to get processed in your body.It has to get rid of it somehow, so it turns into bloating and gas.

, Aunt Flo is the worst. It's bad enough as it is, and then you have to add bloating on top of the mix. But period bloating isn't that different -- it's still a good idea to limit your salt intake, workout, and eat the foods we've talked about. Just take solace in that it'll be over in a few days!


If you'd like to go the extra mile, calcium and magnesium can help. Take a supplement when you feel the bloat coming on. And what else can help? Midol., If you're smacking it and popping it, it's just as bad as using a straw or talking while eating -- you're ingesting extra air that has to go somewhere and just winds up resting in your gut for a while. So if you have to chew that gum, keep your mouth shut!

, Plenty of people have wheat (specifically gluten) or dairy allergies (lactose intolerance) and don't realize that's why they're bloating. On the other hand, plenty of people self-diagnose incorrectly, resulting in them missing out healthy aspects of a balanced diet. So if anything seems amiss, in short? Visit your doctor.


There are dairy products that are lower in lactose, if this applies to you (or if you'd like to run a few personal experiments). Aged cheeses and yogurts are lower in the stuff so you may tolerate them better than drinking plain milk. If you eat these in combination with other things, the results could be different, too., Stress can cause so many problems and bloating is just one of them. This is due to the hormone cortisol which leaps into action when we are stressed causing a number of effects - one being cravings for fats and sugars. One of the best ways to control the level of cortisol in the bloodstream is just a few minutes of physical exercise every day. Although, you know you better than anyone what calms you down.


If you haven't already tried it, consider meditation or yoga. Both have shown to lower cortisol levels and yoga burns calories to boot! Even just 15 minutes of quality ""you-time"" every day can prove beneficial for your body and mind.
Simple breathing exercises can go a long way in reducing stress. Sit in a quiet space and breathe deeply and mindfully for 10 counts.Therapy can be used if you have severe issues with anxiety or depression.

, When it comes to bloating, you should quit smoking to avoid all that air getting into your system. Also, when it comes to your overall health, you should quit smoking because it's terrible for you. It can be the cause of breathing problems, lung cancer, atherosclerosis, and heart disease, just to name a few.It's expensive and it's terrible for those around you, too. Need more reasons?


It's never too late. Your body starts repairing itself as soon as you stop smoking. Your lungs will show improvements in weeks.So give it a try for you, your budget, and those around you.

, Moderate exercise can help regulate the passage of food and air through the digestive trap, reducing future bloating incidents.


Biking for 30 minutes, three times a week or more, might be enough to considerably reduce the frequency of bloating incidents.
Other examples of moderate exercise include walking two miles in 30 minutes, jumping rope for 15 minutes, dancing for 30 minutes, practicing water aerobics for 30 minutes, swimming laps for 20 minutes, and running 1 mile (1.6 km) in 10 minutes.
Weight loss can also reduce bloating, as obesity is one of the leading causes.,

Possible allergens include dairy, peanuts, nuts, gluten, wheat, legumes, soy, eggs, and corn.
Monitor when your bloating occurs. If it happens shortly after consuming a certain type of food, bring it to the attention of your doctor. Your physician will be able to test you further and perform a more accurate diagnosis.

See a doctor.,
Tell your doctor about all of your symptoms.,
Get treatment for chemical exposure.,
Evaluate the severity of your condition.",How to Deal With Pink Eye1," If you think that you have pink eye, it is necessary to see a doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor can determine the cause of your pink eye and recommend the best course of treatment. During your examination, your doctor will inspect your affected eye(s) and eyelids looking for symptoms such as:bright red blood vessels
discharge
irritation/itchiness
swollen eyelids
a pinkish or reddish colored eye;
, If your eye burns, stings, or keeps leaking, tell your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe some medication to help you to deal with these symptoms. Usually, the medications given for pink eye are just eye drops, but your doctor may also decide to give you antibiotics., Conjunctivitis may also be the result of chemicals getting into your eyes. Chemical exposure conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own in 24 to 36 hours, but it is still a good idea to seek medical attention for chemical conjunctivitis.If you have been exposed to a chemical, you should:


Flush your eyes with sterile eyewash right away for about 15 minutes.
Call poison control at (800) 222-1222 for advice on conjunctivitis from chemical exposure.Seek immediate medical attention in severe situations.If you've introduced a dangerous chemical into your eye, you will need to get medical attention as soon as possible, even if you've already rinsed your eye.
Call for emergency services if necessary. In some situations, it may be better to call 911. If anyone else is around you, have them call emergency services for you while you concentrate on rinsing your eyes. The quicker you can get to a hospital, the more likely you are to prevent serious injury or blindness., Some people get pink eye worse than others. If the pink eye that you are dealing with is not too bad, then you may be able to just wait it out. However, if your pink eye is severe, do not attempt to open your eye. Clean it as well as you can, and then have someone take you to the hospital."
"
Follow your doctor’s treatment plan.The right treatment will depend on what caused the pink eye in the first place, which is why it is necessary to see a doctor and get a diagnosis.,
Use prescription eye drops as directed.,
Take antihistamines for allergic conjunctivitis.,
Watch and wait if you have viral conjunctivitis.,
Arrange for some time off of work or school.,
Take steps to prevent another episode of pink eye.",How to Deal With Pink Eye2," Depending on your type of pink eye, your doctor may have prescribed or recommended special eye drops, suggested taking antihistamines, or advised you to watch and wait.


No matter what your doctor has advised, make sure that you follow the instructions, use the medication as directed, and avoid touching the infected eye as much as possible.

, Bacterial conjunctivitis can be treated with antibiotics in the form of eye drops or eye ointment.These drops require a prescription from your doctor and are not available over the counter.


There are many different types of eye drops to choose from. Your physician can recommend the eye drops that will work best for you based on your medical history, sensitivity to certain drugs, or resistance to previous antibiotics.

, Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with allergy medications such as antihistamines. Your doctor may recommend that you take a daily antihistamine, like over-the-counter Benadryl, to help clear up your pink eye.In some cases, allergic infections will go away on their own if you avoid contact with the agent that you are allergic to., Viral conjunctivitis usually goes away on its own after 2-3 days and does not need antibiotics or any prescription medication.If you have viral conjunctivitis, then your doctor may just advise you to wait and see if your pink eye clears up on its own.


If your condition does not improve or if your symptoms worsen, call your doctor right away.

, If the type of pink eye that you have is contagious, your doctor will likely recommend that you take some time off from school or work. Depending on the type of pink eye that you have, your doctor may recommend between 1 and 5 days off from school.Viral conjunctivitis takes about 3-5 days to clear up.
Bacterial conjunctivitis takes about 24 hours to clear up with the help of an antibiotic.

, The best way to deal with pinkeye is to avoid getting it. You can reduce your chance of getting pink eye by using methods to avoid spreading the infection. Conjunctivitis can easily spread from one person to the other, so use the following strategies to help protect yourself:Avoid touching or rubbing your eye, and wash your hands right after if you do.
Avoid sharing eye makeup, sunglasses, or towels with other people.
Children are more susceptible to these kinds of infections, so avoid direct contact with children.

Clean your affected eye(s) often.,
Apply a cold compress to soothe discomfort caused by pink eye.,
Use over the counter artificial drops.",How to Deal With Pink Eye3," Pink eye is often accompanied by drainage, which can build up and cause your eyes to crust over. It is important to keep your affected eye(s) as clean as possible. Use a wet washcloth to wipe away any drainage from your eye(s). You can also use tissues or paper towels.


Use a fresh tissue or clean part of the washcloth each time you wipe your eye.
Make sure that you wipe from your inner eye (near your nose) towards your outer eye.
Dispose of tissues right after you use them and put washcloths into the dirty laundry right away.

, You can soothe some of the discomfort associated with an infection by applying cool sterilized compresses to your closed eyes.Avoid using warm compresses because they can increase the spread of infection. Also, make sure that you use a separate compress for each eye and that you use a clean towel every time you use a compress.To make a compress:


Put some ice in a clean, plastic bag and seal.
Wrap the bag with tinfoil. This is needed to prevent the ice melting quickly from your body heat.
Wrap once more with a paper towel or a towel to secure contents. This also allows compress to be less messy and more comfortable.
Gently put your compress on one eye. Leave it there for 5 minutes.
Repeat process with the other eye for 5 minutes.

, Artificial drops can help ease your symptoms by reducing the gritty sensation that sometimes accompanies pink eye. If you are already using prescription eye drops, make sure to ask your doctor about using lubricating drops in addition to prescription eye drops.Your best bet for eye drops that will not interact negatively with prescribed medications is plain sterile saline solution. Your pharmacist can help you find it.

Choose sunglasses that are polarized to reduce eyestrain from glare sensitivity. They should also have an ultraviolet element to protect your eyes from UVA and UVB rays.These rays can cause cataracts, with UVB rays also potentially leading to macular degeneration.You should also try to stay indoors between the hours of 11am and 3pm.If you're getting total radiation body treatments (like those used for cancer treatments), you also need to protect your eyes. Wear goggles or other eye protective shields recommended by your doctor.;
, Sit at least a foot away from your computer or television, since the screens generate a low level of radiation. While no studies have established a correlation between lit screens and cataracts, you should try to distance yourself and limit screen time. This can improve your overall vision.Reduce glare that's harsh on your eyes by closing blinds. Adjust your computer monitor so the brightest light is at a 90°angle with your monitor. Don't forget you can also adjust the brightness and contrast to decrease eye strain.Follow the 20-20-20 method. Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen to any object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It may help to set a reminder alarm., Since you can't see cataracts with the naked eye, it's important to have your eyes checked on a regular basis. If you are 40 or older, it's incredibly important that you go in for regular eye exams with your eye doctor. If you're between the age of 18 and 60 with no risk, get an exam every two years. If you're between the age of 18 and 60 with risks, get your eyes examined every year.If you're over 61 with no risks, you should gradually have your eyes examined every year, or more if you have risks., Smoking makes it harder for your body to repair damage since it releases free radicals into your body. The more free radicals that are in your body, the more cells are harmed which could contribute to cataract formation.You should also avoid having more than one drink a day. Studies have shown that alcohol decreases calcium stability in the lens of your eye.


Alcohol also changes the eye's protein interaction which will increase your risk of membrane damage., Studies have shown that you can prevent cataracts by eating dark, leafy green vegetables that contain antioxidants. Antioxidants, like the lutein and zeaxanthin (which are both found naturally in the retina and lens) are proven to work against cataract formation. They absorb harsh light and UV rays. If you supplement, try to get more than 6 mg of lutein and zeaxanthin a day. Good sources of antioxidants include:Kale
Spinach
Collard greens
Turnip greens
Dandelion greens
Mustard greens
Beet greens
Radicchio
Summer and winter squash

, Medical studies recommend that you get vitamin C from your diet, rather than from supplements.While supplements can help prevent cataracts, you'd need to take them for nearly ten years before noticing any of the health benefits.If you choose to supplement, follow the recommended daily allowance (90 mg for men, 75 mg for women, 35 mg for smokers). Instead, eat the following fruits and vegetables:Cantaloupe
Cauliflower
Grapes
Lychees
Squash
Broccoli
Guava
Bell peppers
Oranges
Strawberries

, Try to get your vitamins from a diet full of fruits and vegetables of a variety of colors. This variety will contain plant chemicals (phytochemicals) that can keep you in good health. If you supplement, follow the recommended daily allowance (22 IU for men or 33 IU for women). Or, get vitamin E from the following:Spinach
Almonds
Sunflower seeds
Wheat germ
Peanut butter
Collard greens
Avocados
Mango
Hazelnuts
Swiss chard

, Get regular exercise, at least 150 minutes a week. Break your exercise into manageable chunks of time to get the same health benefits.Moderate exercise or vigorous walking has also been shown to lower the risk of cataracts.According to medical studies, the more rigorous the exercise, the more your risk of cataracts is reduced.Cataracts is strongly linked to diabetes. Being overweight or obese can increase your risk of diabetes, so maintain a healthy weight.

, Cataracts are common in old age and can happen in one or both eyes. Talk to your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:Blurry vision
Colors that seem faded
Difficulty reading and driving
Glaring of vision (when you see halos around lights)
Poor vision at night
Double vision
Frequent prescription changes in eye wear

, To check for cataracts, your eye doctor will perform a regular eye exam along with a few additional tests.For instance, your doctor may do a slit lamp exam. This uses high-intensity light magnification to see the lens and other parts located behind the eye. Your eye doctor will be able to tell if there's any trouble with light passing through your eye because of cataracts.


Your eye doctor will probably dilate your eye to enlarge the pupil. Eye drops are given and once your pupils dilate, the doctor will look be able to see more of your actual eye to diagnose any problems.

, Not all cataracts are the same, although cloudy visual disturbance is a general symptom. Cataracts are placed into four categories depending on their location, symptoms, and degree of vision changes. Types of cataracts include:


Nuclear cataracts: These affect the center of the eye. At first, they can cause nearsightedness, but eventually the lens becomes yellow or brown. A main symptom is the inability to distinguish between colors.
Cortical cataracts: These affect the edge of the lens. Whitish wedge-shaped opacities or streaks can extend to the center on lens and interfere with light. This means patients usually experience problems with glare.
Posterior subcapsular cataracts: These begin with small or opaque areas that usually form in the back of the lens. Patients suffer from reading disturbances and sensitivity to bright light. Another symptom is seeing halos around bright lights, especially at night.
Congenital cataracts: These cataracts form before birth, usually because of an infection the mother has at birth (such as rubella, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia, or muscular dystrophy).Pediatricians will check for the cataracts shortly after birth. If they block the central visual axis, the cataracts will need to be removed to prevent amblyopia (lazy eye). If the cataracts are small or off axis, surgery may not be necessary. Instead, the doctor may simply observe them.

, Some medical conditions or factors may mean you're predisposed for cataracts. For instance, Diabetes (type 2) can prevent you from metabolizing carbohydrates. Since the development of cataracts is related to hyperglycemia, diabetes are known to get cataracts faster.African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women are especially at risk.In addition, the following are risk factors for cataracts:Increasing age
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking
Excessive exposure to sunlight
Exposure to ionizing radiation (such as that used in X-rays and cancer radiation therapy) or toxins
Family history of ocular (eye) disease such as cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degeneration
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Obesity
History of eye injury or inflammationHistory of eye surgery
Working in occupations that are highly demanding visually or hazardous to your eyes
Taking prescription or nonprescription drugs with ocular side effects like corticosteroid medications (Steroids can generate steroid cataracts and antipsychotics have also been linked to cataracts.)Wearing contact lenses
German measles while you were in the womb

, Since cataracts continuously cause your eyes to deteriorate, it's important to try to delay damage. Surgery is an option and delaying it will only cause reduced eyesight. To prevent cataracts from progressing further, try:Wearing stronger glasses or contact lenses
Using a magnifying glass when reading fine print
Using, strong, clear lighting
Pupil-dilating medication

, Surgery is available to remove a cataract or cloudy lens that is a result of normal aging. It's replaced with another lens and you'll usually recover in about 24 hours.Your doctor may prescribe lubricating drops and antibiotics to prevent infection after the surgery.Cataracts that cloud the outside portion of the lens may not need to be removed because the central vision is spared.After the surgery, you may feel like you have a foreign body in your eye. This is usually caused by dry eyes from the stitches or a cut nerve. In the case of a cut nerve, it will take a few months to regenerate before you stop feeling the symptoms.

Get plenty of rest.",How to Increase Upper Body Strength," For a large, strong chest, there are few exercises better than the bench press. Whether you're using free weights or an exercise machine, bench presses involve laying horizontally and pushing a heavy weight away from you. Note that if you are using free weights, you should strongly consider using a spotter — someone who stands over you while you exercise and helps you lift the weight back into place if it becomes too heavy for you. Though rare, bench press accidents where the weight falls onto the lifter's chest can potentially cause major injury or death.To do a bench press, simply lay down underneath a barbell at a sturdy bench with a barbell rack over it. Position yourself so that your arms and chest are slightly below the weight in the rack, then carefully lift it out of the rack so that it's aligned with your arms and chest. Lower the weight down so that it's just barely touching your chest, then push hard to bring it back up. Repeat as needed, making sure to replace the weight in the rack before you're too exhausted to lift it.
If you don't have a spotter, consider using a chest press machine. These machines usually allow you to perform virtually the same chest exercise with the benefit of built-in safety stops and an upright posture, making them much less risky to attempt alone.;
, For a lower-risk alternative to bench presses, try flies. These exercises, which get their name from the fact that they mimic the flapping motion of a flying bird's wings, involve moving a set of weights in a half-circle arc in front of your chest using the muscles near your armpits. Flies can be done lying flat on your back with a set of dumbbells, sitting upright at an exercise machine, or even standing in front of a cable setup.


To do a dumbbell chest fly, lay horizontal on a bench with a weight in each hand. Hold the weight out to either side with your elbows bent slightly. Keeping your elbows motionless, use your chest muscles to bring the weights up over you until they meet in front of your chest. Slowly lower them back to your sides, keeping your elbows stationary throughout the exercise.

, Each side of the chest is mostly made up of one large, fan-shaped muscle called the pectoralis major.Since this muscle is so large and wide, it's important to work every part of it evenly to promote optimal strength and balanced muscle growth. To hit the upper and lower parts of the chest, try doing bench presses at incline and decline benches, respectively.


An incline bench is one that's tipped up slightly from the horizontal bench press position. In other words, your head should be higher than your legs while you do the bench press.
By contrast, a decline bench is one that's tipped down slightly from the horizontal bench press position. In other words, your head should be lower than your legs.

, It's important to mention that you don't need any weightlifting equipment to get a strong chest. Pushups, one of the quintessential chest exercises, can be done almost anywhere and offer a great workout for the shoulders, abs, and triceps in addition to the chest (depending on the form you use for your pushups. Pushups come in many different variations — a few of the most common are listed below:


Basic pushup: Lay face-down on the floor with your palms against the floor and your arms tucked up by your sides. Push off of the floor with your arms, supporting yourself with the palms of your hands and the tips of your toes. Keep your body as straight as possible and your arms tucked near your sides while doing this. Lower yourself back to the floor and repeat.
""Easy"" pushup: Done the same as basic pushups, but with the knees together and touching the floor.
Elevated pushups: Done the same as basic pushups, but with the feet propped on a chair or another piece of furniture to make the exercise more difficult.
Diamond pushups: Done the same as basic pushups, but with the hands positioned right next to each other beneath the center of your chest so that your thumbs and index fingers form a diamond.
One-arm pushups: Done the same as basic pushups, but with one arm tucked behind the back.
Clap pushups: Done the same as basic pushups, but push up hard enough to be able to clap in midair and return hands to original position.

, One of the best exercises for strengthening your back and lats (the muscles along the side of your torso under your armpits) is the pullup. This exercise, which is similar to (but not the same as) the chin-ups described above, involves hanging from a bar and pulling yourself up to it so that your chest comes near it. In addition to the back and lats, pull ups can work your shoulders and arms as well, making them a great all-around upper body exercise.


To do a standard pullup, grip a sturdy horizontal bar with your palms facing away from you and your hands about shoulder-width apart. Without twisting, swinging your legs, bending your knees, or shuddering, pull your body up to the bar. Ideally, your chest should get as near to the bar as possible — if possible, even touch it. Lower yourself back down to a ""dead hang"" and repeat.
Try changing the width of your grip to work different muscle groups. Wider grips minimize the contribution of the arm muscles, making your lats and back work harder.

, Not everyone can do a pullup, and even fewer can do more than just a handful at a time. If you find pullups to be excessively difficult, you may want to try pulldowns. These exercises, which usually require an exercise machine or cable setup to do, involve pulling a weighted bar from an overhead position down to chest-level. Thus, they allow you to perform basically the same motion as is used for pullups, but with less resistance.


To do a pulldown, sit on a bench in front of a pulldown machine and grab the bar with a wide overhand grip. Lean back slightly and use your back and lats to pull the bar down to your chest. Slowly raise the bar back up and repeat. Don't bend at the hips or waist to assist in this exercise, as this can make it easier and may even lead to lower back pain.

, As their name suggests, rows involve mimicking the ""pulling"" motion used by someone who's rowing a boat. Row exercises come in many varieties and are usually done from a bench or while sitting. Below is an example of a dumbbell row exercise — seated row machines and cable setups are also common at gyms.


To do a dumbbell row, first, crouch over a bench and place your right palm and right knee on the bench to support yourself. Keeping your back straight, motionless, and parallel to the floor, grab a dumbbell in your left hand. Pull the weight straight up to the side of your chest using your back muscles (and not your arms). Don't let your upper torso swing or twist during this motion. Lower the weight back down and repeat. Mirror these movements for your right hand.

, Believe it or not, it's possible to get a great lat workout with nothing more than a medicine ball. This exercise, which is appropriately called the overhead slam, involves repeatedly tossing a medicine ball at the floor with great force — almost as if you're dribbling a basketball as hard as humanly possible.


To do an overhead slam, start by holding a medicine ball out in front of you with both hands. Raise the ball over your head, fully extending your body as you do so. Bring the ball down fast and toss it into the ground in front of you as hard as you can. Catch the ball as it bounces back and repeat., One often-overlooked exercise that's vital for preventing injury is called the deadlift. When done correctly, this exercise strengthens the important muscles of the lower back, hips, and core. This makes it harder to hurt your lower back doing other exercises. Since back pain is the most common cause of job-related disability in the United States, this exercise can be a crucial part of almost anyone's workout.However, the deadlift can be difficult for newcomers to perform with good form, so consider watching or working with and experienced weightlifter before attempting the exercise yourself and use low weights until you're a confident lifter.


To do a standard deadlift, first, place a weighted deadlift in front of you on the ground. Put your feet about shoulder-width apart with the balls of your feet under the bar. Squat down and grab the bar. Bend at your knees and hips, not your waist, as if you're sitting back into a chair. Keep your back straight. Grab the bar with one hand facing you and the other facing away. Your hands should be slightly more than shoulder-width apart so that your legs fit between them.
Next, lower your hips so that your thighs are parallel to the floor and your calves are pointing more or less up-and-down. Lift the weight by standing up, moving your hips and shoulders at the same rate and keeping your head up throughout the movement. Your back should not bend or arch at any point. Reverse the ""standing up"" motion to return the weight to the floor.

, One of the most universally-known upper body exercises, the bicep curl is a simple, accessible exercise that works the inside part of your upper arm. To do this exercise, you'll need either a set of dumbbells (one-handed weights), a barbell (a larger two-handed weight), or something similar, like a bag of heavy groceries.


To do a bicep curl, stand up and grip your weight(s). Hold them at your waist or thighs with your palms facing forward. Keeping your elbows stationary and tucked at your sides, raise the weight(s) up near your chest or neck. Immediately lower the weight almost all the way back down (stopping just short of extending your arm completely), then repeat. Use slow, smooth motions throughout.
For best results, try doing three or four sets of curls. Aim for about 10-15 repetitions (or ""reps"") per set and take a short break in between each set (for beginners, up to a 90-second rest is fine).Similar numbers of sets and repetitions are suitable for all of the exercises in this article, unless otherwise noted.

, While bicep exercises may be the go-tos for those looking to make aesthetic gains, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that the triceps are actually a more important, useful muscle group (and can even help you look and feel better when they're ""buff."")To work your triceps, try an exercise called the tricep extension, which can be done with a single dumbbell or a cable setup.


To do a tricep extension, start by standing and holding the weight just behind your head with your elbows bent at ninety degree angles. Slowly extend your arms to move the weight above your head, then lower it back to the starting position and repeat.

, Toned, powerful deltoids (shoulders) look great and even help you lift and carry heavy weights without hurting yourself. To pump up your shoulders, try shoulder presses. These versatile exercises are basically as simple as lifting a heavy weight over your head and can be performed standing up or sitting down with dumbbells, a barbell, a cable setup, or even a heavy object you happen to have around.


To do a shoulder press, stand or sit up so that your back is straight and grab your weight so that it's evenly balanced just over each shoulder. Using your shoulder muscles, push to lift the weight over your head with smooth, steady movements. Carefully lower the weight back down and repeat.

, Though the big biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscle groups are the most noticeable ones in the arm, working the muscles in the forearms can have major benefits as well. Strong forearms give your hands powerful grip strength, making it easier to climb, perform pullups, and do other tasks that require you to grip hard. In addition, toned, muscular forearms can be the eye-catching ""cherry on top"" of a chiseled body you've been working hard for. To work your forearms out, try using an exercise called a wrist curl, which you can do with a set of dumbbells, a barbell, or a cable setup.


To do a wrist curl, sit at a bench or stand up straight and grab your weight in both hands with your palms facing forward. Let the weight hang down in front of you and curl the weight upward, keeping your arms still and using only your wrists. Squeeze your forearm muscles to raise the weight as high as it will go, then slowly lower it back down and repeat.

, One versatile exercise that works your biceps, forearms, and shoulders (in addition to your lats, which we'll discuss in-depth below) is the chin-up. As its names suggests, the chin-up involves hanging from a bar and pulling yourself up to it so that your chin reaches the height of the bar. This exercise is simple but difficult to do—many people, especially women, lack the upper body strength to be able to do chin-ups, so it may be necessary to work at other exercises before you attempt this one.


To do a chin-up, find a sturdy horizontal bar that can easily support your weight. Grip the bar with your palms facing you and your hands spaced a little less than shoulder-width apart. Without shaking, twisting, or swinging, raise your chin up over the bar, then slowly let yourself down again and repeat.
You'll probably find that chin-ups are much more difficult for you than the exercises mentioned earlier. You don't have to aim for the 10-15 reps recommended above; instead, aim to do as many as you can without stopping, even if this is just a few.

, Stand with your back straight. Grip a barbell, keeping your hands just outside of your shoulders. Your forearms should be vertical to the floor. Hold the barbell at about the height of your collar bone. Press the weight above your head, extending your elbows until they are straight. Lower your arms to starting position., Chest and back exercises should generally be prioritized over arm and shoulder exercises to prevent injury. When strength training, make sure that you are doing the chest and back first and finishing with the arms. Alternatively, you might decide to do chest and back on one day, and do your shoulders and arms on another day., While an intense upper-body workout can make you look mighty muscular, it's a bad idea to focus only on your upper body. In addition to giving you a top-heavy, lopsided appearance, this can actually be unsafe. Neglecting your core and lower-body muscles can leave you injury-prone (especially for back injuries) by reducing your ability to maintain a strong, secure posture while you exercise.Luckily, all you need to do to avoid this is to include plenty of core and lower-body exercises in your weekly workout! Below is a short list of great exercises for your abs, legs, and more.


Squats
Lunges
Situps
Crunches
Hip flexors
Hanging leg raises

, People who have a history of exercise-related injury may want to avoid any of the exercises above if they put lots of strain on the injured body part. Of particular importance are the back and core muscles, which can cause lasting discomfort if injured. In these cases, substitute low-intensity exercises that put little stress on the affected body part but still work the desired muscles.


For instance, people who have had lower back problems should avoid exercises that compress or twist the spine (like, for instance, twisting situps with a weight held against the chest) which can put pressure on the discs of the lower back. In this case, rather than doing weighted situps, it's a much better idea to exercise the abs with plank exercises, which don't compress the spine.

, Though there is some debate on the matter, many exercise experts recommend a thorough warmup containing stretches and physical exercises at the start of every workout. Proponents of warmups argue that warming up increases blood flow to the muscles and gradually prepares the heart for a heightened level of activity, saving it from the shock of a sudden increase in blood pressure.Below is a sample warmup routine — feel free to modify it to your liking.


Full-body stretches
30 seconds jumping jacks
30 seconds press ups
30 seconds crunches
1 minute jumping rope
Repeat 3x, increasing intensity with each repetition.

, No matter how much your exercise, your body will only be able to build new muscles if you give it the materials it needs for the task. Try to accompany any serious exercise routine with a diet that includes lots of lean protein, whole grain carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Avoid stereotypical ""junk food"", including foods that are high in fat, oils, or sugar. Below are a few brief lists of the sorts of foods you'll want your diet to favor:


Proteins: Chicken breasts, lean cuts of pork and beef, fish, beans, lentils, soy chunks, soy milk and egg white.
Carbohydrates: Whole wheat bread products (bread, pasta, crackers, etc.), brown rice, ""superfood"" grains like quinoa, fleshy or leafy vegetables (broccoli, spinach, etc.), fresh fruit (in moderation).
Fats: Nuts, some fish and seafood, eggs, olive oil, seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, flax, etc.), avocado.

, One of the worst things you can do for your workout is neglect your rest. During periods of inactivity (especially sleep), the body releases growth hormones that signal your tired muscles to start rebuilding themselves stronger than before. If you don't get enough rest, this ""repair"" period won't work as intended and you won't be able to build strength or muscle mass as effectively. Everyone's sleep needs are different, but most reputable sources recommend at least six hours per night — preferably seven to nine."
"
Understand the importance of the right food in your diet.,
Choose healthy carbohydrates.,
Eat more fiber.,
Eat fish twice a week or more often.,
Eat more oatmeal.,
Look for non-starchy vegetables.,
Satisfy your sweet tooth with a few strawberries.,
Drink more water.,
Sprinkle cinnamon onto your food.",How to Lower Blood Sugar With Diet1," Depending on how it's chosen it can cause a gradual rise in blood sugar levels or it can cause the levels to rise too quickly (which most people should avoid). However way your system reacts to your meal depends on the food you have eaten. Complex carbohydrates are likely to cause a gradual rise, while refined carbohydrates and sugar will cause a fast rise in blood sugar levels., Ultimately all food is converted into blood sugar, and consumed to make energy; the idea is to avoid foods where this happens very fast. Sugars, and starches (as found in white bread, or cornstarch, and many other foods) are converted most rapidly, and should be avoided. On the other hand, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (lentils and beans), and a moderate amount of low-fat dairy foods are converted more gradually, and are better sources of energy for almost anyone, especially those avoiding high blood sugar. Note that low fat doesn't necessarily mean low calorie; always read the ingredients list.Healthy whole grains include barley, oats, spelt, wheat, kamut and brown rice.See below for more about oats.
Bread and cereals are healthy provided you steer clear of the high fat and high sugar varieties. Choose bread and cereals containing less than 450mg per 100mg of sodium.Eat some carbohydrate at each meal, but only a reasonable portion. Eat more non-starchy vegetables over starchy ones.
Eat some protein in your meals, too. Proteins are good for you, and can sometimes help moderate the rise in sugar.

, Fiber cleanses your system and soluble fiber (see below) helps control your blood sugar levels. Most vegetables are high in fiber, especially those with leafy greens. Many fruits, nuts, and legumes are also rich in fiber, as are whole-wheat products.



Soluble fiber is very important for maintaining good health. It is found in such foods as beans, nuts, oat bran and seeds.Flax-seeds are both a good source of fiber and for maintaining balanced blood sugar. Grind two tablespoons with 10 ounces of water and consume each morning to gain its benefits., Fish is high in protein, which does not affect blood sugar as much as carbohydrates do. Fish also has less fat and cholesterol than meat and poultry. Many types of fish, including salmon, mackerel, and herring, also have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which lower fats called triglycerides and promotes overall heart health. Avoid fish prone to high levels of mercury, however, like swordfish and king mackerel.


Other sources of healthy, lean protein include legumes, nuts, seeds, peas and turkey or chicken.You might also consider protein drinks with less than 5g of sugar content., Unsweetened oatmeal digests slowly, which prevents your blood sugar from spiking up dramatically while providing your body with the slow-release energy it needs.Lentils and legumes (beans) are just as good. (Some people feel that these foods give them indigestion and gas, until their systems get accustomed to them, so use your judgement.) All of these foods contain soluble fiber, which delays sugar and carbohydrate absorption, which is good.

, Broccoli, spinach, and green beans are excellent examples.These vegetables are low in carbohydrates, so they do not affect your blood sugar very much, but they are also high in fiber and have a cleansing effect. (Lentils, legumes and oats are certainly starchy foods, but their soluble fiber offsets the liabilities of their starch content.)

, In spite of their sweetness, strawberries are actually rather low in carbohydrates and, as such, do not dramatically raise blood sugar levels.They also contain high levels of water, helping you to feel fuller for a longer period of time. As a result, you may feel less tempted by a more harmful sweet later on.

, Soda and sugary juice drinks raise your blood sugar quickly. Substituting these drinks with water, sugar-free tonic water and sparkling water can quickly reduce your sugar intake.Many commercially available waters are also flavored, which may make them more appetizing than plain water. However, beware of added sugar. You can add strawberries, lemon or lime slices or a dash of orange juice to flavor sparkling water at home without adding sugar's empty calories.
Keep some water in the refrigerator with lemon slices already added to it. Very refreshing on a hot day, this water will taste delicious. Keep it topped up and discard the slices and add new ones every two days. Vary the flavorings with other citrus fruits or strawberries, apples or berries.
Try to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day to ensure that you're adequately hydrated.Be careful when consuming fruit juice and keep it to a minimum––fruit juice contains carbohydrate from its natural fructose (sugars)., Some experts believe that cinnamon has a moderate effect at reducing blood sugar levels, especially in people with diabetes. The results are far from conclusive, but early studies do support the claim.Do not rely on cinnamon as a magic solution! It should be treated as an extra addition to all the other excellent suggestions above.
Substitute sugar/artificial sweeteners in hot drinks with agave nectar, as it has a much lower glycemic index.

, Instead of completely altering the way you eat, substitute healthier choices in place of those that could raise your blood sugar.

, In particular, count the refined carbohydrates you're consuming, such as white flour baked products, sugary cereals and fried foods. Carbohydrates have a greater impact on your blood sugar levels than anything else because they break down into glucose, very quickly.

, The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates based on how much they raise blood sugar levels after consumption. Foods with a low GI rating are less likely to raise your blood sugar than those with a high rating.


Be aware that the glycemic index may not catch all sources of sugar beyond glucose. Other sugars, such as fructose and lactose, add to your blood sugar load."

Clean the stye.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Do not squeeze or try to pop the stye yourself.,
Use antibacterial cream.,
Try a natural home remedy.,
Use an over-the-counter painkiller.,
Go to a doctor.",How to Get Rid Of a Stye1," Styes are generally caused by chance but can occasionally be caused by exposure of the eye to foreign substances (such as dust or makeup). The stye itself is a small bacterial infection.If you develop a stye, the first thing you should do is clean the area.Wash your hands thoroughly, then use a cotton ball or clean hands to gently cleanse the stye with warm water. You can also use a special eyelid scrub or diluted tear-free ""baby"" shampoo.Make certain that both your hands and the cotton balls you use to wash the stye are clean. Otherwise, you may transmit more debris or germs to the area.
Styes are most commonly caused by staphylococcal bacteria that gets in a hair follicle or a gland in the corner of the eye, often through touching the eye with dirty hands. Other bacteria, however, can also cause styes.;
, The painful swelling caused by a stye is best treated with warm compresses. Make a warm compress with a clean towel or other fabric dipped in warm water. Place the compress over your eye and let it rest there for five to ten minutes.After the compress cools, re-soak it with warm water and repeat for another five to ten minutes.
Apply warm compresses three or four times a day. Be consistent about this treatment until the stye is gone.Warm (but not hot) and damp tea bags can also be used effectively as compresses. (Some people recommend chamomile tea bags, which may have soothing properties).
The warmth of the compress may cause the stye to shrink or release pus. If this occurs, gently rinse away the drainage. Do not press or squeeze the stye; just apply firm but gentle pressure.
Once the pus emerges from the stye, the symptoms should abate fairly quickly.

, It can be tempting to try to force any pus or debris out of the stye, but resist! Squeezing or attempting to pop a stye can make the situation much worse, spreading or deepening the infection, and may even cause scarring., Buy an over-the-counter antibacterial cream made for treating styes, available at any drug store. If you are unsure about which cream to choose, discuss the available options with the pharmacist. Apply a small dab on the stye, taking care not to get it inside your eye.


These creams may help your stye heal faster.
The local anesthetic many of these creams contain can also provide temporary relief from the discomfort caused by a stye. However, should it get in your eye, the anesthetic can also cause significant damage. Apply with extreme caution.
If you do get any cream in your eye, flush it out gently with warm water. Then, contact your doctor.
Do not use more often than indicated on the packaging.

, Certain natural substances may help heal styes and reduce pain and swelling. Avoid getting the natural remedies inside your eye, and if you feel stinging or discomfort, discontinue use immediately. Although not medically proven, you may wish to try these natural remedies for getting rid of styes:


Use a coriander seed wash. Soak coriander seeds in water for an hour, strain the seeds, and use the water as a wash for your eye. The seeds are said to have properties that reduce the swelling of a stye.
Use aloe. Aloe helps reduce swelling and redness. Cut an aloe leaf lengthwise and apply the pulpy inside to the affected area. If you can't find whole aloe leaves, you can use an eye pad soaked in aloe vera juice. Some people like to use a mix of aloe vera juice and chamomile tea.
Use a guava leaf compress. This is a common home remedy to reduce pain and swelling caused by styes. Wet guava leaves in warm water and apply them to your eye for 10 minutes.
Use potatoes. Grind a potato into paste and spread it on a clean, soft cloth. Then, apply it to the stye to decrease swelling.

, If your stye is extremely painful, use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to make you more comfortable during the first few days. Choose an NSAID containing aspirin or ibuprofen for immediate relief.Take only the recommended dosage listed on the packaging.
Do not give aspirin to children under 18 years of age. Doing so could give them a fatal condition called Reye's syndrome., Seek treatment if your stye does not go away after one week. If you are in extreme pain, if redness or swelling spreads, or if your vision becomes affected, seek immediate medical attention.If a stye gets worse, this may be a result of another condition, and you may receive one of the following treatments:


The doctor may prescribe antibiotic medicines, especially if you have bacterial conjunctivitis, commonly referred to as pinkeye. This condition is usually resolved quickly after antibiotics are administered.The doctor may insert a needle or fine-tipped blade into the stye to lance it. This involves puncturing the stye so that the pus drains out of a small hole and the stye goes away.If you have a skin condition such as rosacea or seborrhea, you might be susceptible to blepharitis, the inflammation of the rims of the eyelids. In this case your doctor will advise you to begin a new hygiene regimen for that area of your eye.If you don't already have an eye doctor, you can consult your primary care doctor and ask for a referral, check your local phone book under ophthalmologists, or search on the internet for “ophthalmologist” plus your city or area.
You should feel free to contact a doctor at any point during this process. You do not need to wait a week before getting in touch with a professional.

Wash your eyelids.,
Wash your hands before touching your face.,
Practice good contact lens hygiene.,
Apply eye makeup properly.",How to Get Rid Of a Stye2," If you frequently get styes, your eyes may be particularly sensitive to bacterial infection. Use a clean towel and some gentle shampoo, such as baby shampoo, or special eyelid scrub to gently clean your eyelids. Rinse well with warm water.If styes a frequent problem for you, your eyelids should be cleaned daily., One of the most common ways to get styes is by transferring bacteria from your hands to your eyes.Avoid rubbing or touching your eyes.


Wash your towels regularly, and never share a washcloth or towel with someone who has a stye.

, Wearing contacts requires touching your eyes often, so make sure your hands are clean each time you put them in and take them out. The contacts themselves can also transmit bacteria, so be sure to use a cleansing solution to wash them daily.Do not wear contacts when you are suffering from a stye. Placing a contact lens on the eye that has a stye on it increases your risk of transmitting the infection from the stye to the underlying cornea.
Don't wear your contacts longer than you're supposed to. If you have dailies (i.e. disposable contacts that are intended only for a single use), throw them away every day. If you have monthlies (reusable lenses that intended to be replaced once a month), be sure to change to fresh ones after four weeks have passed.Don't wear your contacts overnight. Even contacts that are made for safe overnight wear might cause you problems if you are prone to getting styes.Always follow your eye doctor’s recommendation about appropriate contact lens use. Do not wear contact lenses in situations that are specifically approved, such as while swimming (unless you wear them under tight-fitting swim goggles).

, Eye liner and eye shadow applied under the rim of your eyelid can cause styes, especially if you tend to wear a lot of makeup and reapply it throughout the day. Apply makeup above your lash line, and limit the amount that you apply.


Don't go to sleep wearing makeup. Use eye makeup remover to clean it off, then splash warm water on your face to rinse off the remover before going to bed.
Change your eye makeup and applicators frequently. Brushes, wands and pencils used to apply eye makeup get dirty over time, and you may be transmitting bacteria every time you use them.Similar to contact lenses, makeup pencils, brushes, and the like make frequent contact with your eyes. If they harbor harmful bacteria, it is very easy for these harmful agents to cause styes.Do not share eye makeup with other people.

Measure out how much water you'll need each day.,
Make it a habit.,
Drink water when you're distracted.,
Download an app.,
Buy a water bottle you'll love.,
Know your environment and your activity levels.,
If you feel hungry, drink water first.",How to Get Your Eight Glasses of Water a Day1," 2 liters (0.5 US gal) is about 8 glasses of water. Having a container that size may help you remember to drink enough water everyday.If you have an empty 2-liter soda bottle, fill it with water and put it in your fridge. Drink the entire bottle of water over the course of the day.
If you are not drinking the entire bottle of water each day, you may not be getting enough water.;
, Train yourself to drink a glass of water every morning when you first wake up, a glass when you get home from work or school, and a glass every evening right before bed. That's three of your eight recommended daily glasses. You can make a daily water chart to help you get started, and after a while the practice will feel like second nature.


Drinking water in the morning also helps jump-start your metabolism, and is a refreshing way to wake up every day.There are also water bottles on the market with counting systems worked into their design. For instance, some bottles have a little dial that is turned each time 8 oz is drank. This encourages more water consumption.

, Another habit to cultivate is sipping a glass of water while you're doing other work, whether on the computer or watching TV., There are many apps available for your smartphone that can help you keep track of how much water you've drank, or give you reminders to drink more. Many are free, but if you pay for one, you might be more motivated to use it on a daily basis., Carry your bottle everywhere you go. Not only will it reduce the number of disposable water bottles you go through, it may also motivate you to use your new bottle.Remember to use a water bottle that not only looks nice, feels nice and keeps your water cold, but also one that is BPA free and easily washable.

, Health professionals will often advise you to drink more water than usual (which can mean more than 8 glasses a day), depending on environmental factors. If you live in a hot, dry climate, you'll probably need to drink more water than someone who lives in an arctic climate. And if you're exercising, you'll need even more water to stay hydrated.Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink water, especially if you're engaging in physical activity and/or if the weather is hot. By the time you feel thirsty, your body is already dehydrated., This will make you fuller before you eat, and may even stave off cravings, as thirst is often mistaken for hunger."

The way you prepare for and carry out the fast will be largely dictated by your reasons for doing it, so do some research on the type of fast you want to do.


Medical fasts are often prescribed before a patient is scheduled to undergo surgery or another procedure for which anesthesia will be administered. Medical fasts usually last 12 - 24 hours before the scheduled procedure, and can involve abstaining from food and drink or just food.
Detoxifying fasts are meant to cleanse the body of accumulated toxins. They are commonly done after the holiday season, a time of heavy alcohol drinking and consumption of heavy and sugary foods. Detoxifying fasts usually allow juice and other liquids, but not food.

Intermittent fasting is a practice designed to help the body battle health issues or burn fat.Some believe that abstaining from food and drink for periods of 12 to 36 hours helps people lose weight over time.Spiritual or religious fasts are designed to give the mind time to reflect on spiritual ideas while the body abstains from food. The specificities of religious fasts are often dictated in religious texts, and the fasts are carried out to honor ancient traditions. For example, Muslims fast to celebrate Ramadan, a month during which food and drink aren't consumed from dawn until sundown. Observant Jews also fast on certain days of the year, most notably on the holiday of Yom Kippur, which is an absolute fast lasting 25 hours.
;
, Everyone's body responds differently to fasting, and if you've never done it before it can be difficult to predict how it will make you feel. Take a few weeks to get physically prepared before launching into a major fast. You'll have a better chance at succeeding with the fast if you know what to expect.


Talk to a doctor if you are concerned about how fasting might affect your health. Undergoing a fast, especially an absolute fast, can take a dangerous toll on your body if you have a preexisting condition. Get a physical to make sure your body is strong enough to handle limited consumption of food and water.
If this is your first fast, you might want to gradually phase out a few foods first to get used to the feeling of deprivation. For example, wean yourself off of foods containing sugar and white flour a week or two before you start a detoxifying fast, so that your body won't be suffering from major cravings on top of hunger pangs.
Plan to start a fast in your best physical shape. Your body will deal with deprivation better if you start off well hydrated, so drink plenty of water. Eat healthy, nutrient-rich meals in the weeks leading up to your fast. As the first fasting day approaches, make sure your body is free of alcohol and drugs.


, If you've got temptations lying around the house, fasting will be a much harder experience. Get your kitchen ready in the following ways:


Toss out or stow away all prohibited foods and drinks. Don't have candy or a bottle of wine sitting out on the counter; either throw it away or put it in a place where you won't be reminded of its presence.
Clean out your refrigerator. Empty it of anything that might tempt you during the fast, especially pre-prepared food that's easy to eat.
If you're doing a juice or liquid fast, stock the refrigerator with the ingredients you need to make your drinks.
If you're doing an absolute fast, plan to avoid the kitchen altogether. Make sure everything is cleaned up and put away so you'll have no reason to enter the kitchen or handle food.

, It is a good idea to start with a short amount of time and see how it feels before you launch into a 24 hour fast for the first time ever. Try an 8-hour fast on a weekend day when you don't have much to do. Skip breakfast and lunch (or have broth for lunch), and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Finish the evening with a light, healthy meal.


During the fast, be aware of how you feel hour by hour. Does the fast make you feel weak or ill, or do you enjoy the lighter feeling of not digesting food?
Most of us need to work through out the day, but at any moment consider taking a nap. A nap will do you many health benefits and increase your metabolism.
Reflect on how you feel the next day, since the benefits of a fast are often not felt until after it is over. Do you have more energy? Do you feel refreshed and ready to try again, or does the thought of doing another fast fill you with dread? Let this short fast help you make your decision to either make fasting a regular part of your life or resolve not to do it again.

, At first you'll just feel hungry and thirsty, but fasting soon has other effects on your body and mood. You may be cranky, angry, or sad for the first few days as your body releases toxins and deals with cravings. As you deal with the inevitable physical and mental pain that comes with fasting, remind yourself why you wanted to fast in the first place, and focus on crossing the finish line.


If you're fasting for spiritual reasons, turn your thoughts toward the higher power or religious teachings that made you feel drawn to the act of fasting. Try reading the religious text that inspired you to fast, or reading accounts of other people's fasting trials. You may also draw strength from talking to other people who are fasting for the same reason.
If you're fasting for health reasons, imagine the toxins that have accumulated in your body getting flushed away. By fasting, you're giving your body the chance to purify itself before you begin eating food again. Read up on the medical benefits of fasting to help you stay the course.


, Fasting can lead to fantasies of large banquet tables laden with silver platters full of all the food you can't eat. Daydreaming will only increase your cravings, so find ways to get your mind on something besides ice cream and hamburgers.


Spending time with a friend or a family member doing something unrelated to eating is a great distraction, as long as he or she knows not to suggest that you go out to dinner afterward.
Exercising is normally a good way to distract yourself from eating, but in this case it might make you hungrier. Go for a light walk or plan an excursion that doesn't require burning too many calories.
Don't watch too much TV, since the commercials may tempt you with images of food and people eating. Try reading a book or working on a craft project instead.
Sleep as much as you want. Sleeping time counts as fasting time, so if you're doing a multi-day fast, getting plenty of rest can help you get through the hunger pangs.


, If you're fasting for more than a few hours, keeping track of your progress can help you stay on track. Write down how you feel at each stage of the fast. You'll be able to look back and see how far you've come, and it will give you incentive to keep going.


Pay attention to patterns that might clue you in to ways you can make fasting easier. For example, if you felt strong cravings after taking a walk, try not to burn as many calories through exercise.
Write out your feelings if you feel cranky or angry. Journaling is a great way to get negative emotions out of your system, and it might help you keep them at bay long enough to finish the fast.
Be open to good feelings, too. Some people report feeling euphoric after a few days of juice fasting, once the toxins have left their system. Keep note of the day when your feelings start turning from negative to positive, and your body begins feeling the healing effects of fasting.


, If you begin feeling weak, dizzy, lightheaded or nauseated during the fast, drink water and eat something immediately. Continuing the fast may compromise your health. See a doctor to determine what went wrong before you try fasting again.


Don't force yourself to fast through extreme feelings of anger or cravings that make you feel sick. Instead of fasting, you may need to wean yourself off of the foods that affect you this way.
If you simply don't like the feeling of fasting, there's no reason you can't stop. You can always try again, so don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't work out the first time.


, Drink plenty of water before breaking a fast to make sure your body is hydrated and ready to take food again. Even if you did a liquid fast, the first thing you should do on the day you're ready to break it is have a glass or two of water.

, Don't break a fast by feasting on heavy food, since your body has grown used to taking in very little. Your stomach will have shrunk, so you may not be able to take in much at first. Have a small meal of healthy vegetables and some protein to get your body acclimated to digesting food again.


Avoid eating food that's difficult to digest, like beans and other legumes. Save these for a few days after you've completed the fast.
Don't drink alcohol the day you complete a fast, since your tolerance will be very low and it might have an adverse effect on your body.
Some fasts, especially religious fasts, require that you break the fast with certain foods. Conduct research beforehand so you know how you're supposed to break your fast.

, When you first start eating solid food, your body may produce gas or diarrhea until it gets used to digesting food again. Don't be alarmed if you have an upset stomach for a few hours after reintroducing food to your system.

, Whether you fasted to lose weight, to cleanse your system, or to get in touch with your spiritual side, you can congratulate yourself on a job well done when the fast is complete. You may feel the following positive effects when your fast is over:


An increased energy level.
An improvement in your mood.
Reduced cravings for sugar, caffeine and alcohol.

Continue with your workout diet for the rest of the day.",How to Eat After a Workout," Your BMR is what you use to calculate your calorie intake. It is based on your age, height, weight, and gender. Most calorie calculators use the Harris-Benedict equation to determine how many calories you should be eating every day.If you are a man, your BMR is equal to: 65 + (6.2 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years)
If you’re a woman, your BMR is equal to: 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.3 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years);
, Calorie calculators also factor in your level of activity. If you are very active, for example, with hard exercise almost every day of the week, you may need to consume more calories than if you lead a more sedentary lifestyle, where you do little to no activity. The five different levels of activity are:Sedentary: You have a desk job where you sit all day long and do little to no exercise every week.
Lightly active: You do light exercise or play sports, one to three days a week.
Moderately active: You do moderate exercise or play sports, three to five days a week.
Very active: You do hard, intense exercise or play sports, six to seven days a week.
Extremely active: You do intense daily exercise or sports twice a day, and have a physical labor job or are doing a training camp for football or another contact sport.

, You can put all of the above information in calorie counting tool that will estimate your required calories per a day, based on your BMR, available here. Once you have your estimated calorie intake, consider how you will reduce or increase your calorie intake per a day based on your fitness goals.If you are trying to lose weight, reduce your estimated calorie intake by 500 per a day. Balance your fitness plan by eating 250 calories less a day and exercising enough to burn 250 calories. For example, walking or running 2.5 miles a day. When planning your meals, cut back on portion sizes to reduce the amount of calories you consume by 250.
If you are trying to gain weight, eat 500 calories more per day and limit your cardio exercises. Focus on strength training, involving free weights, to add lean muscle mass. You should also be eating at least 1 gram per pound of body weight of protein and get plenty of rest to recover after your workouts.
Always start by reducing or increasing your calorie intake a little at a time, no more than 500 calories either way. This will prevent your body from going into shock and ensure you are consuming enough calories to allow your body to function., Use your estimated BMR, minus or plus 500 calories based on your fitness goals, to create meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as post workout meals. Always eat at least three meals a day, and balance out the protein, vegetables, and healthy fats on your plate to maintain a healthy diet.


For example, you might be a 28 year old female who weighs 140 pounds and is very active. You do intense exercise seven days a week, with one hour at the gym every other day and recreational soccer two days a week. Your estimated calorie intake, based on your BMR, is around 2,050 a day. If you are looking to lose weight, you would remove 500 calories by subtracting 250 calories from your daily intake and burning 250 more calories during your exercise routine. You would now consume 1,800 calories a day and add more exercise to your existing routine to burn 250 extra calories.
You could break down your 1,800 calories a day further into each meal, so 600 per a meal (600 x 3) or you could allot more calories for lunch and dinner and less calories for breakfast (500 for breakfast, 650 for lunch or your post-workout meal, and 650 for dinner).
Be sure that you are not putting too many calories after your workout. You need to make sure that you have enough calories left for the rest of your day.

, You should eat a meal that balances protein and carbohydrates within two hours of your workout. If you are training as an athlete and are doing a weight training workout, you should eat a meal high in nutrient rich carbs right after you have finished your workout. Your body is in recovery mode after a workout and this will help your body recover and will improve your muscle strength. Possible post workout meals include:Greek yogurt with fruit like blueberries or raspberries: This meal is full of protein and low on calories, so you won’t risk going over your daily calorie intake per a day.
A peanut butter and banana sandwich: This easy meal is great for recovering after a workout, as it’s packed with carbs and is easy to digest.
Tuna and crackers: A handful of whole grain crackers with a can of yellowfin tuna makes a great protein-rich post-workout meal that only 300 calories.
Low-fat chocolate milk and crackers: Chocolate milk is a great source of protein and carbs, as well as water to replace the fluids you lost during your workout, plus calcium, and sugar. These ingredients will help you recover quickly from your workout. The crackers will give your body some extra carbs that are not too heavy or fattening and will help your body digest the nutrients from the chocolate milk.
Grilled chicken with brown rice or vegetables: This is a nutrient-rich meal that contains protein and carbohydrates, but won’t make you feel bloated. The vegetables are also good for your overall health and are good sides to protein-rich grilled chicken.
Whole wheat pasta with meatballs: This is another high-protein meal that won’t lead to indigestion or bloating. Make the meatballs with lean beef or chicken to keep the protein from getting too fatty.

, Skip the french fries, cheeseburgers, chili-dogs, and pizza, as they will add fat to your body’s fat stores and slow down your digestion.While fats do sustain energy, they are less effective when eaten before and after workouts. This is due to the fact that they tend to be high calorie and prevent the body from tapping into it's own fat stores for energy.


You should also skip salty snacks like pretzels and chips, as they can lower your levels of potassium. Potassium is an electrolyte and and essential mineral that helps your cells function. Don’t deplete your potassium levels with salty snacks, as your body needs to try to replenish as many electrolytes as possible post-workout.
Though it may seem like raw vegetables are good for post workout recovery, they are lacking in enough nutrients to give you the protein and carbs you need. If you have raw veggies, eat them with a protein source like hummus, a yogurt dip, or a nut butter.
Milk chocolate bars and pastries should also be avoided, as they are full of empty calories that will not speed up your body’s recovery. You may feel a burst of energy after eating a milk chocolate bar, but this will soon fade and your body will crave more substantial sources of protein.

, Supplements such as creatine can help your body recover from an intense body building workout, especially if you are doing high-intensity weight training.These supplements (about 5 grams) can be dissolved into water and consumed right after your workout.Studies have shown that consuming creatine after your workout can increase your muscle strength and reduce the fat stores in your body.
Protein shakes are a great way to consume a high amount of protein quickly after a workout.

, Drinking lots of water post-workout will help your body recover and stay hydrated. You should only have sports drinks if your workout required you to sweat out a lot of electrolytes or you are doing intense training for more than 60 minutes. Water, coupled with a banana for potassium, is the best option for quenching your thirst and replenishing the electrolytes you released through your sweat.Downing sugary fruit drinks or soda after a workout can slow down your metabolism and cause you to gain weight, not lose it.

, Maintain your estimated calorie intake by following your workout meal plan. Try to have a post-workout meal that fits within your calorie breakdown for the day. Avoid overeating after working out or indulging in cheat foods, as this can lead to poor recovery, low energy, and possible weight gain.

If you consume large quantities of sugar or have been consuming it for a long period of time, going cold turkey might come with more intense withdrawal symptoms. It might be best to slowly remove sugar from your diet over a few weeks.
If you only consume small amounts of sugar you may be able to go cold turkey with minimal symptoms.
If you choose to taper down the amount of sugar you're including in your diet, make sure to be honest about your choices. Don't indulge in a sweet treat just to have a source of sugar in your day.;
, Letting go of sugar may not always be an easy task. In addition, finding foods to replace sugar in diet may also be difficult or time consuming. Start journaling your foods, diet plan, and how you're feeling as you cut sugar out of your diet.


Come up with a strategy and make notes in your journal. You might start by writing down a food diary to get an idea of how much sugar you consume in any given day or week. Then you can start making a plan of how to reduce sugar in your diet.
Also include different healthy swaps you are thinking about using. You might need to try a few different things before you find something that works.
You can also include notes on your mood or how you're feeling about your progress. Journaling is a great way to manage any stress related to this task., Like many food addictions, when you give-up the offending food, you may have some side effects. These symptoms are normal and to be expected.Remember that sugar is essentially a drug. With any drug, quitting can lead to withdrawal and cravings. These will pass but the initial withdrawal phase may be a bit tricky.


How long you experience withdrawal symptoms depends on how much sugar you've been eating each day and for how long you've been consuming sugar. The more sugar you've been consuming and the longer you've been doing it may mean more intense or long-lasting side effects.In general, for the first week or two after giving up sugar, you might feel nauseous, have a headache, and feel cranky. Your body has come to rely on its daily sugar boost, and taking that away will have an effect until you get used to it.
Journal about your symptoms and write down positive thoughts of giving up sugar to get you through the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. It'll be worth the discomfort in the end, when your mood levels out and you feel healthier and more energetic than you did when you were addicted to sugar.

, You might dream of cupcakes, ice cream, and candy for the first few weeks, but rest assured that your cravings will eventually go away. In the meantime, curb them by trying the following:


Dilute sweet beverages. Mix regular sodas with water or unsweetened seltzer. Dilute juices and other sweetened drinks with water as well. Keep doing so until you feel comfortable switching to only water or other sugar-free beverages.
Reach for fruit. If you're craving a sweet treat, trying reaching for sweet fruit. Good ideas to try include: pineapple, mango, and bananas as these are slightly more sweet than other fruits.
Stick to low-calorie. If you're really craving something sweet and fruit or other tricks won't do it, go for a calorie-controlled option. Sticking to a treat that's less than 150 calories is a smart move. Try buying small, portioned controlled items to help keep you in control.

, Giving up sugar isn't easy, and it can help to have support from other people who are going through the same thing. Instead of trying to do it all alone, sign up for a group program or support group.


Groups are either in person or online. You'll be able to share motivational stories and tips for making the process go more smoothly. It's nice to have people with whom you can share your achievements, too!
Tell your friends and family what you're up to. The fact that you're giving up sugar may have an impact on other people you regularly eat with. Explain to them why you're giving it up, what foods you can no longer eat and what foods you can. Ask them to help you on your journey to giving up sugar, and perhaps even join you.
Telling others you have set a goal to give up sugar gives you accountability and support. It also lessens the risk that friends and loved ones will offer you sugar-filled items.

, Birthday parties, holidays, and other special occasions are celebrated with sugary treats, and it can feel next to impossible not to indulge. If you overindulge, that's OK. Get right back up and start back on your sugar-free diet as soon as you can.


Try journaling about what you ate and why you ate it. Many times it might be stress or other emotional factors playing a part into why you slipped up.
If you can, limit yourself to just one piece or one cookie so you don't end up throwing yourself off too much. Afterward, get right back on your sugar-free diet.
You might experience increased cravings for a few days afterward, so you'll have to be extra careful to keep sugar away.

, Eliminating sugar requires paying very close attention to what you buy at the grocery store since sugar is added to many types of food.


The nutrition fact panel will let you know how many grams of sugar is in each serving of your food. However, this doesn't tell you if it's natural or added sugar.
Be mindful when you shop! You most likely expect to find added sugars in something like cookies, but you might be surprised to see it's also commonly added to savory foods like salad dressing, bread, and tomato sauce. Check labels carefully and avoid foods that contain sugar.
Read the ingredient list to figure out if there's any added sugar to your foods. Remember, some food will have sugar listed on the nutrition fact panel, but there is no added sugar to the products. For example, plain yogurt or unsweetened applesauce both contain naturally occurring sugar.
Added sugars include white sugar, brown sugar, beet sugar, cane sugar, molasses, agave syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, turbinado, honey, maple syrup, agave syrup, fruit juice concentrate and many more., Added sugars that are mixed with food to sweeten them and contain no nutritional value on their own. Naturally-occurring sugars in fruit and milk come with vitamins, minerals, and fiber making them much more nutritious.


Naturally-occurring sugars include fructose (found in fruit) and lactose (found in milk). All fruit, fruit products (like unsweetened applesauce) and dairy products (like yogurt, milk or cottage cheese) contain varying amounts of naturally occurring sugars.
You can make a variety of healthier swaps by substituting foods that contain natural sugar for added sugar. When you're craving something sweet, go for naturally sweet items like fruit or yogurt.

, Sugar is commonly added to processed and packaged foods to improve the taste, texture, and shelf life.Frozen food, packaged snacks, canned soup, sauces, salad dressings, and marinades often have added sugar. Try making some of these items from scratch if you can.
Go for unsweetened and plain varieties whenever possible. For example, consume unsweetened applesauce or plain yogurt. Flavored items generally contain added sugars.
Even fruit can be loaded with sugar when it's processed. Fruit juice has been stripped of fiber and water that helps you feel full. If you're including fruit in your diet, go for whole fruit., One of the most common and obvious sources of added sugars are in foods like candy, cookies, cakes, pastries, and other dessert-type foods. Most know that there is a large quantity of added sugars in these foods when they're made. Giving up on these can help cut out a large portion of added sugar in your diet.


As mentioned before, you can choose to cut out these foods cold turkey or taper them slowly out of your diet.
If you're going cold turkey, you may not be interested in healthy swaps. If you're tapering them out of your diet, you may find it helpful to plan some naturally sweetened, healthy alternatives into your day.

, Sweet treats provide a lot of enjoyment in our diets. When you're trying to give up sugar, it'll be helpful to find low-sugar or naturally sweetened alternatives when you're in the mood to indulge.


Use fruit instead. You can try a small bowl of fruit plain or sprinkled with a little cinnamon after dinner. If you're allowing yourself a small amount of sugar, you can try serving your fruit with a small amount of low-fat whipped cream or dipping fruit into dark chocolate (which contains small amounts of sugar).
If you like baked goods like muffins, pancakes or sweet breads, you can try using sugar-free baking techniques. Many recipes can be made with unsweetened applesauce, sweet potato puree or pumpkin puree for a naturally sweetened sugar source.
If you don't like cooking or preparing foods, you may want to consider buying low sugar treats. Many foods that are made for diabetics or are diet foods may be helpful. Do note that these may contain higher amounts of artificial sweeteners.

, Alcohol also contains sugar. In addition, it doesn't come with any nutritional benefits. Eliminate alcohol altogether or stick to ""light"" or low-carb options.


All alcoholic beverages have some sugar. It's not just the sweetened mixed drinks like margaritas.
If you're in the mood for a beer, choose light or low-carb for the least amount of calories and sugar.
If you're in the mood for a glass of wine, make it a ""spritzer."" This is a mix of wine and seltzer which cuts the sugar and calories in half.
If you typically want a mixed drink, ask for unsweetened mixers like seltzer or diet sodas to help cut down on sugar and calories.

, If you are going to include some sugars, it might be wise to choose more naturally occurring, less processed forms of sugar.


Try honey, agave syrup, molasses, or maple syrup for a touch of added sweetness.
All of these sweeteners are natural and may even contain some vitamins and antioxidants.Make sure that if you choose to use these types of sweeteners that they are not mixtures. For example, some companies sell honey that's a mixture of honey and corn syrup. Make you purchase 100% honey or 100% maple syrup.

, It's easy to consume hidden sugar in restaurants, since the meals don't come with nutrition labels for you to examine. You can always ask the server to tell you what's in a dish, but it's often better to have a good strategy for ordering food with the least amount of sugar. Try doing the following to keep your restaurant meals sugar-free:


Get your salads dressed with plain oil and vinegar, rather than choosing a pre-made salad dressing. Also, always ask for dressings to be served on the side.
Ask for main dishes to be made without sauces and gravies that might have added sugar. Again, ask for these to be served on the side.
When in doubt, order steamed vegetables or plain grilled meats instead of casseroles and other mixed dishes that contain a lot of ingredients. Look for the most simple items on the menu. These will most likely have the least amount of added ingredients.
For dessert, opt for a plain bowl of fruit or skip it altogether.

, Since many people are giving up sugars and have become more health conscious, scientists have developed different artificial sweeteners as low-calorie replacements. Aspartame, saccharin, sugar alcohols, and other sweeteners have a variety of different side effects and could potentially be harmful to your health.Studies have shown that when you're trying to give up sugar, the sweet taste of artificial sweeteners may make you crave sugar even more.Avoid processed food that's been sweetened with artificial sweeteners e.g. diet drinks and any typically sweet item that's labeled sugar-free, like candy, ice cream, cake, etc.
Artificial sugar might be listed as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, neotame, sucralose, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol.Avoid these if you'd like.

Understand the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber.,
Substitute soluble fiber heavy foods with insoluble fiber heavy foods.,
Use dried beans, rather than canned beans, in your meals.,
Avoid cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage.,
Add fiber to your diet slowly.,
Eat 20 to 35 grams (1.2 oz) of fiber a day if you are an adult.,
Drink water with every meal.",How to Decrease Gas Caused by Fiber in Diet1," It’s important to understand the two forms of fiber, and which foods contain soluble or insoluble fiber.Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material, which can lower your cholesterol and blood glucose levels. It also slows down your digestion and is more likely to cause gas. It is found in foods like oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. Consume more water to help absorb soluble fiber. This is important when taking any fiber supplement as well.
Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. It promotes movement in your digestive tract, so it accelerates your digestion. As a result, it causes you to have less gas than soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, green beans, and potatoes.;
, It’s important to balance your fiber consumption so you eat both insoluble and soluble fiber sources. This will help you stay healthy and get enough fiber in your diet.But to cut down on gas, try substituting certain soluble fiber foods with insoluble fiber foods.For example, oat bran contains mostly soluble fiber, and wheat bran contains more insoluble fiber. So, regular wheat bran cereal or bran muffins may cause less gas than oat bran cereal or oat bran muffins., Beans are known to be major sources of gas, but dried beans may cause less gas, post meal. Soaking the dried beans overnight before you eat them can lessen the impact of beans on your digestive system. , These foods are great sources of fiber, but they can cause gas and bloating. If possible, limit your consumption of these foods to once a month, or substitute these foods for other vegetables that are less gas-inducing.Leafy green vegetables like spinach, collard greens, and lettuce are mostly packed with insoluble fiber, so they are a good source of nutrients and should cause less gas.
Avoid raw vegetables, as they are harder for your body to break down and can lead to gas. Steam or cook vegetables before you eat them., The bacteria in your stomach and small intestine need time to catch up with your fiber consumption. Adding too much fiber too quickly can cause gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. Increase your fiber intake about 5 grams (0.2 oz) per a day, over a period of 1-2 weeks, to allow your body time to adjust.You may experience bloating and gas at the beginning of your fiber intake. But over time, your body will adjust to the fiber and you should see a reduction in bloating and gas.Remember to increase fiber with water at the same time. Increase water intake anytime you add fiber to your diet to prevent constipation.

, The recommended fiber intake for older children, adolescents, and adults is no more than 35 grams (1.2 oz) of fiber a day.Younger children will not be able to eat enough calories to achieve this amount of fiber in their daily diet. But you should introduce whole grains, fresh fruits, and leafy greens to your child’s diet so they can build up their tolerance for fiber over time.

, Water helps to push the fiber through your digestive system. Staying hydrated also prevents the fiber from hardening and obstructing your intestine. Dehydration and a build up of fiber in your body can lead to some uncomfortable moments in the bathroom.You should also stay hydrated if you drink coffee throughout the day. Caffeine is a diuretic that pulls fluids from your body and makes you urinate. This can lead to dehydration. For every 1 cup of caffeinated fluid you consume, you should drink 2 glasses of decaffeinated fluids. Too much caffeine in your body, coupled with a fiber rich diet, can lead to constipation and gas."

Use a product like Beano.,
Talk to your doctor before you take fiber supplements.,
See a doctor if you experience severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody stools.",How to Decrease Gas Caused by Fiber in Diet2," Beano is an over-the-counter medication that contains a natural enzyme to prevent bloating and gas caused by fiber intake. Beano works to reduce the amount of gas the fiber you eat releases, cutting down on the amount of gas you release after a meal.In several studies, Beano has been shown to be effective at alleviating bloating and gas after a fiber heavy meal., Daily use of fiber supplements like Metamucil or Konsyl can be a very effective way to maintain a healthy fiber intake. However, the best way to receive fiber is always through food first. You should check with your doctor before you add fiber supplements to your diet, especially if you are taking other medication that could interact with these supplements.Start with a small amount of fiber supplements so your body has time to adjust and you do not get too bloated or gassy. Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day.
Fiber supplements can decrease your body’s ability to absorb certain medications, like aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) and carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol). These supplements can also reduce your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may need to adjust your medications or your insulin if you have diabetes and want to take fiber supplements.

, Bouts of excessive bloating, belching, and gas often resolve on their own, or they will lessen as your body adjusts to your fiber intake. But you should talk to your doctor if your symptoms don’t improve or you experience severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, unintended weight loss, or chest pain.These symptoms could be signs of an underlying digestive condition or intestinal issue.

Learn about the concept of clean eating.,
Evaluate your eating habits.,
Identify your unclean habits and determine how you can change them.,
Make a plan to switch your diet so it’s cleaner healthier for life.,
Talk to a doctor or dietitian about your eating habits.,
Be aware of proper nutrition.,
Clean out your kitchen.,
(Re)stock your kitchen.,
Make changes to your diet gradually.,
Plan meals as often as possible.,
Allow yourself cheat days.,
Eat clean at restaurants.",How to Eat Clean for Life," Clean eating sounds like a fairly simple concept, but it entails some specific conditions about how food is processed. Learning about these conditions can help you to change your diet and eat clean for life.


By definition, clean eating involves consuming foods in their most natural state.Changing the natural form of the food is also considered processing food, even if it is minimal. For example, steaming broccoli or mashing apples into applesauce would be a form of processing food.;
, You won’t be able to eat clean unless you have an idea of your current dining patterns. Evaluating how you eat will help you identify good and bad habits as well as foods or behaviors that trigger unhealthy outcomes.The best way to evaluate your eating habits is to keep a food diary for two to four weeks. Write down everything you eat for this time, including snacks or foods you eat in passing. You might want to note how processed or refined your foods are (e.g. store-bought white bread instead of homemade whole grain).
It’s a good idea to make a note of how you’re feeling each day. Write down how you feel before and after meals, which can help you identify triggers for unhealthy habits more easily.
Note what is clean in your diet from your diary. For example, “I eat a lot of healthy salads,” or “I consume a large number of industrially processed foods.”
Highlight the whole and real foods that you consume. This will serve to help keep these habits as you move forward. Recognizing your successes can encourage you to eat healthy.

, After two weeks, you should be able to identify unclean foods and if there are any specific triggers for your eating them. Figure out how you can change these habits with elimination or substitution.See if there is anything that is causing you to eat unclean. Do you go out for happy hour and eat bar food instead of a proper dinner? Do you eat more processed foods when you’re stressed or tired?, Once you’ve identified your eating habits, create a plan to continue your healthy patterns and replace unclean behaviors. Consider making a lifestyle plan that includes clean eating, exercise, and time to rest and relax.


As you develop your plan, incorporate your clean habits from the food diary. You could create a plan around three solid, clean meals and two wholesome snacks a day.Your plan should include meals that meet all of your nutritional needs to sustain your health and well-being. For example, you need to make sure you’re getting enough protein, vitamins, and fiber through foods such as lean meats or nuts, and fruits and vegetables.Aim to eat food that are either processed minimally or that require little cooking or changing their form.
Make sure to allow time for physical activity, such as walking or jogging, for at least thirty minutes a day. You’ll also want to make sure to include time for rest and relaxation, such as reading a book. These will help reinforce your clean eating habits and contribute to your overall well-being.Be aware places or situations where you are more likely to “sin,” such as walking past candy dishes, donut packages at work, or simply just feeling bored. Actively try to avoid eating during these situations or divert yourself if that’s easier. Keep clean snacks such as apples or cut vegetables at your desk to help avoid derailing your clean habits.
Consider allowing yourself one day to cheat and eat foods that aren’t a part of your clean plan. One day of conscious cheating may keep you from bad behaviors on other days., If you’re unsure of how to eat more cleanly life, consider talking to your doctor or a registered dietician about how to replace processed foods with natural choices. They can often help you identify problem areas and develop the most reasonable eating plan for your lifestyle.


Your doctor or local hospital can suggest a registered dietician or you can find one yourself using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics online search tool at http://www.eatright.org/find-an-expert.
If you don’t want to consult a doctor or dietician, there are many quality resources on the Internet that can help you develop the best eating plan for yourself.

, Informing yourself about the basics of proper nutrition can help you understand what your body needs to be healthy for life. It will also help you identify the best clean foods for your eating plan.


You will get proper nutrition if you incorporate clean foods from the five food groups every day. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.You need 1-1.5 cups of fruit per day. You can get this from eating whole fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries, or from drinking 100% fruit juice.Make sure to vary the fruits you choose so that you get a range of nutrients and don’t process them in any way. For example, eating a cup of pure berries is much cleaner than eating berries on top of a cake.
You need 2.5-3 cups of vegetables per day. You can get this from eating whole vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, or peppers, or from drinking 100% vegetable juice.Make sure to vary the vegetables you choose so that you get a range of nutrients.
Fruits and vegetables are easily incorporated into a variety of dishes including soups and stews, stir fry, or even something as simple as a cup of Greek yogurt with fresh fruit for a dessert.
You need between 5-8 ounces of grains per day, of which ½ should be whole grains. You can get grains and whole grains from foods such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta or bread, oatmeal, or cereal.Remember to keep these foods as minimally processed as possible. For example, brown rice and whole wheat bread are far less processed than white rice or bread because the germ hasn’t been separated from the rest of the grain.You need 5-6.5 ounces of protein per day.You can get protein from lean meats including beef, pork, or poultry; cooked beans; eggs; peanut butter; or nuts and seeds.You need 2-3 cups, or 12 oz., of dairy per day.You can get dairy from cheese, yogurt, milk, soymilk, or even ice cream.Avoid excessive amounts of sodium in your diet, which is prevalent in mass-processed foods.

, Look around your kitchen and remove unclean and unnatural items. This will help reinforce your clean eating habits. Half the battle here is removing tempting junk foods from your environment. Your home should be a safe zone full of healthy options.


You don’t have to throw away every item from your kitchen. Get rid of junk and overly processed food including chips, cookies, candy, and cakes, or pre-made or frozen meals.Consider donating any unused foods to a local food pantry.

, Once you’ve had a chance to remove unclean foods from your kitchen, restock it with healthy and clean options. Having nutrient-rich and clean options on hand will help reinforce healthy eating habits and help you avoid unhealthy patterns.


You may find that keeping clean foods requires you to food shop more often. If this isn’t feasible, consider options such as frozen fruits and vegetables, which are as healthy as fresh food and minimally processed. These can easily be incorporated into any dish such as a stir fry or Greek yogurt.Make sure to stock non-perishable whole grains such as whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, brown rice, so you can make easy, go-to meals in a pinch.Purchase dairy products such as yogurt, milk, or cheese to ensure you get protein and calcium.Buy protein-rich foods such as beans, nuts, and fresh meat.Stock healthy oils such as olive, walnut, and sesame instead of butter or margarine.Keep a variety of herbs and spices on hand to jazz up any meal and offer different flavors depending on what foods you crave.

, While you may be excited to completely overhaul what you’re eating, it’s important to gradually make changes to your overall diet. This will help you stick to eating clean for life.


Aim to eat clean at every meal, but you can slowly replace processed foods. For example, if you eat white rice with every meal, switch to brown rice and then gradually add more vegetables and less rice.
Remember to allow yourself to cheat occasionally so that you stay on track., Planning your meals in advance will help you to avoid regressing towards unclean habits. It will also help ensure that you’re getting plenty of nutrients and may even save you money.For example, plan your breakfasts to help start off your day on the right foot. If you don’t have lunch meetings, packing a clean and unprocessed lunch can help you avoid buying unhealthy fast foods. If you do have a lunch meeting, order the least processed and most natural food on the menu. Salads are a good and clean choice.

, No person is perfect and sometimes you crave unhealthy foods. Allow yourself occasional cheat days to enjoy junk food or foods you wouldn’t normally eat on your plan.There is increasing evidence that allowing yourself to cheat occasionally and consciously will help you maintain your diet in the long run because you’re not denying yourself anything.You may even find you don’t unclean foods as often when you’re eating a clean diet.
Never berate yourself or let mistakes or cheat days derail your overall healthy habits. Setbacks are normal., Eating out can cause a major setback for many people’s otherwise clean diets because of processed, high fat and calorie dishes. Consciously avoiding certain foods and making good choices at restaurants can help you reinforce your good eating habits.


Avoid unclean pitfalls like breadbaskets, fried foods, or dishes in heavy sauces such as fettuccine alfredo.
Salads or steamed vegetables and steaks are good choices of minimally processed, clean foods.
Avoid buffets, which are often filled with unhealthy and processed food choices and can encourage you to overeat.Have whole fruits for dessert, which are healthy and clean."

Use the 20-20-20 rule.,
Blink more.,
Roll your eyes.,
Scan the room.,
Do some glances.,
Try palming.",How to Avoid Eye Strain While Working at a Computer1," When you are working at the computer, rest your eyes for at least 20 seconds by looking at something 20 feet (6.1 m) away after using the computer for 20 minutes. If you have a window nearby, looking at something outdoors is a great option. Alternatively, you can move your eyes from something close to something far away, switching between the two every 10 seconds at least ten times for a little eye “workout.”;
, Some eye strain occurs because you tend to blink less when focusing on something, like your computer screen. Try to be conscious of your blinking while you work, and do it more often., Closing and then rolling your eyes can help lubricate them. It also helps to relax straining muscles.


Close your eyes and roll them around in a circular motion. Roll them clockwise, then counter-clockwise. This not only helps relax your eyes but also feels good., After a long period focusing on the screen, take a break to look around the room slowly, keeping your eyes constantly in motion and looking at things that are varying distances from you., Close your eyes and glance up as far as you can without discomfort. Hold your eyes still for a moment, then look down, eyes still closed.Repeat a few times and then rest your eyes for a moment.
Next, keeping your eyes closed like before, look to the right and the left. Repeat., The eye muscle is like a spring that should not be over-extended for long periods of time. Otherwise, it's ability to recoil can weaken. To prevent this, there are several things you can do to relax your eyes. Palming involves resting and warming your eyes using friction heat. Here's how it's done:Rub your palms together to create some heat.
Close your eyes.
Put one palm gently over each eye and rest them like this for a few minutes.
Re-warm your palms as necessary.
Don't push into or jab your eyes too hard, so you don't damage them.

Reposition your screen.,
Reposition your face.,
Adjust the brightness and contrast.,
Clean your screen.,
Adjust the lighting.,
Reduce glare.,
Upgrade your screen.,
Reposition your work materials.",How to Avoid Eye Strain While Working at a Computer2," The angle at which you look at your screen can affect the amount of strain on your eyes. Start by adjusting your screen position to slightly lower than eye level.Specifically, the top of the screen/monitor should be aligned with your eyes, when looking straight ahead. Try tilting the screen/monitor at different angles and heights while you're sitting there and it may help reduce eye fatigue.
This angle keeps your neck in a more natural position and results in less work for your eyes.

, Try to position your face as far as you can from the monitor: 20-40 inches or 50-100 cm is about the right distance.This may seem like it will make your eyes work harder, but eyes are relaxed at this distance.
You may a need larger screen or bigger font sizes to read your screen at this distance.

, Turn down the brightness, turn up the contrast. This will make your screen easier on the eyes.Screens that are too bright are hard on the eyes.
When there's not enough contrast between blacks and whites on your computer screen this is also hard on your eyes. This is because they have a harder time distinguishing between different items. This can add to eye strain., Cleaning your screen removes electrostatic particles that may be emitted from the computer screen. These particles can push dust toward your eyes, causing irritation and strain. Cleaning your screen can also reduce glare.Wipe down your screen daily with an anti-static solution sprayed onto a cloth.

, You should try to create an environment that has lighting similar to that of your monitor. The ideal workspace will have soft lights, limited natural light, no fluorescent lighting, and surfaces that don't reflect too much light.It is important to get the right amount of lux or light that passes through a surface. Lux is the standard unit of illumination. For ordinary office work you should illuminate the room at about 500 lux.The packaging on your light bulbs should help you select the right amount of light regarding lux.
Switching your bulbs and adjusting window blinds in your office may cut down on your eyestrain.
If you can't control the lighting, adjust the colors on your monitor. This is also known as adjusting your color temperature. Often, turning down the blue a little can reduce eye strain.On Windows computers, you can adjust the color using the control panel.
There is software available that automatically adjusts your monitor colors based on the time of day to compensate for changes in the natural lighting.One such software is called f.lux.This can make it easier to view a monitor screen in dim light or at night., Harsh glare off your computer screen can also strain the eyes.If you can't control the lighting in your work environment, consider buying an anti-glare screen for your monitor or anti-glare glasses for you to wear.


Anti-glare screens have the added benefit of increasing privacy. They make it harder for anyone not directly in front of your screen to see what's there.
These are easier to get to for desktop computers than laptops.

, Consider purchasing a high-resolution monitor. These are often easier on the eyes.


Older monitors tend to flicker more, whereas the new high-resolution models provide a more consistent illumination. Flickering can increase eye strain.Older monitors also have a slower refresh rate, causing your eyes to constantly readjust every time image refreshes on your screen., Eye shifting can increase eye strain and frustration unless performed as an exercise. To avoid this, buy a stand for your books and papers so your resources can be easily located. Put the stand directly next to the screen, so your eyes aren't shifting as much.Constantly shifting eyes means making your eyes focus and refocus on different reading materials.
When objects are only a few inches away from each other, your eyes don't need to refocus.If you can master ""touch-typing"" so that you don't need to look at your keys or screen, this is even better. You can keep your eyes on your other materials while typing, which cuts down on screen time.

Take a break.,
Get some glasses.,
See a doctor.",How to Avoid Eye Strain While Working at a Computer3," If you are experiencing eye strain which is severely uncomfortable or affecting your vision, step immediately away from your computer and any bright lights. If possible, go outdoors into natural light. Alternately, dimming the lights indoors and giving yourself a break from all bright lights may feel comforting.

, If you need glasses but don't have them, or if your glasses aren't the right prescription, this can increase eye strain. Make sure you've got the right prescription so your eyes don't have to work any harder than necessary.


If you wear bifocals, you may tilt your head at an awkward angle when using your computer. Talk to your optometrist to see if progressive lenses may work better.
Computer glasses can be helpful, but an eye doctor must prescribe them. They work by reducing the amount of effort required by eyes to focus, thus reducing eye strain.In addition, purchasing lenses with an anti-reflective coating will help cut down on computer glare. There are plain, nonprescription lenses with this coating available for those who don't need vision correction.
Look into glasses with tinting that is specific to computer use. Some glasses are tinted a soft pink, which helps with glare, while others have a coating which blocks the blue wavelength known to cause eyestrain. , If your symptoms get worse or do not go away, ask someone to call a doctor for immediate medical help.


If eye strain is an on-going problem for you; it's probably a good idea to see a doctor as soon as possible.You may need an eye exam to make sure that you are wearing the correct prescription of eyeglasses.
You may need to change to bifocals or another type of eyeglass to reduce this problem.
It is also possible you are having a migraine, which is a type of a severe headache you can treat medically. It is also important to diagnose so you can learn what can trigger these migraines. This can help you prevent them."

Drink green tea.,
Skip citrus juices.,
Pick foods by texture.,
Have a cheddar dessert.,
Drink water.",How to Choose Foods That Help Maintain Your Beauty1," A study of Japanese men was done on the effect of green tea on gums. Drinking at least a cup of green tea once a day was shown to ward off gum disease. It may be because green tea contains the antioxidant catechin, which can help reduce inflammation.Remember that green tea has caffeine, which can keep you up at night. Drink it earlier in the day if you find that's a problem for you.
Be aware that drinking too much green tea can have side effects, such as causing stomach discomfort or even an irregular heartbeat. You can sidestep some of these issues by drinking a caffeine-free version.;
, The acid in citrus juices can wreak havoc on your teeth, breaking down the enamel over time. Grapefruit and lemon juice are two of the worst culprits, and soda can also be a problem.


If you still want to drink these juices, try using a straw and then rinsing or brushing your teeth immediately afterwards. A straw will protect the teeth in the front of your mouth to some extent, and the water will help rinse away the acid in the back of your mouth.In addition, skip swishing. If you tend to swish soda or juice around your mouth, you should get into the habit of swallowing more promptly. The longer you hold soda in your mouth, the more damage it can do.

, Foods that are harder to break down, such as crunchy or chewy foods, increase the saliva in your mouth. That saliva is essential to keeping your mouth healthy, as it reduces the amount of acid in your mouth that is created by bacteria.In addition, these types of crunchy foods help remove plaque from your teeth.The acid leads to cavities, which is why it's important to keep the acid level down. Try foods such as carrots, apples, or nuts.However, stay away from sticky, chewy candy. Their stickiness allows the sugar to hang around in the mouth for longer, encouraging the bacteria to create more acid. You should also try to avoid snacks like potato chips and cookies, which can be even worse for your teeth because they stick around for even longer., Eating a bit of hard cheese, such as cheddar, after dinner can help reduce the acid in your mouth. It also has a protein called casein, that protein, along with the calcium and phosphate cheese also provides, can help protect your teeth against cavities. Cheese also increases saliva flow, helping to wash away acids and sugars.Other hard cheeses include Parmesan, Colby, and Gouda.

, Water can help wash away the bacteria and acids that plague your teeth. Try drinking some after every meal. In addition, if your mouth stays too dry, it can increase cavities.Be sure to limit dark drinks like coffee, soda, and red wine that stain teeth.

Try orange and yellow bell peppers, carrots, apricots, sweet potatoes, and yellow squash, for instance. They are high in antioxidants, protecting you against the effects of age. Tomatoes and blueberries are also high in antioxidants.Some of these foods, such as carrots and sweet potatoes, also contain vitamin A, which can also keep your skin healthy and beautiful. Other good sources of vitamin A include lean meats and dairy products., Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, spinach, or collard greens, should be a regular part of your diet anyway, because they are nutritious on so many levels. But they are also great for your skin, given the amount of antioxidants they contain.They are also a good source of Vitamin A, iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C. Maintaining appropriate levels of these nutrients will help hair and scalp healthy.B vitamins are important for keeping your skin healthy., Strawberries are high in vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for many bodily functions, and it also helps build up collagen, reducing the chance of wrinkles in your skin.Try eating 1/2 a cup a day, which provides half of your daily required vitamin C.Other fruits high in vitamin C include citrus fruits such as grapefruit, oranges, and lemons. Others include Kiwi, mangoes, cantaloupe, and watermelon., It is important to include these fats to increase consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. Healthy fats, such as polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats, can help keep your skin younger-looking and more supple. Additionally, they are essential to helping your body take in other nutrients, such as vitamin A and E, that help keep your skin healthy.Some healthy fats include canola oil, olive oil, soybean oil, safflower and sunflower oils. Try cooking with these oils or adding them to salad dressing.If you'd prefer to eat your fats in solid form, try eating fatty fish such as salmon, or nuts, avocados, and seeds.Decrease your consumption of omega-6 fatty acids because they compete with omega-3 fatty acids in the body. Examples of these foods include vegetable oils such as corn oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, and walnut oil., Edamame is a healthy snack, rich in protein. In addition, the isoflavones in it are thought to help preserve collagen, keeping your skin looking young.You can find edamame at most grocery stores in the freezer sections. You can steam a handful at a time in the microwave for a quick afternoon snack.
Remember, you don't eat the outside shell, just the beans inside, though you can find it already shelled to add to salads.

, You hair, nails, and skin are built with the keratin from protein. In fact, your hair may go into stasis by not growing if you aren't getting enough.Pick foods rich in protein, such as fish, milk, eggs, and beans. For instance, meat has 7 grams of protein per ounce.Eggs are also a great source of biotin, which can strengthen brittle nails. If you're deficient in biotin, you may experience hair loss.Meat is also a good source of iron, and your hair needs iron to stay thick and healthy., Fish have omega-3 fatty acids that help your hair grow. Choose fish that contain high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, such as mackerel, tuna, or sardines. Other good choices include fatty fish such as catfish, halibut, salmon, striped sea bass, and albacore tuna.These fish will also help add shine. Make sure to eat fish at least 2 times per week.Instead of fish, you can eat walnuts, canola oil, or tofu, all of which are also high in omega-3 fatty acids., Apples contain quercetin, which can help stave off the harmful parts of the sun's rays that cause skin cancer. Eat Golden Delicious, Cortland, or Monroe for the highest benefit.Tomatoes have lycopene, which has been shown to increase your skin's protection from the sun, especially if you eat it in a concentrated, cooked form, such as tomato paste. Remember, it's still important to wear sunscreen and always use a moisturizer with sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun.

Try half an avocado at lunch.,
Eat soup.,
Increase lean protein in your diet.,
Include rye bread to help with satiety.",How to Choose Foods That Help Maintain Your Beauty3," The healthy fats in avocado can help you stave off hunger. As a result, you'll be less likely to snack in the afternoon.However, you still need to pay attention to how much avocado you eat, as they are high in fat, and therefore high in calories.

, Soups and stews contain more liquid than other foods. Therefore, you fill up faster and stay fuller for longer while consuming fewer calories.Make sure that you choose broth-based soups, not cream-based soups.

, Lean protein is one of the most effective foods for keeping you from being hungry. Try eating fish or chicken or vegetable-based proteins such as lentils or beans.Start your day off with protein to feel fuller throughout the day. Try eating boiled eggs or Greek yogurt for breakfast.

, Whole grain is always best, but when trying to decide between these two whole grains, you might consider choosing rye bread now and then. This grain has been shown to naturally suppress your appetite, and it's even being made into foods such as pasta and oatmeal."

Know the symptoms associated with styes.,
Learn to tell the difference between a stye and a chalazion.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Cure a Stye1," It's unlikely that you won't notice a stye if you have one. Styes commonly cause some level of pain and discomfort. However, because other eye conditions can also be associated with eye pain, it's important to assess the affected eye for telltale stye symptoms if you're experiencing pain. If your symptoms are not consistent with those of a stye, see a doctor to determine treatment options. The following are common initial symptoms of a stye:Redness, tenderness, swelling, and pain in the eyelid.
A small, irritated bump on the eyelid or at the base of an eyelid
Irritation and/or watering of the affected eye
Sensitivity to light
Discomfort when blinking\Sore or a shooting pain when you blink
The presence of a small yellowish spot at the center of the stye (this represents pus rising to the surface of the stye);
, Styes are identified by their appearance and symptoms alone.There is no medical test for styes.This can sometimes make it difficult to tell the difference between a stye and a chalazion. Chalazia are related to styes, but they are caused when a meibomian gland -- an oil-producing gland in your eyelid -- experiences a blockage and becomes inflamed.Though they may appear superficially similar, chalazia have several qualities that differentiate them from styes. These include the following:Unlike styes, chalazia often don't hurt.
Chalazia usually occur on the inside of the eyelid, rather than along its edge.
Chalazia progress more slowly than styes. They will usually form more gradually and can last for several months before disappearing
Chalazia can grow larger than styes. If they grow large enough, they can even inhibit vision.
Though most chalazia eventually go away, persistent chalazia may require surgery to remove.

, The vast majority of styes will disappear within a day or two and don't require you to visit a doctor. However, in severe cases, styes can be particularly painful and debilitating. They may even progress into a more serious infection. See your doctor if your stye:Shows no signs of improving within 48 hours
Causes your vision to change or worsen
Has an excessive amount of discharge and/or a discharge that seems to change over time
Causes intense pain that keeps you from performing your everyday activities

"
"
Ease your discomfort.,
Protect the eye from further irritation.,
Try an over-the counter treatment.,
Avoid straining your eyes.,
Allow the stye to open on its own.,
See a doctor if necessary.",How to Cure a Stye2," Styes will typically go away on their own after two or three days. Before they do, however, they can be quite painful and irritating. To make the wait more bearable, use one or more of the common methods listed below to keep your discomfort under control:


Apply a warm compress. Wet a clean washcloth with hot water and place it gently on top of your closed eye for ten minutes, repeating four times a day.Warm compresses not only ease pain and inflammation, but also speed the healing process.Press very gently - only as hard is as necessary to keep the compress against your eye.
Many traditional home remedies for treating styes use the same basic principles as a warm compress: mild heat, moisture, and light pressure. For example, one traditional remedy is wrapping a freshly hard-boiled egg in a sock, then holding it against the stye.
Over-the-counter pain medications can also be used to reduce the severity of eye pain associated with the infection. Use the recommended dosage of a mild painkiller/anti-inflammatory drug like acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen.

, One of the most important ways to keep your pain level down and speed the healing process is to make sure the stye isn't irritated, disturbed or injured in any way. Though you may have an intense desire to take action and ""do something"" about your stye, know that, with styes, what you don't do is just as important as what you do. Follow the guidelines below to protect your stye:Don't wear contact lenses if you have a stye, as they will irritate the infection. Take any contacts out and wear glasses instead.
Don't press or squeeze the stye in order to drain it. Never poke, prod, or otherwise put pressure on a stye, as this can irritate it. Bursting a stye prematurely can increase your chance of infection, leading to prolonged pain.
Don't wear eye makeup. In addition to the possibility that you may irritate the stye, you may also accidentally spread stye-causing bacteria through makeup use.
If you must touch your eye, wash your hands carefully before doing so.

, Basic pain medications aren't the only over-the-counter options for treating styes. A variety of specially-designed medications are also available for this purpose. These remedies come in a variety of forms, including topical ointments, eye drop solutions, and medicated pads. Visit your local pharmacy to see which options are available to you.Polymyxin B sulfate is an effective antibiotic in treating styes and other bacterial eye infections.Commercial lid scrubs and moisturizing solutions may help keep your eye moisturized and relieve discomfort., Any activities that strain your eyes, like excessive computer use or reading under poor lighting conditions, should be avoided when you have a stye. The additional eye strain can irritate a stye, prolonging pain and increasing the risk of infection. Take occasional breaks when reading or working at a computer. Close your eyes for a few minutes if needed.


If you don't notice any additional irritation from computer use, etc., feel free to continue working. You should still take a break if/when irritation does occur.

, Within a few days, your stye should begin to shrink and disappear. It may also open on its own and begin to drain. If your stye opens, soak up any discharge with a clean rag and clean the new wound with baby shampoo and water. You can hold clean medical gauze to your eye to help soak up any further discharge.Never deliberately lance or squeeze a stye. This can open you up to the risk of a more serious infection that requires stronger treatment.

, If your stye doesn't go away on its own after 2-7 days, or if symptoms seem to be worsening, make an appointment to see your doctor. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics and/or steroid ointments, and, in extreme cases, may need to surgically remove the stye."

Know the risk factors for styes.,
Practice proper hygiene.,
Change your sharing habits.,
Use clean eye makeup.,
Keep your eyes clean and free of debris.",How to Cure a Stye3," Though almost anyone can get a stye, certain factors can increase your susceptibility. By eliminating the conditions that can contribute to styes, you lower the risk that you will get a stye in the future. Unfortunately, not all of the risk factors for styes are easy to change or eliminate. Listed below are the factors and conditions that are known to increase a person's chances of getting a stye:


High levels of stress
High levels of fat in the bloodstream
Diabetes mellitus
Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid)
Seborrhea (an inflammatory skin disorder)
Certain other chronic debilitating diseases
Being between the ages of 30 and 50 (in this case, the increased risk is very slight)

, Styes can be avoided by washing your hands regularly with soap and water, especially before touching or rubbing your eye.Rubbing your eye with dirty hands can transfer bacteria from your hands into your eye, leading to infection. Washing your hands kills the vast majority of this bacteria.


Even with clean hands, try to avoid rubbing your eyes. Even clean hands can irritate your eyes.

, Sharing objects and products that are used in or around the eyes can contribute to the spread of styes. Don't share eye makeup, towels, sunglasses, or other personal items with other people, especially if these people have a stye or a history of styes. These objects can spread styes and other eye infections.

, The bacteria that cause styes can be spread via makeup. Discard old or contaminated eye makeup and be sure to keep your good makeup in a clean, safe place. Wash your hands before applying makeup to your eyes. As noted above, avoid sharing makeup with a friend, especially if you or your friend have a history of styes.

, The initial infection that causes a stye often occurs when one of an eyelid's meibomian glands becomes clogged. Thus, one good way to prevent styes is to decrease the likelihood that a gland will become clogged in the first place. Wear sunglasses or other protective eyewear in environments with a high level of airborne particulate matter. If you work at a construction site or in a manufacturing job, you should always protect your eyes from debris.


If you have a history of styes, then you may be naturally more susceptible to styes than the average person. In this case, you may want to take the time to wash your eyes daily with warm water, a clean rag, and/or baby shampoo.

Increase your fiber intake.,
Avoid fatty foods.,
Eat probiotics.,
Avoid sodium, starches and artificial sweeteners.,
Reduce gas.,
Remove any known or suspected allergens from your diet.",How to Aid Digestion Naturally1," Fiber is your best friend when it comes to digestion. It increases the size and softness of your stool, making it easier to pass and preventing constipation.


Fiber also regulates blood sugar levels by slowing down digestion and allowing glucose from food to enter your blood stream at a slower rate.
Increase your fiber intake by eating high fiber foods such as oatmeal and bran cereal, legumes such as lentils, black beans and pinto beans, and nuts such as peanuts, walnuts and pecans. High fiber fruits like berries, prunes, dried apricots, raisins, pears and apples (with the skins on) are also good choices.Alternatively (or additionally) you can take a daily fiber supplement to help with digestion.;
, Your digestion system finds fatty foods difficult to process, which slows the entire digestive process down. Speed things up by reducing fat in your diet.


Choose leaner meats such as chicken and turkey as a source of protein. If you're eating beef or pork, go for the leaner cuts of meat.
Switch from full fat dairy products to low-fat or non-fat versions of milk, cheese and yogurt. Swap butter and margarine for olive oil when cooking.
Avoid eating fried, processed and frozen foods which tend to be high in fat., Probiotics are a kind of good bacteria, similar to the microorganisms found naturally in the human body, which help to keep the intestines healthy and the bowels moving.


Simply by introducing more probiotic foods into your system you can prevent excess gas, diarrhea and other digestive problems.
Probiotic-rich foods include yogurt, miso soup, sauerkraut, soft cheeses, kefir, sourdough bread.
Try taking a probiotic supplement if you are finding it hard to get probiotics through your diet. These supplements are available in capsule, powder and liquid form at pharmacies and health food stores.
However, you should talk to your doctor before taking these supplements, as they can be unhealthy for people with certain preexisting health conditions., If you regularly suffer from a swollen, bloated stomach, you should cut foods containing high quantities of sodium starch and artificial sweeteners from your diet, as these may be the culprits.


You should also avoid overeating at mealtimes, as this also increases the chances of bloating.
Bloating occurs when gas particles formed by bacteria in the intestinal tract travel back into the stomach, causing it swell like a balloon.Bloating can also be a symptom of more serious underlying conditions, such as diverticulitis, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and ovarian cancer, so if you make the changes suggested above but still suffer from bloating, you should consult your doctor.

, Producing too much gas is a common problem that can cause awkwardness and embarrassment for a lot of people. Luckily, there are several things you can do to control your body's gas production.


Avoid foods which contribute to gas production. Examples of such foods include most varieties of beans as well as vegetables like cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.
Avoid carbonated drinks. Sodas and other carbonated drinks contain a lot of air, which increases the amount of gas your body produces.
Eat more slowly. When you eat too quickly, you tend to swallow more air, which contributes to gas production., Eating foods that you have an unknown allergy or sensitivity to is one of the main culprits behind digestive problems such as bloating, gas, and pain. Simply by cutting certain key items out of your diet, you can easily eliminate many digestive concerns.


Dairy products, strawberries, nuts, chicken, eggs and gluten-products are common allergens to which many people react badly, even though they may not realize it.
If you suspect you might be sensitive to something, completely remove it from your diet for several days to see if you feel a difference in your digestion. Do this with one food at a time so you can pinpoint the problem. Reintroduce the food after a few days and take notes on how your body reacts.
If you cannot pinpoint the exact food that is causing digestive problems, contact your doctor about performing a food allergy test.

Drink lots of water, at least 8 glasses per day.,
Get regular exercise.,
Go to the bathroom promptly.,
Lose a few pounds.,
Slow down when you eat.,
Try a short belly massage.,
Take a break from bad habits.,
Apply a warm water bottle on your belly after meals.,
Check the labels on all prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs.",How to Aid Digestion Naturally2," Water helps your body break down bulk and flush out toxins that can interfere with natural digestion. It also makes your stool softer and easier to pass.


Carry a water bottle around with you throughout the day. This will help you remember to drink more and give you something to do when you're bored. Drink extra water after exercising, as you lose a lot of fluid through sweat.
You will know that your body is adequately hydrated when your urine remains clear throughout the day. The more dehydrated you are, the yellower your urine will be.Choose fruits and vegetables that have high water content, such as watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges.

, Regular exercise can assist in benefit digestion.


Exercise speeds up digestion by increasing blood flow to your organs and stimulating the muscles in the intestines, helping them to process waste more quickly.Try cardio exercises such as walking, swimming and jogging, which get the entire body moving. Also, try to make small changes such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

, When you feel the first urge to move your bowels, go to the bathroom. If you delay, water will be reabsorbed in your colon, and the stool will become harder and more difficult to pass., Excess weight can put pressure on the abdominal area and cause a condition whereby the valve between the stomach and the esophagus fails to close properly, resulting in acid reflux and heartburn.Relieve the pressure caused by any extra pounds by losing some weight. You can do this safely and effectively through a combination of healthy diet and exercise.
Some other handy weight loss tips include controlling portion sizes by eating from smaller plates, drinking a glass of water before meals to fill yourself up, and eating your last meal at least four hours before bed.

, Eating on the go or taking large, hurried bites can cause you to swallow a lot of air. This air turns into gas in your body and may cause severe cramping and discomfort. Eating too fast also causes you to overeat, which puts more pressure on the digestive system, slowing down the process.


Chew each bite of food at least 20 times before your swallow - this gives your stomach time to prepare for the food it is about to receive and your brain time to register that you're full.
Avoid eating while watching TV, checking your Facebook, or reading a magazine or newspaper, as you tend to eat more when you're distracted. Eat dinner at the table, and focus on each bite you put into your mouth.v

, Press firmly and slowly with your fingers at a 3–5 centimeter (1.2–2.0 in) radius all around your belly button, in a clockwise motion. For best results, do for 2 to 5 minutes. When practiced after meals or at least once a day — in the evening before going to bed — this simple technique quickly helps your digestion.

, Try a few days with no sugary snacks, processed foods, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. This will give your digestive tract a chance to regain its natural balance.


After this break, you may want to try a natural detoxifying program for digestive health. These can be found in many health food stores and nutrition centers. Read all directions fully, and follow the program exactly to avoid compounding your digestive problems.

, This simple trick may also improve digestion by helping the muscles of the stomach and intestines to relax.

, If any of your medications list gas, bloating, nausea, or other digestive stress as side effects, it may be a good idea to take a break, or ask your doctor about switching to an alternative option.

Try to not be on a phone, TV, tablet, computer etc. an hour before bed, screens stimulate your brain, making it harder to fall asleep. 
Don't exercise right before bed.  You might think it will make you tired, but your heart is beating and you are in ""get-up and go mode"" instead of ""fall asleep mode"".  Exercise in the morning instead. 
Make sure you go to the bathroom before bed, because if you don't, you might wake up to go to the bathroom, or worse, wet your bed and have to clean it up.

Be aware that the most important thing in your future will be your education.,
Be healthy.,
Be nice to everyone.,
Find a hobby.,
Be Yourself.,
Have a good group of friends that you like.,
If you want a boyfriend/girlfriend, get one.",How to Make the Best of Your Teenage Years," It's very crucial to try your best to make good grades, and push yourself to as far as you think you can go. If you feel overloaded, don't give yourself more than you can handle. Some parents put pressure on their kids to do well, and if you feel this is happening to you, try talking with your parents or a guidance counselor. Maybe they have different expectations of you, and you need to make it clear if you want a different future than they have planned for you. I recommend keeping a planner and writing due dates, tests, and your daily homework in it. It can really help you keep track of everything and will keep you very organized. Get a tutor if you need one, and choose classes that are appealing to you, not just what your friends want. With good grades and a positive attitude, you could get into a college, which will help a LOT with your future. Many kids drop out of high school-- DON'T. You'll regret it a lot later. If you have dreams, do everything you can do accomplish them. You'll be proud of yourself. If you are in college, start out with a lighter work load and build up. Try to go into a major that you enjoy and it might lead you into some type of job. If you are still undecided, try to take classes you like in your A.A or B.A degree, but still try to have a path. Same as high school. College students will be having a lot more homework than high school, but if you treat it like a high school schedule, it is really not that intimidating. Avoid putting too much pressure on yourself all at once. Try to separate issues of friends and family from studies, it's difficult but if you can learn to do it early it will become easier later.;
, It's important to keep yourself clean and healthy. Shower daily. Don't put too many chemicals on your body. Brush your teeth twice a day. Floss. Wash your face. Lots of kids get pimples in their teen years, most can be solved by washing your face often or dabbing some pimple cream on it. Vitamins may help with acne too and other things as well. You can hide them with cover-up. If you have out of control acne, see a dermatologist. Make the right choices when eating. If you get enough exercise doing the activities you enjoy, and eat only when you're hungry and stop when you're full, you will be at the ideal weight for YOU. Eating disorders and obesity are common issues for teens. Don't eat when you are bored, eat when you are actually having a growling stomach. See a doctor if you are uncomfortable about your weight. They can help you develop a healthy and SAFE alternative. Wear clean clothes that you like and that are comfortable. Wear deodorant if you sweat, and if you wear makeup, be sure to wash it off before you go to sleep. Keep things natural, that's the key to makeup.

, Be friendly and polite. A good way to meet new friends is to compliment someone, which usually results in a smile. Try to start a conversation and see if you have anything in common. It's really not as scary as it sounds! Most people want to make new friends, too, they're just too shy to strike up a conversation. Make the first move!

, Everyone is passionate about something. Books, fashion, sports, music, etc. If you don't know what you love, try lots of different things until you find something that clicks. Then, learn as much as you can about it and practice it a lot! Before you know it, you will be an expert at whatever you love. It always gives you something to do, and people like people who have interests.

, Many teens feel peer pressure to be like everyone else. Sometimes it's as simple as saying the cool slang words or shopping at the same stores or listening to the same music as the ""popular kids"". Define yourself as an individual. Everyone is made different, even the most identical twins. If you choose to listen to the mainstream pop out there and watch the cool shows, go ahead. But if you choose to be more alternative and non-conformist, go ahead too. Many new trendsetters were people that didn't conform. Think of Elvis. He was wearing pink and black with rhinestones; that was considered dorky, but in a few years, the cool kids were wearing it. People will appreciate you much more. Some peer pressure is much more extreme. It depends on what you are comfortable with and believe in before you have sex. It's a very serious decision, and has very serious consequences. The only sure way not to get pregnant or get an STD is abstinence. Even condoms, etc. are not 100% safe. If you do have sex, use protection, and be smart. Get to know the person before you do anything. Be careful about parties. Keep an eye on your drink.. Talk with a counselor, even if you're not going through anything difficult at the time. When you ARE (and you will) you'll be glad you have someone to talk to.

, Don't try to be popular, it's not really as great as you imagine. Don't make friends with people who engage in illegal activities. Make plans with your friends often, keep yourself busy.

, They're fun to have, but not everybody wants one or is ready for one. Wait until you're ready.

Consider why you find it hard to let your feelings show.,
Think about the ways you'd like to show your feelings.,
Choose to reveal some feelings, rather than trying to become a touchy-feely personality.,
Choose the right people to show your feelings to.,
Deal with underlying issues that might be preventing you from showing your feelings.,
Be gentle with yourself.,
Remind yourself that you are a strong person inside.,
Do not seek to have your feelings validated by others.,
Make it a habit to not hide your feelings from someone who shows you theirs.",How to Let Your Feelings Show," If you've become used to guarding your emotions, feelings and expressions, then it may be hard to see showing feelings as normal behavior. If you've been hurt in the past and decided that hiding feelings was safer, then you at least have a reason behind your choice that you can further investigate. On the other hand, if hiding your feelings or not even having the desire to reveal them has always driven you, it may be more difficult to work out why you don't let them show. It is important to be certain as to why you want to let them show, otherwise you may end up doing something that only leaves you feeling uncomfortable and exposed.;
, You can talk about feelings and express them verbally. You can cry, smile, laugh, shake your fists, growl, yell, make faces, flush red, do cartwheels, etc. Choose the ways that you consider best express your feelings at the time they arise. There is no right or wrong way but do be aware that you'll need to use language, either written or spoken, to be absolutely clear when conveying your feelings to another person. While body language and sounds can convey a lot of meaning, clarity is helped through language and the use of clear, straightforward words.


Realize that even without trying, your body will often show how you truly feel. It can be helpful to learn to read those signs in others, and in yourself.

, There are gradations of showing feelings. It's not recommended that you turn from the strong and silent type into a drama king or queen. That's not who you are and it won't benefit you to become gushy and to let out raw emotion constantly. Instead, aim to slowly unfold some of your feelings that are positive and likely to encourage positive responses from others.


For example, you could choose to show more happiness and appreciation for what others do for you than you have in the past. You could also choose to not express feelings that you consider will expose you to people's criticism or unwanted reactions, such as anger, annoyance or fear.

, Begin with people you trust completely and upon whom you can rely. These trustworthy people are likely to be family and close friends and they will be understanding of your desire to reveal more of yourself.


Choose people who love you unconditionally and will not judge you.

, For example, if you're shy, have social anxiety or other conditions that might hamper your ability to show feelings, it may be helpful to seek counseling or to talk through your concerns with a person you trust and who offers good advice.

, When you want to express your feelings but you feel tongue-tied because of the situation or person before you, let it be. Sometimes words cannot express all that needs to be understood. Other times, you may feel so anxious or scared, that it's hard to show feelings for fear of breaking down or cracking up.


For example, if you love someone who seems to hardly know you exist, it can be difficult to express your feelings because you're frightened that they might reject you.

, Your feelings are a part of who you are and are valid. People cannot tell you how to feel and should anyone dismiss your feelings, they are being thoughtless, unkind and, in some cases, manipulative. Your feelings are yours alone, and are not to be controlled or dismissed by others.


Try to stay calm if someone insists that you cannot feel the way that you do. They are mistaken, not you.

, Just as people cannot dismiss your feelings from their perspective, nor can you expect to have others tell you that it's okay to feel as you do. Feelings are personal to who you are and your reaction to events, comments, actions and attitudes is part of you. If you want someone else to validate your feelings of sadness, happiness or anything else, then you allow them to control you. Instead, if you are overwhelmed by your feelings, learn mindfulness or self-calming techniques in order to control over-reactions or being tied down to certain feelings.


If you want someone else to validate your feelings, you risk constant rejection. It's okay for others to see your feelings and not like them. It's not okay to ask others to like them so that you can feel better.

, It's a fair exchange and likely to be a lot more enjoyable and connecting for both of you. It is an important part of appreciating each other's existence.

It might take a lot of time and hard work before you feel like a true woman, but there are steps you can take to make the transition., The world is constantly changing, and there are a lot of things to learn. Consider purchasing or checking out of the library books that can help orient you to the world of womanhood. Pay attention to the memoirs and autobiographies of women you respect.You will be exposed to the challenges they faced, which will help you confront your own challenges.

, If you act like an adult, not only will you be treated like an adult but you will also have higher self-esteem.Some key steps you can take include:


Avoiding procrastination. Take responsibility for your commitments, and complete your tasks in a timely way.
Having good manners. Behaving in a kind and polite way can help set the stage for a responsible adulthood.Standing up for yourself. Politeness is important, but it does not mean that you should be walked all over. Learn how to express your views with confidence, even if the people around you are not behaving as politely as you are.

, While women tend to underestimate their abilities, men tend to overestimate their abilities.This is known as the ""confidence gap."" Keep this in mind as you enter adulthood: even if you feel nervous about a task, you might very well be the most competent person in the room. Some ways you can overcome the confidence gap include:


Seeking out female role models. Find women in leadership positions who can help you learn leadership skills of your own, such as how to speak with confidence, how to supervise a team, and how to engage in constructive criticism.Not letting your ""niceness"" keep you down. Kindness and politeness are important skills for adulthood, but women are often told to be nice and polite at the expense of their knowledge and expertise. Try to find a good balance between acting kindly and sticking to your guns.Speaking confidently. Practice speaking to others with power and confidence. Stand up straight, project your voice, keep eye contact with your listeners, and speak in definitive tones. Resist the urge to make your definitive statements sound like you are asking questions or asking for permission (""uptalk"").Passing it on. Just as young women depend on other women for leadership skills, you have the potential to be a key role model for younger generations too. Pass along your unique knowledge and skill sets to a younger woman who could benefit from it, and continue to hone your leadership skills., Being up-to-date about important current events and news items is a great way for you to appear knowledgeable and responsible. You will have lots of material for adult conversations and will also begin to learn about your place in a much larger world. This can also help you decide what your values are as you enter the world of adulthood. Consider:


Reading, watching, or listening to the news regularly.
Find journalists you respect and follow their stories.
Read well-researched nonfiction books about topics you care about.
Make your own conclusions. While you will have to get your information from other sources at first, eventually you will be able to analyze events on your own. If you are old enough to vote, you can vote for the candidates and policies that align most closely with your own. If not, you can find other ways to get involved, such as by writing, signing petitions, or volunteering with organizations you care about.

, Most cultures have some kind of important ceremonial marker to designate when a boy becomes a man or when a girl becomes a woman. These rituals can help make a young person feel like an adult and a full-fledged member of a community. Whether it is a Sweet 16 party, a Quinceanera, or a Ji Li, these rituals serve as a significant turning point in the life of a young woman.Depending on what culture you identify with, you might want to plan a coming-of-age ritual or party to mark the beginning of your life as a woman and to bid farewell to your girlhood.

, It is important to set independent goals for what you want your life path to look like. These goals might be different from your parents' goals and they might be influenced by your friends and peers instead.You might even set goals that are completely different from those in your family or peer group. Perhaps the most important marker of a mature woman is that she lives according to her decisions and values. Think carefully about what you want out of life, and make a plan to live up to those goals.

, Being a woman also involves maturing emotionally, psychologically, and behaviorally. Most importantly: you will have to learn how to be independent. This will involve learning new skills and habits that will pave a pathway toward success as an adult., There are a lot of things to learn. You might not be able to learn them all right away, but these life skills will allow you to carve your own path through the world without relying on anybody else. Consider purchasing or checking out of the library books that can help orient you to the world of womanhood. Pay attention to how-to guides to help you learn valuable skills.The internet, your friends, and trusted adult mentors are also great resources for learning the skills you will need to be an independent woman.

, Financial responsibility is important as you mature from a girl into a woman.Perhaps you are working in your first job, preparing to pay for college, or thinking about moving out of your parents' home. In all these cases you will have to learn important life skills such as:


Balancing your checkbook.
Keeping careful track of your income and expenses.
Paying your taxes in a timely way.
Saving up for large purchases and to create a safety net.
Learning when it makes sense to take on debt, and when it does not make sense.

, One way to become a more independent young woman is to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B without depending on your parents. Depending on how old you are and where you live, you might inquire about getting your driver's license or learning permit.Otherwise you can look into public transportation options so that you can travel freely to school, work, and other locations.

, Being able to keep your commitments, show up on time, take responsibility for your actions, and respond appropriately to criticism will all serve you well in your life as a woman, especially if you work in a career.Finding and keeping a job will allow you to learn how to be independent and will also give you some financial freedom as you mature into womanhood.

, As your body develops, your body will have different requirements for appearing put-together and healthy.For example, you might have to shower more often than you did when you were a girl, and you might want to use different products to clean your face now that it is more acne-prone. Other things to keep in mind are:


Keeping your hair tidy. Whether your hair is long or short, straight or curly, you will want to find ways to keep your hair from appearing messy. Perhaps you will put your hair up into a bun, find a short cut that you can maintain easily, or trim your split ends frequently.
Taking care of your clothing. Make sure that your clothing fits and that you are taking care that your clothes are clean, wrinkle-free, and in good shape.
Wearing accessories. Some women like to wear jewelry and make-up; others do not. If you choose to wear accessories, make sure they are age-appropriate, adhere to dress codes for work or school, and that you are not allergic to them. For example, a bright pink unicorn necklace might have been appropriate when you were a girl in school, but will likely be frowned upon at your new job at a local bank. Consider a simple gold necklace instead.

, Whether you live with your parents, siblings, roommates, or by yourself, you will need to take more responsibility for the place where you live.As a child, perhaps you could let things slide, but adulthood brings with it more responsibility. This means cleaning up any messes you make, vacuuming and sweeping regularly, and making sure common areas (such as bathrooms or kitchens) are cleaned regularly.

, Figuring out how to prepare healthy snacks and meals for yourself will help you mature into a healthy, happy woman.You might not be able to rely on anybody else to do your shopping, so you will have to learn how to meal plan, make a grocery list, purchase healthy and nutritious ingredients, and prepare them appropriately.


Prepare to make a lot of mistakes as you learn how to cook, but remember that these mistakes are all educational.

, Puberty is the phase of biological development when a child's body transforms into an adult body.Puberty will lead to a number of physical and emotional changes in a girl as she develops into a woman. In girls, puberty usually begins between the ages of 8 and 13 and can last for as long as 6 years.It is important that you understand what kinds of changes to expect, so that you are not shocked or scared by how your body is transforming.Typical changes during puberty include:


Growing taller and going through growth spurts.
Developing hips and breasts. Hip and breast soreness and tenderness are typical during this period.
Growing underarm and pubic hair.
Sweating more profusely.
Developing acne and other skin changes.
Beginning to menstruate.
Experiencing mood changes and mood swings.Note that if you have not started menstruating by the time you are 14 years old, you should talk to your doctor to make sure everything is developing properly., Every woman goes through puberty differently, and many women have different preferences about how they would like to handle these changes. Still, there are steps you can take to make the maturation process smoother and less stressful. One important step is talking to a trusted adult woman--who could be a family member or not--about how to react to your changing body and shifting emotions. She can serve as an important mentor during this time in your life.Not only can you benefit from hearing stories about her own maturation process, but she might be able to help guide you as you prepare for the development of your adult body.

, The years when you mature into a woman can be exciting, but also daunting. Many girls become stressed out because of weight gain, skin changes, new curves, and sudden growth spurts. Between 50% and 88% of young women report negative feelings about their bodies during this vulnerable period of time.Try to engage in body-positive activities so that you are not trapped in negative thoughts. For example:


Tell yourself that media portrayals are not accurate. It can be easy to compare yourself negatively to the models and actors you see in the media. Remember that models and celebrities are not the norm. Keep in mind that special effects, make-up teams, professional lighting techniques, and airbrushing are all used to change the appearance of celebrities.If necessary, avoid unrealistic media portrayals of girls and women: turn off the television, close the fashion magazine, and spend some time with your friends instead.
Compliment yourself. Even if puberty is bringing unwanted changes (such as acne), perhaps there are things that you like about your new body. Do you like being taller? Feeling more adult? Having curves? Look at yourself in the mirror, and give yourself compliments.You should feel proud of how you've grown.
Compliment your friends. Remember that your friends are probably experiencing negative or uncertain thoughts about their bodies, just like you. Tell your friends all the things you appreciate about them, and help boost their self-esteem.Maintain healthy eating and exercise habits. Many young women are tempted to go on extreme crash diets or exercise too often in response to their changing bodies. However, gaining body weight, increasing body fat, and growing rounder are normal, healthy changes to a developing body. Resist the temptation to go into extremes and instead follow common-sense rules about diet and exercise. Always eat nutritious food when you are hungry, and never starve yourself.Talk to your doctor about concerns about your body. If you feel like something is not right with your body, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will be able to help you decide whether the change is normal and healthy.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (or CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for those who develop a negative body image. If you experience persistent negative thoughts about your body image, talk to a doctor or counselor. You don't have to live with these thoughts, and you can feel happier and more confident with proper treatment.

, Some of the physical changes caused by puberty will require that you purchase new clothing or supplies in order to stay comfortable in your body. You might have to go on several different shopping sprees as you go through different stages of puberty. It might also take you a while before you discover what products you like the best. Having a friend or mentor help you shop will make the process easier. Everyone has different preferences, but in general you can expect to shop for the following items:When you notice yourself sweating more, you can begin to shop for deodorants (which mask body odor) and antiperspirants (which reduce the amount of underarm sweating).
When you notice that your breasts are growing and becoming sore, you can shop for training bras and bras. These items will provide you with support and coverage.
When you notice your body hair growing or darkening, you might want to purchase razors or waxing kits. Not everyone wants to get rid of her body hair, however: decide what is right for you!
When you begin to menstruate, you can begin to purchase tampons or maxi pads in order to protect your clothing from stains.
If you experience unwanted acne, you can purchase over-the-counter medication and face washes to help. You can also talk to your doctor about prescription medications that might be stronger.
When you find yourself growing taller and curvier, you can shop for new clothing, either in the Juniors' or the Women's section of clothing stores. Because you are growing quickly, you might grow out of your old clothing at a rate faster than what you are used to. You can consider shopping at a thrift store in order to keep your costs down as you explore what it means to dress a woman's body and find your own unique style.

, During and after puberty, a girl has the potential to become pregnant.This can be a huge and daunting responsibility. You will also need to take care of your sexual health. Teenage girls should begin seeing a gynecologist, who can provide advice about birth control, knowledge about the prevention of sexually transmitted illnesses, cancer screenings, and other ways to keep a woman's body healthy., The average woman claims to reach emotional maturity at the age of 32. (For men, the age is 43.)You have lots of time to grow and change: you do not become a woman overnight. It is a long and gradual process.Brains aren't even fully developed until the age of 25.Try to enjoy this journey to womanhood, even if it takes a long time.

Depending on the weather, change what you may not have worn in Winter or when it was colder.,

Enhance your best features with make up.,
Be inspired by nature.,

Listen to your favorite bands or search up a new musician.,
Watch some Horror/Comedy/Drama films in the evening and get some popcorn/drinks.,
Choose a good book, settle down and enjoy!,
Appreciate art.",How to Make Changes in Your Style and Hobbies for Spring," You probably won't need to wear your coat as often, or, if it's especially pleasant outside, not at all. Instead, swap it for a simple but beautiful mac jacket instead in a fresh, subtle colour ( like petrol blue, light grey or light emerald green) for when some days are cooler. Chiffon or cotton scarves casually thrown loosely around your neck look pretty too.;
, To start with, try wearing different combinations of clothing, such as dark blue jeans with floaty shirts or t-shirts and a floral skirt with a plain vest top and sneakers, as opposed to pumps. Next, go for mixing up how you wear things. Denim shorts look cool with plain tights or tights with stars/spots dotted all over them and a cool t-shirt. You could wear a stripy hoodie or coloured cardigan with nearly anything. You could buy a few items that you really loved and enjoy those as well!

, If you're into them, Converse would be perfect for spring. Find your pair, maybe clean them up a little bit and start to wear them more. Swap around the laces if they feel old. If you would like a pair, find a good shoe shop and choose yours that are your favorite colour or high top/ low top, whichever you would prefer. Not your thing? Vans or just some similar from New Look will put a ""spring"" in your step.

, Don't feel like you have to wear lots of sparkly or shimmery stuff either, because this can often look too much or a bit cheap. A bunch of friendship bracelets with coloured string or beads/shells are interesting to look at. A delicate chain necklace with a kooky charm adds personality. Rings with sweet motifs like flowers or butterflies are understated but definitely stand out. A fluffy corsage would look amazing in hair that is down, or if up, a bow headband.

, It can make a big impact to how you look and feel. A new hairstyle is can boost your confidence. If you like your hair how it is, just get the ends trimmed at least every 2 months. Want to change your hair but like the length and colour? Alter your fringe or get some relaxed yet choppy layers cut. However, hair can only look nice if its in good condition and healthy- wash every 2/3 days, if your hairs dry, use a hydrating intensive mask once a week, if it can get oily quickly, reduce the amount of product you put on. Heat could make hair brittle, so if you want to cut down but your hair takes ages to dry, keep it up in an hour or so then quickly finish with a few quick blasts of the hairdryer. A small amount of mousse patted onto wet hair before drying can provide UV protection and smooth strands, some hairspray can keep a style in place and a blob of shimmery cream can enhance the hairs natural shade.

, Most often, it is advised you use the whole base for your face- primer, foundation, concealer and powder. This can look heavy, so instead swap for a tinted moisturizer and loose powder. Some pink blush swept onto the apples of cheeks looks cute and healthy. Light,metallic colours on the eyelids are great for the day- especially lilac, baby pink/blue, bronze or khaki green. Black mascara is fine too and a dab of rich lip balm/ light lip gloss to finish.

, In spring, you can expect flowers and green leaves to emerge, birds to sing and the countryside to be one of the best places. Go for a long walk or bike ride at the weekend, or if you live near a woods, walk the dog there. Hang out in the garden if the suns shining, run about or casually bounce crazily on the trampoline.

, Most of the time, it can be a little negative, so steer clear of people being spiteful and ignore any arguments. Its meant to be for connecting with people, so enjoy checking out photo albums and chatting to your friends. No one gets hurt, there's no bad feelings and you can keep in contact with people.

, Find that song you hear once before but liked, learn some lyrics, just be in the music. You could go onto YouTube or play a CD in your bedroom. Rock/ Indie/ Soul are amazing genres.

, This is a really chilled out thing to do. If you have a box set of your favorite show, then watch a few of those.

, Reading isn't nerdy, despite what some may say. In fact, it's original and can always be enjoyed- unlike texting or doing nothing. Borrow a few from the Library, start reading through a series or find a Christmas/Birthday gift. Reading lets you spend time to identify with characters, be involved in situations and most importantly, enter another place! Using books is not only helpful but a really precious way to spend some of your spare time.

, Art is creative and thoughtful. Painting is classic and some people love to create a picture from acrylics or watercolours. Others prefer drawing things they see around them, or from objects of theirs. Both are very expressive, but if you prefer using card, ribbons or pictures in art, how about making collages? Or a sketchbook/scrapbook with your photos and craft embellishments stuck in to decorate?

Recognize that you generally have a right to free speech.,
Understand that most schools can tell you what to wear.,
Know that your school cannot discriminate against your religious beliefs.,
Realize that you have limited rights to search and seizure.",How to Know What Your Rights Are As a Teen1," As a student, you enjoy the same First Amendment rights as everyone else in the United States. That means that you can speak, print, draw, sing and generally express your opinions in a school setting. However, this does not mean that you can say anything. You cannot threaten someone or defame them - say things that are untrue. You also do not have a right to express obscenities. School officials can also censor your right to expression if they can demonstrate a reasonable educational justification for doing so.First Amendment guarantees only apply to public schools. Private schools do not fall under this jurisdiction, unless state law or school policy state otherwise.
Depending on what state you live in, your right to free expression in school may be different. Check with your local ACLU about your First Amendment rights.
Some states, such as Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Oregon and Massachusetts, have granted students strengthened students’ rights against censorship.;
, Although the First Amendment would appear to protect your right to wear whatever you wanted, most schools have the legal right to enforce dress codes. Dress codes can vary from school to school and state to state. However, your school must make its dress code public and available for everyone to read.This also applies to your hair and makeup.
Be sure to check your school’s dress code to make sure that you meet the standards. If you wear clothing the school considers inappropriate, you may be sent home.
These rules do not apply to private schools unless stated otherwise by a state legislature or school charter.

, Under the First Amendment, you also have a right to express your religious beliefs, or lack thereof. The First Amendment also prohibits public schools from endorsing, promoting or requiring participation in a specific religion or religious activity. In fact, religious activities can only occur at public schools if they are led by students. As a student, you can express your beliefs without a fear of punishment.Private schools have the right to promote a certain religious viewpoint unless stated otherwise by a state legislature or school charter.

, If a teacher or other school official has “reasonable suspicion” that you are violating the law or a school code, they can search you and your belongings. Unfortunately, there is no good definition of what constitutes “reasonable suspicion” and most cases are left to the discretion of school officials. It is more difficult for police officers, who need “probable cause” and a search warrant to perform a search.Without any proof that you’ve done something wrong, you do not have to consent to a search by the police or school officials. However, if you agree to be searched, any subsequent searches are considered legal.
You cannot be strip searched by school officials.

Recognize that your parents will likely have access to your health care information.,
Realize that you can get Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) services without your parent’s consent.,
Know that you will likely need parental consent to get an abortion.,
Understand that you may have a right to contraceptives.,
Consider Emancipation.",How to Know What Your Rights Are As a Teen2," Under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, there are certain privacy protections placed on a patient’s health records in the United States. Many of these protections do not apply to minors. However, your provider can choose not to relinquish your records to your parent if they feel that there is a danger of domestic abuse, violence or neglect against you.Be sure to let your provider know if you releasing your records to your parent may endanger you.

, If you contract an STI, you have a right to be tested and treated without getting your parent’s consent. However, in 18 states, a doctor can contact a minor’s parents if they believe that it is in the minor’s best interests. If you contract HIV/AIDS, you can be tested confidentially. However, if you are under 18, your doctor will have to get your parent’s permission to treat you, unless the doctor thinks your parents would deny your treatment.If you believe that you have HIV/AIDS, be sure to check your state’s rules and regulations about receiving treatment.
A detailed list of each state’s health and reproductive laws can be found at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-minors-consent-law


, In the United States, only two states and the District of Columbia allow minors to get abortions without their parent’s consent. In many states, you will need to notify your parents and/or get their consent in order to receive an abortion. If your parents do not consent, you can go before a judge who will determine if you are mature enough for an abortion.If you are considering an abortion, visit with an educator at your local Planned Parenthood.
In some instances, your parents may be notified if there is a complication with the abortion.

, If you are interested in getting contraceptives, more than half of all states allow you to obtain it without your parent’s consent. Other states allow minors over a certain age or in special circumstances to get contraception without parental consent. Be sure to research your state’s laws before getting contraception., If live somewhere that requires parental consent and you need to reproductive or medical assistance, you may want to consider gaining emancipation from your parents. Successfully receiving emancipation grants you autonomy under the law, meaning that you no longer need parent consent. In order to obtain emancipation, you will need to go before a judge and prove that you are capable of supporting yourself and that your parents are not assisting you.


In most states you can become emancipated at the age of 16. However, be sure to check local laws and regulations.

Realize that you have a right to safely express your identity.,
Know that you may have a right to express your gender identity through the appropriate clothing.,
Understand that you have the right to your romantic relationships like other students.,
Recognize that the law is on your side when it comes to bullying.,
Know that you have the right to use the bathroom of your choice.",How to Know What Your Rights Are As a Teen3," If you are an LGBTQA teen that attends a public school in the United States, you enjoy the same First Amendment rights as every other student. This means that you can be open and expressive of your sexuality and gender identity. For example, as a transgender student, you have the right to use and request that others use your preferred personal pronouns.This also means that you have the right to form LGBTQA groups and celebrate LGBTQA events.

, Although schools can largely dictate their own dress codes, if you are a transgender student, you may have greater freedom to dress in a way that matches your gender identity. Because of increasing legal pressure, many schools in the United States are rewriting their dress codes to accommodate transgender students., As a gay or lesbian student, your school cannot prohibit your from bringing a same-sex partner to any school dances or events. While at the dance, the school must ensure your safety like it does all of the other students. Also, school officials cannot limit your public displays of affection more than they limit a straight student’s., As a LGBTQA youth, you will likely experience some form of bullying. However, most states have anti-bullying legislation on the books that protect LGBTQA students. If you are being bullied by another student or school official, it is your right to take legal action against them.Schools can be considered liable if they do not adequately protect LGBTQA students.

, You have a right to use the restroom that reflects your gender identity. However, if you are transgender, many schools in the United States may still prevent you from using facilities that align with your gender identity. You may want to talk with school administrators or a guidance counselor before entering a bathroom that does not align with your birth gender."
"
First, stop and sit down and think and make a list of all the stressful things in your life.,
How do you know if you're under stress, not just by how you feel?,
If you feel like you need a break in life try doing this: Treat yourself to something warm and tasty (be sure it's something healthy though, unhealthy foods just add to stress!),
Try just taking deep breaths every once in a while.,
When you are alone, talk out loud about what you have to get done.,
Try keeping peace with people at home and at work, school, etc.,
Keep a healthy diet!,
Keep hydrated!,
Keep negative thoughts out please!,
Exercise helps a lot.,
Try keeping a regular schedule each day.,
Have a clean healthy life style.",How to Lead a Stress Free Life," Now think of all the good things in your life that will happen and have happened. Now look at all the stressful things and come up with a good, and positive solution for each one. Try doing this once a week, or if you feel like you're under a lot of stress. You're now stress free!;
, Well the most common signs are, constantly gritting your teeth, nausea, having trouble breathing, panic attacks, pain of any kind, eczema, depression, sleep problems, obesity, and digestive problems.

, like chicken noodle soup. Proceed with a warm tea and hot bath. Take the bath with bath beads, or just simple bubble bath will be fine. After wards, dress in warm pajamas, and watch your favorite movie and even have a small piece of chocolate to to top it off.

, Breath in through your nose and count to three and breath out through your mouth counting down from three. Do this three times and you'll feel much better!

, Then say when and how you are going to finish that stuff. When you hear yourself figure out a plan, it will create more confidence that you can get it all done. Technically, you don't have to be alone when you do this, but you may seem a little crazy if you are talking to yourself in your school hallways!

, Try being happy and positive and understanding of those around you.

, Eating unhealthy foods puts unwanted oils in your body which causes acne, and makes you feel...bleh. Try having five fruits and vegetables each day. This means having five fruits would be acceptable (so would having three fruits and two vegetables.) Also having at least two servings of meat and poultry each day is healthy. Avoid eating a lot of foods that contain alcohol, caffeine, wheat, dairy, and sugar. (Soda, coffee, alcoholic beverages, pasta, bread, etc.)

, Drinking at least eight full glasses of water a day helps a lot! It washes out unwanted toxins in the body which contribute to stress and acne. Drink the water as the day goes by, not all at once.

, If you lack confidence it makes it worse, so always have a handful of confident thoughts with you ready and armed!

, Even going for a small jog each day helps! Going to the gym is good too, but getting fresh air and sunshine helps a little more.Try swimming, running, riding a bike, and other outdoor sports.

, Try getting up at a stable time and the same for going to bed. Don't eat lunch or dinner too late or early.

, Keep your room clean and make your bed each morning when you wake up. Clean your sheets every four weeks and shower every day. Wash your face as soon as you wake up in the morning. Don't leave clothes on your floor and try to keep your floors clear. Keep your drawers organized. Even try practicing, feng shui. I've tried it and it's made a great significant difference in my stress.

Recognize the signs of depression.,
Figure out if your teen is involved with bullying.,
Realize the connection to physical or sexual abuse.,
Note any past suicide attempts.,
Look for a family history or exposure to suicidal behavior.,
Decide if your teen has a substance abuse issue.,
Think about any recent changes your teen has experienced.",How to Know if a Teenager Is a Risk for Suicide1," Risk of suicide is higher in teens who are struggling with depression. This is a serious condition that should be addressed as soon as possible. Symptoms of depression may include feeling sad or hopeless, crying a lot, having changes in sleeping or eating habits, having trouble concentrating, complaining of aches and pains, and losing interest in previously enjoyable activities.This generally has to last for two weeks or more to be considered depression.

If you suspect your teen is depressed, gently share your concerns with them and let them know you are there for support. You might say, “I’ve noticed that you have been sleeping a lot and not eating. Jacob heard you crying late into the night. I’m worried and I think we should get you to a doctor.”;
, Researchers have identified a link between bullying and suicidal behavior. However, this is not to say that bullying causes suicidal behavior. Teens who are bullied cope with a lot of pressure both at home and at school. Unfortunately, they may see suicide as the only way out.On the other hand, suicidal behavior isn’t only common in victims of bullying. Studies show that students who report being involved in bullying have higher rates of suicide. This means that the victim, the bully, or any witnesses are at risk.
Parents should start and open dialogue with their children about bullying so that they feel more comfortable discussing this behavior. Get involved with your teen’s friends and the school in order to stay in the loop about possible bullying behavior.

, Exposure to abusive behavior or being the victim of this behavior increases a teen’s odds of feeling suicidal. If you have knowledge that your teen has been physically or sexually abused, pay close attention to their behavior to prevent suicide.Keep in mind that by this age, you can usually have an open conversation with your teen about these things. If you know that your teen has been abused, or notice they are acting differently, then try asking them about it. Also, let them know that they can always come to you to talk if they ever start to struggle.

, If your teen has attempted to commit suicide in the past, then they are more likely to try again in the future. Consider your teen’s history and any attempts they have made to help you determine their risk., Teens who have a parent with a history of depression or a relative who has attempted or completed suicide are also at risk. Similarly, if your teen witnessed the suicide of a family member, or has a friend or peer who recently attempted or died by suicide, this also increases their chances of having suicidal thoughts.Talk to your child about their exposure to suicidal behavior. You might say, “Everyone in the community is really shaken by the Jefferson boy’s suicide. How are you dealing with all of this?” You can also ask, “If you ever started having thoughts like that, what would you do? Would you feel comfortable coming and talking to me?”

, Another risk factor for teen suicide is drug or alcohol abuse. Use of drugs and alcohol is also a form of self-medication for teens who are coping with anxiety or depression as it helps numb uncomfortable feelings. However, these substances often intensify the negative feeling and make teens feel worse. If you suspect your teen may be abusing drugs or alcohol, get them to an experienced addiction counselor.

Signs of substance abuse may include making new friends and neglecting existing social ties, declining academic performance, being very secretive, neglecting personal hygiene, and withdrawing from family., Coming “out of the closet”, moving to a new place, going through a breakup, dealing with parents’ divorce, becoming pregnant or losing a close friend or family member are all significant life changes that may provoke suicidal behavior in teens. Any of these changes may bring on unpleasant feelings that a teen doesn’t know how to handle.

If your teen has recently experienced a significant life change, watch them closely. Let them know that you are there for support or recommend that they talk to a school counselor, teacher, coach or other trusted adult. Social support serves as a protective factor against teen suicide."

Watch for risk-taking behavior.,
Listen for a preoccupation with death.,
Find out if your teen has been giving away belongings.,
Look for social withdrawal.,
Pay attention to declines in appearance, activities, and academics.",How to Know if a Teenager Is a Risk for Suicide2," Teens who are considering suicide may demonstrate acting-out behaviors that are drastically out of character. They may also have an attitude of ambivalence or apathy. These behaviors may be self-destructive in nature like engaging in unprotected sex or drinking and driving. If you notice any reckless behavior in your teen that seems more pronounced than normal, take notice., Many teens who are thinking about suicide give warning signs such as a strange preoccupation with death. Your teen may write poems or songs about death or loss. They might be obsessed with films or TV shows that have undertones about death.

They might also be preoccupied with what happens after death, such as the afterlife.

, If your teen makes inferences about going away or seems to be saying “goodbye” to loved ones, they may have a plan to commit suicide. Other signs might include them giving their prized possessions away to siblings or friends, or simply throwing them away. They may even ask to visit all their relatives.This sort of behavior is common in teens who have a clear plan to harm themselves. Therefore, you should get your teen professional help right away to keep your teen safe. Also, avoid leaving your teen alone if you notice this behavior.
Other similar forms of the behavior might include refusing to make plans for the near or distant future, or refusing to commit to things.

, A teen who has made the decision to take their own life may totally drop out of the social scene. They no longer have an interest in hanging out with friends and try to skip family gatherings. If you notice a generally outgoing teen who starts to pull away from friends and family, this could be a warning sign., Another warning sign associated with teen suicidal behavior is an overall neglect of their lives. Teens who were once incredibly interested in their appearance no longer seem to care if their hair is unkempt and too long. Their grades drop significantly at school. They dodge extracurricular practice and make up excuses as to why they aren’t participating."
"
Take threats of suicide seriously.,
Remove any weapons or prescription pills.,
See a mental health counselor.,
Create a safety plan.,
Offer support.,
Encourage positive changes.",How to Know if a Teenager Is a Risk for Suicide3," Loved ones can prevent teen suicide by taking any threats seriously. True, some teens may threaten suicide as a way to act out, but you’re better off responding to these threats than finding out later that they were earnest. Many people who go forward with suicide gave some indicator to loved ones of their intentions. Don’t ignore these threats.

If you hear your teen threaten suicide or if you find a suicide letter, talk openly with them about it. Although they may not expressly ask you for help, you should offer it. You might ask, “You said that you would take your life. What caused you to feel this way? How can I help? Talk to me.”Some people worry that talking about suicide will lead to suicide, but talking about suicide saves lives. Be willing to have a conversation with your teen about your concerns.

, If you suspect that a teen may be contemplating suicide, you need to reduce their odds of completing the act. Immediately get rid of any prescription pills they may have access to. Similarly, lock up any weapons like guns or knives safely or remove them from the household entirely., Your teen needs to see a doctor or therapist for suicidal behavior. You might get a referral from your family doctor or research a mental health therapist online. If your teen seems to be in need of immediate help, call a suicide hotline or get them to an emergency department right away.In the meantime, do not leave your teen alone. Surround them with support and let them know that you will help them get the help they need.
Be sure to spend some time alone with this therapist as well. This will give you an opportunity to work through your feelings on the situation and get guidance about how to address the situation in a healthy way. Be sure to make time to take care of yourself as well.

, Many teens who have suicidal thoughts and feelings can prevent an attempt by creating a suicide safety plan. This serves as a contract that they develop with their families and mental health providers. The plan might include a list of actions a teen can take when feeling suicidal like calling a hotline, seeking support from a parent or friend, practicing stress management techniques. They sign the contract saying that they will try these steps if they think about harming themselves., Teens who are at risk of suicide may pull away, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need or want support. Share your concern for their well-being and point out various individuals they can go to in a crisis. Talk in a gentle, non-accusing way, letting your teen know that you do not blame them for these feelings.

For example, you might say, “I’m so sorry that you are feeling this way, but I’m glad we are talking about it. Your father and I are here for you. We are ready to talk anytime you need. Plus, if you don’t want to talk to us you can call your counselor or a hotline. We want to make sure you know you are not alone in this.”Ask your teen to specifically identify who they are comfortable talking with about this.

, Since many teens who consider suicide have an underlying mental illness, they can benefit from positive lifestyle behaviors. In addition to strong social support, eating nutritious foods, getting plenty of exercise, and sleeping about 8 to 9 hours each night are healthy choices that can counteract stress and depression.Everyone can benefit from a better diet, exercise and sleep habits, so make it a family commitment.
Also, make sure to encourage your teen to engage in activities that they enjoy and are passionate about, such as a hobby, sport, or other special interest.

Understand pregnancy.,
Learn about sexually transmitted diseases.,
Use condoms.,
Consider birth control pills.,
Track the fertility cycle.,
Research other forms of birth control.",How to Have a Healthy Sex Life (Teens)1," Whether you are male or female, you should educate yourself about pregnancy before any heterosexual activity. Here are a few basics that all sexually active people should know about pregnancy:


Pregnancy can occur anytime that semen enters the vagina. Almost all pregnancies result from unprotected penetrative sex, with the penis in the vagina.
Pregnancy is extremely unlikely during oral sex, anal sex, or non-penetrative sexual activities.Precum (a fluid the penis releases in small amounts when aroused) typically does not contain viable sperm. Unlike semen, precum is unlikely to cause pregnancy.;
, All types of unprotected vaginal, oral, and anal sex can spread sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).You can only get an STD by sharing fluids with someone already infected. However, many people have an STD that does not cause visible symptoms, and this can still be transferred during sex and cause major health problems (such as female infertility). The Center for Disease Control recommends annual STD testing for sexually active women under 25, and for men who have sex with men.Men who do not have sex with men are at lower risk, but should still be tested after risky sexual behavior.


Some STDs can take six months or longer to show up on a test.
If you and your sexual partner only have sex with each other, you only need to be tested once. Get tested again if you suspect your partner has had sex with someone else, or if either of you have used injected drugs with a shared needle.

, Condoms are the most common method of birth control among teens.They are cheap, easy to use, and protect you from both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Make sure you are using them correctly. Male condoms reduce pregnancy chance to 2% per year when used perfectly, but during typical use, mistakes or lapses increases this to 18%.Female condoms are slightly less effective, reducing the chance to 5% when used correctly. Do not use a female and male condom at the same time.Using condoms and one of the methods below is an excellent way to protect yourself and your sexual partner.

, Birth control pills are very effective at preventing pregnancy when a woman takes one every day.They do not protect against STDs. ""The pill"" is available over the counter in many countries. In the U.S., you need a doctor's prescription.


U.S. law prevents your doctor from telling your parents about your birth control. However, they may find out if you pay for it using your parent's health insurance. Birth control typically costs $15–$50 per month, so you and your sexual partner may be able to pay for it yourselves.These pills are very safe for most women, but may cause health issues if you have serious health issues related to your heart or blood. Smoking increases this risk.Birth control pills make your menstrual cycle more regular and may reduce unpleasant side effects, such as acne and cramping.

, Women are most fertile during ovulation and for a few days afterward. This usually happens on days 11–21 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, where day 1 is the start of menstrual flow.It's important to realize that most women do not have regular cycles, so you can't predict exactly when this happens in advance. This tells you when pregnancy is especially risky, but you shouldn't skip protection at other times of the month.


Sperm can survive for a few days in the vagina, so sex before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy.
To track this, keep a menstrual cycle calendar with signs of an approaching period. If you want to be extra safe, track your ovulation.

, There are many other forms of birth control available, from diaphragms to intrauterine devices. For more information, visit a reproductive health center such as Planned Parenthood, or talk to a doctor or gynecologist. Teens are exposed to many myths about birth control and STDs, so don't assume everything you've heard is true.


The withdrawal method, where the man pulls out before ejaculation, is not recommended by most experts. While it does reduce pregnancy somewhat when followed correctly, there is a risk the man will not pull out in time, or change his mind after sex has started. This method also offers no protection against STDs."

Decide whether you're ready for sex.,
Avoid sex for the wrong reasons.,
Talk with your partner.,
Plan ahead.,
Take your time.,
Go as far as you are comfortable.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Let each other change your mind.,
Talk about the experience with your partner afterwards.,
Understand healthy anal sex.",How to Have a Healthy Sex Life (Teens)2," Take some time alone to think through this decision. Ideally, you should answer ""yes"" to all these questions before you have sex:Do you and your partner understand how pregnancy and STDs work? Can you talk openly about the risk, and agree on a method or methods of protection?
Do you and your partner trust and respect each other? Would your partner listen if you changed you mind and said ""stop""?
Are your personal values compatible with the sexual experience you're considering?
Would your family and community be okay with this if they knew? If you answer ""no,"" are you comfortable accepting that fact?

, Sex can be a great way for two people in a healthy relationship to have fun and express their connection. This isn't always the reason sex happens, however. Be honest about why you want to have sex, and understand which reasons are no good:Only have sex when you and your partner genuinely want to. If one of you is pressuring the other, put this to a stop and wait until both of you are ready.
Don't have sex because you think everyone else is doing it. Most high school students have not had sex, and the ones that do don't have sex very often.
Don't have sex to save a failing romantic relationship. It won't work.

, Once you're confident you're ready for sex, talk to your partner. You need to talk about previous sexual experiences, possible STDs, what to do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, and your views on abortion and adoption. Tell each other why you want to have sex. If you cannot talk to your partner about these topics, you may want to postpone sex until the two of you are able to have the conversation.


Make sure you're on the same page about what sex means to your relationship. Is it just for fun? Do you love each other? Is this an exclusive relationship?

, If it's the first time for one or both of you, or even just your first time with each other, you're going to need privacy and time to yourselves. Arrange your agreed-upon method(s) of protection in advance, so you don't miss an opportunity.


Finding privacy can be difficult, but try not to do it in your car. This is illegal in some areas. Try to restrict yourselves to one of your homes, while there are no other people around.

, There is nothing worse than a rushed first time. Go slow, and explore each other's bodies. Foreplay is necessary to help you become aroused and comfortable. This is especially important for women, as arousal causes the vagina to become lubricated. Without lubrication, penetration can cause significant pain.

, A sexual encounter can mean playing with each other with your clothes on, helping each other masturbate, or having penetrative sex. Enjoy each other however you both agree to.


Doing something once does not mean you have to do it again. You and your partner are allowed to have a different comfort level on a different day.

, Don't be mortified at a failure to orgasm, or at rapid ejaculation. These are common occurrences during first-time sex, or when you're feeling nervous. Also understand what a typical sexual experience is like, instead of believing what you hear in boasts, porn, or romance novels:


The typical man lasts five minutes during penetrative sex before ejaculating.Some women take longer to orgasm than their partner, or have trouble achieving orgasm from penile-vaginal sex alone. They can still enjoy sex and may choose to orgasm through assisted masturbation or non-penetrative sex.

, If you want to slow down or stop, say so. There's nothing wrong with feel nervous or uncomfortable, or even in pain. The best way to deal with this is to take a break and go back to something you're more comfortable with. You can try again when you feel ready, whether that means in five minutes or next month.


Continuing intercourse with a partner who asks you to stop is morally wrong, even if it began as consensual sex. In many regions, this is legally considered rape or sexual assault.

, Did you enjoy yourselves? Was there anything that you especially enjoyed, or that made you uncomfortable? The more you can talk about it, the more comfortable you'll be with each other, and the more enjoyable your next sexual experience will be, if you decide to do it again.

, Among some heterosexual teenage groups, most anal sex happens when men pressure or coerce women into trying it.Do not try anal sex if you do not want to. Understand that it is generally more painful than vaginal sex. Relaxation exercises and water-based lubrication can improve the experience.Roughly 10% of heterosexual couples and 66% of male homosexual couples (in the UK) practice anal sex regularly.

Don't go all the way.,
Engage in heavy petting.,
Engage in non-penetrative sex.,
Engage in oral sex.",How to Have a Healthy Sex Life (Teens)3," You've determined that you enjoy being sexual with your partner, but are still not ready to have sex. Perhaps you're just not ready now, or you may have decided that you want to wait until marriage before you engage in sexual intercourse.


If you are avoiding sex for religious or cultural reasons, understand that some of the practices in this section may be considered sex by your community's standards.

, What is it? Heavy petting is erotic contact between two people that stops short of penetrative sex (vaginal, anal, or oral). The risk of disease and pregnancy are greatly reduced, though there is still a very small risk in either case, depending on the level of intimate contact.

, This can range from all-clothes-on ""dry humping,"" to all-clothes off touching sessions including mutual masturbation and sexual satisfaction. Because orgasm is generally part of the process, it's safe to say this is sexual activity, and does carry a low risk of pregnancy or disease. However, neither result is likely.


Neither partner should feel obligated to perform other sexual acts to avoid intercourse.

, While oral sex can be pleasurable for both partners, it is not without its risks. Pregnancy is not an issue, but disease transmission is still possible.


The CDC reports that over 60% of U.S. residents between the ages of 15 and 24 have had oral sex, compared to about 50% who have had vaginal intercourse.The CDC study also reports that patients visiting STD clinics have shown that 5-10% have gonorrhea in the throat, and can raise the risk for infection by chlamydia, herpes, syphilis, and cancer-linked HPV, and recommends using safe sex techniques when performing oral sex.

Refrain from having sex.,
Enjoy the make-out session but keep your limits firmly in place.,
Break off the make-out session if it gets too hot for either of you to handle.,
Understand the risks.",How to Have a Healthy Sex Life (Teens)4," This may seem counter-intuitive to an article on having a healthy sex life, but consider this: if 2/3s of teenagers are engaging in sex, that means 1/3 are not. Also, abstinence does not mean not feeling sexual: it means not having sex. If this is the choice you and your partner have made, then do not be ashamed of it. Neither should you be ashamed to have sexual urges with your partner—it would be unnatural not to. There are some things you can do to help calm those urges, and still share the kinds of intimacies that people in love share:

, If his (or her) wandering hands land where you don't want them, don't just try to block the move with your body language: move them away with your own hands, and say ""No, I'm not ready for that."" They should get the idea immediately, and respect you enough to stop that approach.

, It's completely natural to feel desire, but it's not required that you act on that. If you find yourself suddenly overwhelmed with passion, but are committed to remaining chaste for now, simply back off a bit and say something like ""wow, that's hot, but I'm not ready to go further right now. Let's go watch a movie.""


If your partner doesn't understand, or is insistent, don't be surprised: they may not be quite as ready to stop as you are, and might be a little confused and flustered. However, if they remain insistent, or demanding, or even attempt emotional blackmail such as ""If you loved me you would keep going,"" send them home to cool down, and re-think if you want to be in that situation with them again.

, Surprisingly, abstinence actually has a higher failure rate than condoms in preventing STDs and pregnancy. This doesn't mean you can get pregnant from kissing, of course. What this means is that a large number of abstaining teens lose their resolve and have some form of sex in the heat of the moment, often without protection. Educate yourself about pregnancy and STDs. Understanding these risks can help you stick to your plan, or run out and buy a condom if you change your minds.

, Gratitude is a simple way to make you appreciate your life so much more. There's nothing wrong with having dreams or goals, but in the meantime, enjoy what you have... even though it may not be much.

, When you have the chance to improve yourself or try something new, don't sit around at home and wonder and think about the pros and cons. Just jump in with two feet and do it! New experiences are a great way to help you enjoy your life.

See a professional.",How to Handle Resentment Against Someone," Pinpoint the actual feelings you are having and why you are having them. Try to understand yourself. When did these feelings of resentment start? Was there one event or several that caused you to feel this way? Is your resentment relating to one person, such as a partner, or to several people, like your parents or family?


Recognizing the root of your resentment will help direct you in how to overcome it. For example, if you feel resentful because someone close to you disappointed you or let you down, your solution may be to change your expectations about people. Obviously, you cannot change other people, so the resolution lies in changing yourself or learning to accept what has happened.;
, Sometimes, we are resentful of others because we are upset that we made ourselves vulnerable enough to get hurt. Deep down, we may feel confused or embarrassed that we did not somehow see this situation coming. We feel rage that we let our guards down and trusted someone who hurt us. In a sense, we get angry with ourselves for being human.As one quote vividly states, ""resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die."" You have the power to either move on from resentment or stay in this place of bitterness. Recognize your power and avoid putting all the blame on the other person.

, Coveting or feeling that you should possess what another has, whether superficial or innate, can lead to bitter feelings. If you are resentful towards someone because they have something you wish you had, then it is unhelpful to take these feelings out on this person. You need to come to terms with what you feel is lacking in your life in order to overcome this form of resentment.An example of envy that leads to resentment is becoming angry at a coworker who received the promotion you were vying for. Perhaps you felt you were entitled to the promotion because you've been on the job longer.
Overcome envious resentment by being honest with yourself and taking action. Is it this person that is really making you angry or is it some aspect of yourself? If you truly feel your performance deserves a second look, you can actively speak with your supervisors about other positions that might become available. Or, if you think you have outgrown your current employer, you might try to find a suitable position elsewhere.
You are not envious of that person, but of some trait or ability that the person has. Sit down and do an honest evaluation of your feelings and channel that jealousy to improving yourself., Anger and resentment are powerful feelings. Oftentimes, we can do more damage to ourselves by pretending these feelings are not there or trying to push them away. Resentment happens because we are running from our feelings about the situation, so we displace them by developing hatred or grudges for the offending person. We must accept our feelings in order to heal.


Anger often masks various other emotions that are harder to understand or show. People display anger because it is easier to appear angry than revealing that we feel rejected, disappointed, jealous, confused, or hurt.
Take a moment to yourself and not only think about what happened to you, but also really feel all the emotions that accompany this situation. Feel mad if you are mad. Acknowledge your pain or confusion. Do not push these feelings away. Only by truly feeling what you feel can you move on from here.

, Find somebody you can talk to and tell this person what happened that upset you so much. Talking over your feelings with another can help you to see the situation more objectively. Another individual may be able to see patterns in your behavior that were instrumental in what happened, and assist you in brainstorming a solution. It's always good to have people you can talk to.

, Write down the situation or situations in as much detail as you can remember, leaving out nothing. When you have done that, write down the traits of this person that you resent. Don't just call them names just for the sake of insulting this person. Are they self-absorbed, rude, cruel, disrespectful? Think about what they have done and consider what category of disrespect this falls under.Next, write down how this person's behavior made you feel, taking note to not just use anger but look deeper to what's beneath the anger.
Finally, note in which ways this behavior and your feelings about it have affected your life. For example, if your partner cheated, you might feel angry, sad, and confused. Your partner's cheating has caused you to have trouble trusting or connecting with others for fear that they may hurt you, too.

, In some situations, when someone we love has hurt us, we have the desire to understand. True enough, gaining understanding as to why someone hurt you won't make the situation go away – and the person may not even know why they did it – but having a candid discussion about what happened is a step towards healing.Ask the person to meet up with you to talk. Using ""I"" statements, like, ""I was hurt by ____,"" express your feelings about the situation. After you have done so, without being critical, ask if the person can try to explain the situation from their point of view.
Only confront the person after you have gained an objective perspective of the situation, meaning you have recognized your role and faced your feelings.
If you think you will continue having a relationship with this person, explain to the person how important it would be to you to receive and apology, or ask for specific reparations. For example, if your partner had an indiscretion, and you have decided to stay with this person, you should set boundaries and guidelines for what you expect of their future behavior.

, Rumination refers to rethinking a situation over and over again, allowing it to remove you from the present moment and make you feel negatively. Rumination is at the foundation of resentment. Therefore, in order to let go of rumination, you must first learn to manage your thoughts. Three ways to overcome rumination include:Focus on the solution rather than the problem. This is a healthy and future-oriented way of dealing with resentment. Dwelling on what happened gets you nowhere. Making a plan to learn from the situation helps you to grow from it. Write down a few ways you can resolve this circumstance, such as increasing your stress management skills or reevaluating your expectations of others.
Look twice at your analysis of the situation. Sometimes, we hold resentments based on perceived faults. The other person may not even know they did anything wrong, or if they did, they never intended to hurt you. Try to look at your situation realistically. Are you expecting the other person to have read your mind?
Focus on your strengths. If another person has hurt you, you may be spending an enormous amount of time scrutinizing your flaws. Try to identify strengths you have that might pertain to the situation. For example, if one friend disappointed you, a strength may be that you have other friends with whom you still have a good relationship. One potential strength of yours might be choosing to forgive a person despite any wrongdoing.

, This may be the last thing you want to do, but trying to acknowledge good characteristics about the person who hurt you is useful towards you moving on but also looking at the situation more objectively. Human beings make mistakes and no human is all bad. Everyone has good qualities worth highlighting; look for those in this person.

, Wounds caused by those we care about can have a lasting impact. However, holding on to grudges prevents you from healing and growing. Choose to forgive the person who hurt you. Forgiving doesn't mean you have to continue to keep this person in your life. It also does not mean that you have to forget about what happened. Forgiveness just means you will choose to release this person from your anger, and you will release these negative feelings that you have been holding. Forgiveness makes you a better person.Forgiveness can take on many forms, but ultimately it means letting go of resentments. You might simply say aloud, after processing your feelings about the situation, that you are not going to hold a grudge. Say, ""I forgive you."" Tell the person face-to-face, if you will continue to have them in your life.
After having written down your account of what happened, tear the paper into pieces or toss it into your fireplace. Remove the power this person has over you by choosing to forgive them and move on.
Practice self-compassion. In addition to granting forgiveness to this other person, you must also strive to forgive yourself. Give yourself the same courtesy that you would extend to others. You are worthy of forgiveness, too.Make a verbal motion to forgive yourself and practice self-compassion. Stand in front of the mirror and say, ""I love you,"" ""I am only human,"" ""I am a work in progress,"" or ""I am enough.""

, If you are a spiritual person, attempt to find meaning in the situation you endured. Did this happen to you so that you can bear witness for others? Can your predicament be a source of inspiration or encouragement for someone else? Furthermore, depending on your beliefs, it may be damaging to your spiritual health to have bitterness towards another. Pray, meditate, or speak with a spiritual advisor about moving on from resentment.

, If you are having trouble forgiving and moving on from resentments, you may need to seek the assistance of a mental health professional. Holding on to anger and grudges can affect your mental, physical, and emotional health. You may require treatment for anger management or cognitive behavioral techniques to help you overcome rumination."

Listen to your parents.",How to Have a Good Teen Life," As simple as this may be, a healthy social life is the key to enjoying your life in spite of the stress of school. Shop with friends; enjoy buying clothes and accessories. Go to a theme park, water park, or a few trips. Try to make at least two best friends, and try to make many friends from your gender and two or three the opposite gender for diversity. Go to arcade places, bowling, or teen clubs and places; this will be the best interaction with other teenagers or people around your age.;
, Sew, read, play computer games, draw, or do yoga. Get a and/or Facebook account, but try not to get addicted to it. Make videos with your friends and post them on YouTube. Check online to see the hottest new music and the coolest new artists and songs of your genre of choice. You don't have to be a fan of pop music only; if you like to listen to your grandma's '50s doo wop albums or some nice relaxing smooth jazz or Bob Marley, go ahead Be a fan of your favorite sports team. Find whatever you enjoy doing and do it! Start a movie or book collection.

, Show off your talents. Write music, write stories and poems, create cool drawings, learn how to create web pages and computer programs, create your own clothes, cook, bake, work on a car, play an instrument, etc.

, Get cable TV and watch shows and films of your preference; family-style programming such as Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, ABC Family and WGN, or maybe intense drama the likes of Burn Notice or Justified. Maybe you can watch some classics such as Little House on the Prairie and Gunsmoke, even if they are from your parents or grandparents generation. If you are more of a carefree, lighthearted person, maybe anime or animated sitcoms such as Family Guy or The Simpsons will be good for you. Get an Xbox 360, PS3 or a Wii to play fun and interactive games in your spare time. Most importantly, get a mobile, PDA, iPod, PSP, MP3 player, iPhone, BlackBerry, or digital camera. Ask for these for your birthday or on Christmas, or any other day you celebrate.

, Be yourself and see what looks good on you (makeup and clothing attire). Whether it's face makeup (lip gloss and mascara) or body lotion, you got to be decent out the door, right?

, Eat healthy foods and use junk foods either in moderation or as a treat. Try to have a good amount of water in your system and eat at least one big meal a day; more if you have high metabolism or in sports.

, Always turn in your homework on time and do well on tests. Education is the most important thing in your life; doing poorly, not trying, or dropping out of school can hurt your future in a significant way. If you are getting bad grades because you are struggling with something, get help. But if you are just being lazy, or procrastinating, it can certainly affect your college and career opportunities in the future.

, School has many things for you to become involved in and have fun doing. Getting involved will help you in future years(look good on your college application) and you'll meet a lot of people. Like chess? You can be in the chess club, if the school doesn't have a club you wish you were in (say bowling club) you can create your own! This will help you be motivated in school.

, Yes, as crazy as it sounds, it will make your life so much more easy and enjoyable if you just listen to your parents, so you don't have to hear them keep yelling at you! Obeying them will actually be an easy way into getting what you want, remember it has to be a 50/50 cooperation, not 80/20. You parents might be not be as up to date as you, but they may give you good timeless advice. They are in the real world, not the ""surreal teen world"". They had been teenagers just like you and you don't want to know what they did in high school, but they had learned from their mistakes which makes them the stodgy parents you have today. Just wait, you'll become the stodgy parent too when you have your own kids.

Acknowledge any role that you may have played in these and also look at other factors that may have been at play.


The point of this is not to point fingers or lay blame on any one. Understand that you have some control over the quality of your life.;
, Look at things that may have gone wrong in the past and look at your behavior then and now. Forgive yourself. Are there any lessons that you can draw from them? Write them down. Is there anything you’re doing that you know will have consequences that you will regret later? Instead, do something that will be of benefit to you later, or at the very least will not cause any harm.


You will have to exercise some discipline. It’s easy to repeat behavior just because it’s familiar, it’s what you’re used to doing in a particular situation. For example, if you’re used to eating lots of sweet things and now you have diabetes, it will take time to adjust to your eating habits.

, Take the lessons you’ve learned, and carry on with life. As your past defined your present, your present will define your future. What you do now, will affect your future.


Allow yourself to fully feel any grievance you may have for the past. For a friendship that went sour or for a project you set out to do that didn’t work out the way you wanted. Write about it or discuss it with someone you trust. Express your view on the matter and why you’re upset about it. This will help you better understand your situation.Accept that what’s done is done and that you can only deal with the here and now.Forgive yourself for your mistakes and if you can, make amends with others.
Internalizing this may take longer than a day. Your choices, habits and behavior in the past made who you are today. It will take time to cultivate new habits that will make who you are tomorrow.

, Make sure you know not just what you stand for but also what you don’t. Being true to yourself will give you inner peace.Make a list of ten rules that you live by. These will give you an indication of what your values are.


For example, if one of your ‘rules’ is ‘I must never tell a lie’ then you value honesty. Or if one of your rules is ‘Never be rude to others’ then you value politeness.
Once you think you’ve defined your value, check to see if they really are your values. Look at how you make decisions on a daily basis. Do they truly reflect your values? If you break your ‘rules’ and you feel upset, guilty or distraught, then that rule most likely reflects your values.
Here is a list of values to help you define your values.

, Set your ambitions in line with your values. Where do you see yourself in five or ten years’ time? What can you do now that will help you achieve these ambitions? If you see yourself in a certain kind of job, research the kind of skills that you need for that. Find out how you can acquire them.


Think about your priorities and passions. Maybe your priority is to find a high-paying job so that you can support your family in the future. Or maybe your priority is to better the community in some way. Maybe your passion is writing, or your passion is maths.
Research how you can make your passion fulfill your priority. You most likely have an idea of a ‘dream future’ with a ‘dream job’. Start there. Search online for the skills, qualifications and experience you’ll need to get there. Read the biographies of people who you aspire to be like.
Plan your goals. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Find out what you’ll need to do in order to achieve each step.
Your ambitions may change over time. You only have control over your actions, not your circumstance.Make sure how you react and respond to your circumstances reflects your values. So long as your ambitions stay in line with your values, you will likely have a great future.

, Whenever you set out to do something in life, be sure you know your reasons for doing it. It’s very easy to slip into ‘autopilot’ or to do things just because others are doing it or because they’re telling you it’s the right thing to do.If you do not lead your life with purpose, you are less likely to achieve your goals.Questioning yourself will require monitoring the way you think and the things you do. Negative thinking styles will hinder your efforts to achieve your goals.Be sure to do this every night before you sleep if not constantly throughout the day. Self-monitoring will become habitual over time. , Taking care of your health now will improve your chances of seeing your future through. A healthy lifestyle includes healthful eating, physical activity, a regular sleep cycle, good hygiene habitsand actively making time to relax and destress.You will see the benefits of these in your present as well as your future; a healthy lifestyle will have psychological, social and physical benefits.Consult a nutritionist about the best kinds of food for your body type.Be sure to have balanced meals and to eat a full breakfast.Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.How much you need as you age will change and will be affected by other health factors such as your current weight and your heart condition.Consider asking a friend to join you in a sport you like or to start jogging together.
A good sleep cycle takes into consideration not just how much you sleep, but also when you sleep. The most restful sleep occurs at night with a nap during the day.Try to be in bed by 10.30 and to nap for an hour or so during the day.How much sleep you need will most likely vary depending on your level of activity, food intake and rest throughout the day.
Take care of your hair, your skin and your teeth. Self-grooming will boost your self-esteem and make you feel more fresh throughout the day.Experiment over time with which products and routines suit you best. Talk to a stylist or a dermatologist about how to take care of your hair and skin.

, Remember that the quality of work you put into an hour is more important than the number of hours you put into the work. The quality AND quantity of your work matter. Sometimes working for a long time on something gives you the illusion that you are getting a lot done when really you haven’t had a productive hour.Be open and honest with yourself about the quality of your work. If you need help, ask for it. Other people might be able to give you better tips on how to do something efficiently and effectively.

, Working smarter means taking small breaks while you work and also making a point to schedule relaxing activities into your day. This improves your creativity and productivity and lowers your stress levels.One popular study recommends working for 52 minutes and taking a 17-minute break to improve your productivity.Make it a point to do things that you find relaxing, such as yoga, meditation, painting or reading. Experiment with different activities to see which best suits you. What is relaxing to you may not be relaxing to someone else.

, It’s always smart to save money for the future now. Set aside an amount that you will save every month. Make a list of special circumstances or emergencies under which you will use this money.


If you are still studying, consider getting a part-time job. This will teach you the value of money and time, and instill responsibility and discipline in you., Be kind to people now. Build a network of people you can rely on for advice and support in the future. This includes your friends, people you work with who are higher in the command chain than you are, your peers and your mentors and teachers. Look to those with more experience than you for advice on how to work towards the future you dream of. Even if your idea is something that they don’t have personal experience of, they can still give you solid advice that applies to you.

, Being grateful has long-term benefits on your health, work, and social life.Every night before sleeping, think of the good things that have happened today. Include the things people have said and the things others have done for you. Reflect on the things you ate and the basic necessities you have. It’s easy to take these things for granted. Often, we are too busy thinking of the few negative experiences we have throughout the day to feel positive about the many good things.Sometimes, we suffer a great loss and need to grieve. Grieving does not necessarily mean that we are ungrateful and being grateful does not mean you’re not allowed to grieve. It’s a natural human process., It’s easy to adopt a negative outlook on life. Actively looking for the positive aspects of every situation will help you be grateful.It will help you criticize and complain less and appreciate more. If you find yourself in an unfavourable situation, ask yourself what you can learn from it.


If you find yourself in a generally low mood, look to your thoughts. What are you thinking? How are you thinking? Are you complaining about something? Are you blaming yourself or someone else for what happened? Ask yourself if what you’re thinking is based on fact or opinion. Is there truth to your thought? Think of other ways of looking at your situation.
This doesn’t mean that you’re not allowed to have negative thoughts. Everybody has negative thoughts occasionally. Believing all the negative thoughts to be true is what will have a negative impact on your life including lower mood and motivation to work for a great future., Make it a point to thank others who are a valuable part of your life or who have helped you do things to make a better future. Not only will this open the door to more beneficial relationships but will also improve your physical and mental health.Send thank you notes to professional acquaintances and be thoughtful and caring to those you’re close to.

Use your late teenage years and early 20s to start becoming more and more like the adult version of yourself. Your interests, talents, and skills will give you some sense of who you will become, so it's important to take your mid-to-late teenage years to explore those talents and dream your biggest dreams. What do you want to be? Who do you want to be? Explore yourself.


Use these years to play in bands, play sports, act in drama, paint, and read for pleasure. Explore things for which you have natural skills, as well as things you know nothing about. Try new hobbies and activities that are available, like photography or dance. You might learn that you're really great at something you never gave yourself credit for.;
, While you don't need to plan out your whole life in your early twenties, it's important to start giving some thought to what you want to do with the rest of your life. Do you want to go to college? Are you studying what you want to study and providing yourself a plan for the future? Do you want to start making money as soon as possible? Are you going to take your band on tour and live like a rock star? Are you going to travel? Make a list of your priorities and the things you want to make sure to accomplish in your young adulthood and start taking the steps to make them happen.



If you're interested in going to college, start researching possibilities, and thinking about what you'd like to study. Find local universities and colleges that might be a good fit, and find colleges that would be dream schools. Find out about how much it will cost, how much your family will be able to afford, how much you'll need to reserve with student loans, and the different cost breakdowns for different schools.

If you want to start working, spend time developing a budget for yourself, setting financial goals, and learning what kinds of jobs will be available to you to make the kind of money you'll need. Research the training and vocational skills you'll need for those types of jobs so you can start preparing now.

, In the interest of expanding your mind and learning more about the ways different people live in your world, it's important to see it up front and in person. Make it a priority to visit other places and spend time in other cultures as you enter adulthood. It can be a moving and significant experience for many young adults.


Traveling doesn't need to be a leisure activity for the privileged. If you work hard and can't afford to take a vacation to Italy, or study abroad, travel as best you can within your means. Visit interesting places in your own country that you've never seen. Visit neighborhoods within your own city that you don't spend time in. Be a tourist in your town.
World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) takes on willing laborers in a variety of countries throughout the world, giving you a chance to work your way across the world. Likewise, the Peace Corps, Americorps, or other humanitarian organizations provide service and travel experience. Help out, give back, and see new places.

, Give yourself a chance to socialize with as many different kinds of people as you can. Learn about yourself from spending time with hard-working and admirable people, and model your behaviors on people you respect. Maintain healthy relationships and you'll maintain your own sanity.



Find a work role model. At your job, find a person who negotiates the work environment in a way that you admire. Learn from them. If your colleague stays above the petty department politics, but still manages to let her work speak for itself, do the same. Collaborate and commiserate.

Find a life role model. As you grow older, it's easy to lose touch with old friends and to not make new friends. It's easy to wake up one day and realize the people you see every day are coworkers. Keep friends that do very different things than you, with whom you share mutual interests or hobbies. Maybe your record collecting buddy works HVAC, but that doesn't mean you can't relate to each other over the new crate-digging finds you made last weekend.

, As you get older, you'll gradually get to know yourself better. If you tend toward laziness, or tend to sweat the small stuff, or tend to procrastinate, these things shouldn't be a surprise by the time you reach your twenties and get ready to enter the work force. A teenager can get away with ignoring these things and calling it ""youth."" But an adult needs to get real and be honest about shortcomings, challenges, and places for growth. Growing up takes work.



Identify your strengths. What are you particularly good at, or skilled in? Take time to identify your personal strengths and the things you're proud of.

Identify your weaknesses. What needs some work? What keeps you from getting what you want? It's important to identify places in need of improvement, fixing up the foundation to keep the house of yourself strong.

, There's no adulthood button, so there's no clean break between childhood and adulthood. But growing up doesn't mean that you have to abandon your youth entirely, it just means that you have to control your childhood tendencies and learn to harness that youthful energy into more mature goals and ambitions. Recognize your childlike tendencies so you can use them to your advantage.



Child mode is chaotic. A child is disorganized, unprepared, and usually running a million miles an hour in the wrong direction. Childhood is chaos. While many adult lives are busy and full, chaos–the lack of control or structure for that stress and business–is a sure sign of child mode. Identify the parts of your life that are chaotic and channel your energy into organizing them.

Child mode is helpless. Someone needs to tie a child's shoes, feed the child, and offer emotional support. An adult is more self-reliant, capable of raising their own children because of an increasing degree of selflessness. As you grow up, work to become more capable of doing things yourself, and rely less on others.

Child mode is resentful. In child mode, you may grow to seethe in anger when another coworker gets a promotion and you don't, or when an old fling from high school gets married. Resent is the child mode equivalent of a temper tantrum. If you don't get your way, you can bury that frustration and let it grow into resentment and anger, like a child does, or you can express your frustration in a healthy way, reckon with the situation, and move on.

, Teenagers are impulsive. Teenagers say yes to another drink, a long night out, and blowing off work the next day to go on a road trip. Becoming an adult means that you need to learn to draw your own boundaries, pull back from the mentality of your youth, and stand up for yourself. If your friends are going to a music festival, but you're worried you won't be able to take off work, you've got to learn to say no. Being responsible sometimes means saying no.


The more you emphasize your long term goals by making short-term decisions that will move you in the right direction, the more grown-up you'll be. Taking a day off work to play Halo with your college friend might be attractive, but if you blow any chance you'll have of ever getting a raise, you're actively keeping yourself from attaining your goals, a sign of immaturity.

, When you're going out, or working, keep the cargo shorts and the novelty t-shirts in the drawer. Men and women should wear clean professional clothes appropriate for the occasion. You don't have to throw out your ratty old stuff–keep your college gear safe for homecoming week and Saturdays to let yourself feel young.

, An adult can't eat Ramen and macaroni and cheese with hot dogs for breakfast anymore. When you shut the door on college, shut the door on your ways of eating and dressing.



Exercise and eat responsibly. The freshman 40 are no joke. When kids run off to college, it's a regular thing to stop playing sports and start eating whatever you want, all the time. The weight goes on and it can be very difficult to shake the habit of bad eating and no exercise. Don't let the freshman 40 turn into a yearly thing.

, Becoming an adult means learning to deal with failure and learning to persevere in spite of it. You can't crumble when something doesn't go the way you want, or expect it to.


A hard truth about the world: just because you deserve something does not mean that you'll get it. Keep your goals in sight, stay happy, and do not let the unfairness of life demoralize you. Life is hard and everyone else has had to overcome obstacles, yourself included., When you become an adult, though, it's common to move around, to leave old friends behind and form new ones. It can be difficult to know what relationships are long-term and what are circumstantial. Differentiate between them, and take active steps to maintain the relationships you want to keep. Stay in touch, visit, and stay invested in your good friends' lives.As you enter adulthood, it's common to have longer-term romantic relationships as well. If you're more keen on dating and playing the field, try to settle in for a couple months to see if you don't feel more comfortable. If you tend toward the long-term, don't be afraid to end relationships that have grown stale, just because you like the security. Know yourself.

, Take active steps to deepen your understanding of people very different than yourself. Teenagers often think of themselves as open-minded in comparison to their parents, only to realise later in their 20s that they grew up with long-held assumptions based on class, race, gender, and other factors. Becoming an adult means learning to understand and empathise with others.


Hang around people much older than you and learn everything you can from them. Teenagers often sneer at people over 30, but adults know wisdom when they see it. At work, in your community, and in other social interactions, make it a priority to seek out members of the generations previous to yours and try to get some of their wisdom to rub off. Pal up to the employee who's been at your job the longest, or the member of your church who's the oldest.
Read extensively, and learn about other perspectives: Read a variety of political ideologies before committing yourself too closely and identifying with one.

, If you say you'll do something, do it. Maintaining relationships, jobs, and moving forward in the world will be difficult if you're not seen as a reliable person. Teenagers and kids can get away with messing up all the time—they're kids! But adults need to act like adults. People need to know they can rely on you.


Always treat friends, family, and coworkers with respect. Treat people the way you want to be treated. If you don't have respect for others, they will most likely lose the respect they have for you. It may not always come back to you but you will get a lot farther in life and be much happier.

, The body gets less durable. Also, what may seem like good-natured mischief and debauchery when you're in college can start to seem desperate addictive behavior when you're pushing 30. When your day starts to revolve around partying, and when you've got to call off work because you're too partied out, it's time to grow up.


All things in moderation: Getting older doesn't mean you can't have fun, it just means you've got to plan it out a little more. Get a sitter, clear out your schedule for the next day, and show the young kids how it's done.

, Don't make excuses when your boss tells you that your work hasn't been up to snuff, or when your partner remarks on your self-hygiene as of late; take it with a grain of salt.


Being non-defensive doesn't mean you should avoid defending yourself, or become a doormat for other peoples' aggression. Rather, an emotionally mature person can receive good-natured negative criticism without becoming defensive or indignant. Be open to being wrong, but stand up for yourself when the time is right. Learning to distinguish is part of growing up.

, Unless you're a trust-funder, you're going to need to work as you enter adulthood. Some start working earlier, during high school, while some wait until college or even after college, to start working. There's no right time to start, but adjusting to employment is an essential step in adulthood.


A part-time job can be an excellent way of building necessary work skills and making supplementary income, even if your parents are still shouldering you financially. Gradually work toward a more self-reliant way of making money, however.

, It might be tempting to blow your first couple paychecks on a Gibson Les Paul and two tickets to Cabo, but that's the way a teenager spends money. Put that money in the bank and start saving it. Establish a balanced budget that will allow you to live comfortably, taking into account necessary expenses for each month, as well as savings and disposable income. Try to balance your financial obligations in the here-and-now with taking necessary steps to reach your long-term goals.


Monthly expenses include rent, bills, and food. Most of them you'll have a fairly solid idea about, and try to budget slightly more for food than you may actually need. If you're not sure, keep close track of how much money you spend in an average week on food, then multiply times four.
Try to save some money as soon as possible, if you can. Putting away a certain percentage of your paycheck every month into a savings account can start to accumulate significantly over the years and months. Even if you can only afford to throw in 50 bucks, you're still taking a necessary step toward adulthood.

, When you leave your parents' house, it's possible to enter into a difficult in-between time. It's very difficult to become completely financially independent straight out of school, or during school, but you can start taking small steps to work ever toward financial freedom and responsibility. Your goal should be close budgeting, and relying on no one else for financial aid.


Good first steps are paying your own utilities bills and rent, then trying to pick up your phone bill, your car payments, and other expenses along the way. Slowly transition into taking care of yourself financially., Pay your bills on time and starting taking advantage of manageable credit opportunities to begin establishing a record of credit. Every time you sign a lease, put your name on a utility bill, or make a timely credit card payment, you're working to establish a credit record that will help you down the road in taking out a loan to buy a house, or make other big purchases and investments.


Young people are often notoriously bad when it comes to using credit cards. It's not free money. Don't run up a big bill on your credit card and say that you'll worry about it later. Consider making regular purchases with a credit card, if you qualify for one, and pay off the balance immediately with money you already have. Treat a credit card like a debit card to avoid getting in over your head.
Make loan payments, bill payments, and other payments on time. Don't waste money needlessly on late fees by setting up auto-debit functions online for each of your monthly bills and keeping close records of your budget.

, Put extra money into a savings account and don't touch it just because you can. It's easy to find a reason to throw your extra money away on a new-model Dodge Challenger, but consider your long term financial goals and keep that money in the bank.


When you can, it's a good idea to start a 401k and begin saving for retirement. Most businesses help their employees start to save money for retirement by providing the opportunity to start a savings account in which you can put money before taxes, which the company will then match a certain percentage of, in addition.

, Simply put: buy things that you can afford, and plan out how you'll pay for them before you make the purchase. Don't put things on credit if you're not sure how quickly you'll be able to pay off the debt, and don't rack up huge debts when you're only making the minimum monthly payment each month with your credit card.


It's hard to do things like buy a house, pay college tuition, or make big automotive purchases strictly on a cash basis, so it'll be likely that you'll end up with some amount of loan debt at some point in your life. Speak with a financial advisor to learn which option and interest rate works best for you, and work with them to get the smartest package for your financial situation.

Consolidate your debt, if you can. Paying multiple loan payments each month can get confusing and frustrating, especially if you're not putting enough toward paying down the principal, drawing out the process.

, As you grow older, a marker of maturity is your willingness to take on new responsibilities and stand up for your work. Be ambitious.


Volunteer for leadership roles at your job, if an opportunity presents itself. Don't worry about whether or not you'll be the perfect choice for a particular position.
While you should cultivate an ambitious reputation at your job and in your relationships, don't be afraid to turn down requests that don't line up with your goals for yourself. Being ambitious doesn't mean taking on everything that falls in your lap, but that you actively create opportunities to advance toward your long-term goals.

Set reminders.,
Maintain a routine.,
Stick to a schedule.",How to Get Your Life Back on Track1," Organize your life more clearly by keeping a schedule so that you will know where and when you are supposed to be somewhere. This will prevent last minute decisions and keep you active and on track.Keep track of your exercise routine, when you are meeting family or friends, or even when the dog needs groomed. Everything can be organized to keep you moving forward.
Take advantage of time-management web applications (or mobile apps) like Google Calendar to schedule out your daily activities, pay bills, or making appointments. The best part is you can adjust reminder settings so that you the calendar can alert you to do something.
Calendars are available just about everywhere nowadays, even on phones. Take advantage of these services and become familiar with them so it becomes routine.;
, Routines are generally good because we do things – brush our teeth, get a shower, comb our hair – because they are good for us and you don’t have to think about doing them. Unfortunately, the same is true for bad habits. It is a good idea to reevaluate the habits in your routine and remove them from your life and replace them with more positive ones.It is easier to create goods habits than trying to quit bad habits. Therefore, think of any bad habits you have in your routine and replace them the exact opposite habits. That way, your daily routine stays familiar and your new, good habits naturally (over time) replace the bad ones.
The benefit of a routine is maintaining the type of lifestyle you want without all the added pressures in making the right decisions. So, you will want to practice healthy and productive habits to make sure your life stays on track.
When thinking about the habits of your routine take time to visualize what you want your life to look like on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis and take the necessary steps to make it part of your healthy routine.

, Skipping important dates, extending deadlines, and finishing tasks at the last second creates havoc. This type of lifestyle leads to missed opportunities to grow as an individual and miss meeting friends and colleagues for work and social functions. You will also see work piling up at your desk at work.Try not to miss even the small things. Of course, it is okay if you slip up once in a while but if you continue to miss many small things it adds up quickly and you get derailed once again.
When a routine or activity cannot be fully completed, try to do as much of it as you possibly can so that it remains part of your schedule.
For example, if you cannot exercise, then walk fast to wherever you going; not enough time to write an article, then write a paragraph; and no time to cook dinner, then just make a salad.

Look for job or volunteer opportunities.",How to Grow Up and Get a Life," If you're feeling inadequate or immature, it probably stems from not finding and pursuing your true talents. Part of becoming an adult, in this sense, is reaching a degree of independence. Start by trying several jobs or activities to find what you're naturally skilled at. For example, you might volunteer at a hospital and discover that you're great at working with people or handling difficult situations. This might lead you to pursue a career that's people-oriented.


Studies suggests that the people who are happiest with their lives find their natural talents and pursue them.This is more important than choosing a career based on popularity or income.;
, Since no two people ever follow the exact same life path, your own development as a person will be unique. This can be difficult to appreciate since people live in communities and societies that often have expectations and age-related milestones. For example, your society might expect you to get an education, find a job, and start a family, in that order. Or, you might be expected to care for a family member instead of starting off on your own.


It can be hard to know what to do when social expectations conflict with what you'd like to do with your life. Remember that research suggests that those who are happiest with their lives aren’t necessarily those who chose their career path based upon its prestige., Find which activities, people, or things make you act with the most enthusiasm and passion. This will help you feel more independent and competent in your daily life. Avoid simply acting on an impulse. Instead, give some thought to what you're already motivated by and learn to use these abilities.For example, you may realize that you're passionate about teaching others. Use this knowledge to look for opportunities to use that enthusiasm. You may tutor classmates, teach in a school, or go to school to become an educator.

, Start by making a list of as many happy situations you can remember. Write down as many details regarding the events as you can remember. A list will help you figure out what it was about these situations that made you happy or energetic. You may notice that you were with the same few people. Or, maybe you found that you enjoy figuring out challenges. Since different things make different people happy, it's important that you know what you enjoy.For example, your list might have something like playing video games, playing the drums, or painting. This might lead you to realize that you're happiest when you're working with your hands.

, This is especially true if you're a young adult, relying on your parents to support you. Take steps to take care of yourself and your needs. This might mean getting a job to support yourself financially. Or, if you notice you're lonely, schedule time with friends to get some company.Avoid relying on others to take care of you and look after your needs. Part of growing up is recognizing that you are the one that's responsible for you.
Once you're supporting yourself, it will become easier to make your own decisions and stand by them.

, While you're growing up, others often make all your decisions for you, be they major or minor ones. Part of becoming your own person is moving to make your own choices. You might start with smaller choices, like which classes to sign up for in school or where you want to eat. Gradually, start making larger life decisions for yourself.For example, if you're unhappy in your job, you can decide to quit or change careers. Or, if you're tired of living with your parents or a roommate, you can decide to move out on your own.

, Once you know what makes you passionate and happy, look for jobs or volunteer opportunities. For example, if you realize you’ve always enjoyed talking to your grandparents, you might try to find work with an organization that assists the elderly in some capacity. Or, if you're interested in video games, you could look into becoming a computer programmer or video game designer.


Look for opportunities that will make you happy in the long term. Ask yourself where you see yourself in five or ten years. Then, consider whether job or volunteer offers fit into that picture., Discovering yourself is an important part of growing up and creating your own life, but you need to include others too. Research has shown that when you network with others about your passions, your passions are supported or enhanced.Regardless of what your passions are, you can find a local or digital community that share similar interests. You may even find that networking creates job opportunities that allow you to focus entirely on your interests.


For example, if you're motivated to woodwork, you might look for a local group that meets to share a workshop. They may be able to offer you advice on honing your skill and could even tell you about opportunities to sell your work.

, Part of growing up is developing strategies for self-care. This means being able to respect yourself and handle your emotional and physical needs. This way, you won't be overly dependent on others.For example, you should be eating a healthy diet, maintaining good physical health, getting enough rest, and creating respectful relationships.You'll also need to learn how to manage your desires and be happy without interfering with people who want to be left alone. For example, if you feel compelled to repair a relationship with a family member, but are refused, you'll need to learn how to move on without fulfilling that need.

, Create a daily routine, even if it's just a few simple acts, like showering when you wake up or making your own breakfast. Sometimes life can feel overwhelming when you try to change everything all at once.Start with those elements of your life over which you clearly have the most control. For example, you might try rearranging the furniture in your home, changing your hairstyle or attire, or maybe even getting in the habit of going on a walk around your neighborhood everyday.


If you want even more structure, sit down and write out everything you plan to do the next day and the time you’d like it done by. This will give you some sense of control over the changes in your life.

, The right kind of education can improve your life in many areas. You might make more money, learn more about yourself, expand your social network, and be more understanding of others.There are plenty of educational levels and opportunities available to you. Choose a program based on your interests, your finances, and your commitment to an educational program.


For example, you could attend a vocational program to learn a trade, get a 2-year associate's degree, get a 4-year bachelor's degree in a field of your choice, or even go on to graduate school.

, Whether you're looking for a romantic relationship or a friendly one based on mutual respect, relationships can enrich your life. Build a solid relationship through open communication, honesty, and dedication. Making a meaningful relationship won't happen overnight. Invest in the relationship by working through disagreements or rough situations, which shows you're in a mature relationship.Make sure you're available to the other person. If you're only there for the other person when it's convenient for you, the relationship isn't making you a stronger person, nor is it healthy for the other person.

, Chances are, you'll need to support yourself somehow. Find a job that challenges you, fulfills you, and that you enjoy. Realize that you may need to try several jobs before you find one that you really connect with. If you're not looking for a job, you'll still need something meaningful to fill your time. Look for volunteering opportunities within your community.


Volunteering is a great way to learn about yourself, people in your community who need help, and pick up new skills.It can make you feel more fulfilled and improve your social skills.

Whether you're in school, wanting a GED, or just graduated, it's important to see that there are lots of ways to get educated for a future career. Think outside the box. Seek advice from your school, a career counselor, or a mentor. There also lots of financial aid options out there if you look for them. Consider these educational opportunities:


High school diploma or GED
Community college to gain specific training or get an associate's degree
Four-year university or college
On the job training through apprenticeships
Trade or technical schools for information technology, healthcare, service repair, and others;
, It’s important to have dreams about ""what you want to be when you grow up."" But that also takes commitment and know-how. Even if you’re planning to be a professional athlete or a singer, you need to think critically and communicate well. No one will take you seriously if can't communicate effectively. If you speak and write well, you’re more likely to be hired. Communicating as a part of a team is essential.
Take your work and life seriously. Think critically when someone tries to convince you to do something, or give you ""a great deal."" Be smart in the way you handle yourself and your future.

, While you’re planning out your long-term future, remember that getting to that point will take many small steps in the job market first. You may think you’re better than working at McDonalds, or being a pizza delivery guy, but everyone starts somewhere. Consider these ways to look for jobs:


Go into local businesses where you think you'd be a good fit. Ask them if they are hiring. Fill out an application.
Talk with family and friends about jobs in the area. Network with people you know about job openings and qualifications.
Go to a career center, or see a guidance counselor. There may be people at your school who can help find out about local jobs for teens. Most cities have employment centers with people that can help you find a job or get training.
Go online, and see about jobs available through job search engines. Look at what the qualifications are to do the work. Think about ways to meet those qualifications if you don't have them already.

, Unless you live in a major city with easy access to public transit, having your own transportation will open doors to more jobs and opportunities outside of your immediate neighborhood. Find out if your family can assist with getting a car. If not, think about ways to get a job that will be focused on saving for a car.


Don’t waste your money on buying a fancy car. When you’re starting out, it’s about looking at your future long-term, not just what looks good today.
Your car should be a gateway to freedom, not a gateway to debt. Be careful and choose wisely.
If you have limited access to public transportation and cannot yet afford your own car, look into carpooling in your area or using something like ZipCar, Uber, or Lyft to get where you need to go.

, When you’re heading out on your own, it can be tough. Moving out of your family’s home and finding a place of your own takes some time, thought, and money. Before you start looking for a place, consider this:If you’re trying to get an apartment and you’re under 18, a parent or legal guardian may be required to be on the lease.
If you’re over 18 and looking for a place for yourself, many apartments require that you show employment or income that is at least 3x the rent. If you do not have a current job, you may be required to pay several months of rent upfront or have a co-signer on your lease.
Avoid choosing housing that has a lot of unnecessary perks that may drive up costs. Keep costs affordable. There may be online tools in your state or area to find more affordable housing.
Consider finding a room for rent rather than an entire apartment. You may be able to share utility costs and save on rent.
Be cautious of moving in with friends or family if you think they may not be responsible with money. Everyone on the lease is responsible if rent is not paid.

, There are lots of tempting things out there. Cars. Clothes. Jewelry. Tech gadgets. But the hard truth is that those things are often unnecessary luxuries that can be expensive, and if you’re not careful, you’ll run into debt. Debt is one of the biggest deterrents to independence and getting your life started.


With any money you earn, make sure to save more than 20% in a savings account. Open a bank account. Make sure to put some of your money into savings.Think before you spend. While it’s nice to have nice things, it’s important to pick your nice things wisely. Ask yourself if you really need it and if it's going to give you long-lasting enjoyment.
Save up for the big things, rather than buying something with credit. Bad credit can hurt your future. You will end up paying more for things like cars, furniture, electronics, and homes. Bad credit can even hurt you when you're looking for an apartment, or trying to get a job. Potential landlords and employers can legally use bad credit as a factor in their decisions., Think about what interests you, and the possible jobs associated with those interests. Think about your personality, and what you think might be a good match. Write down the steps you may need to take to get from point A (the present) to point B (the goal).


Learn to organize your thoughts into clear, doable actions.
See your five-year plan as a series of small steps and goals. Break down how long you think it might take to complete each step.
For example, if you want to be head chef at a restaurant in five years, find out if you need to go to a culinary school or if you can simply start as a dishwasher and learn skills on the job as you move up. Find out what it take to go from being a line cook to a head chef. Think about if you want to start your own business, and how to get training in this.

, Don't feel like you have to have your life planned out and that you can't waver from those plans. Things may change unexpectedly — you may find that you're not that interested in being a doctor after shadowing at a hospital, or you might decide that you want to focus on travel more than a career. As you change and grow, so will your interests and priorities. Be flexible enough to realize that's ok and to accommodate those changes.


It's okay if you don't have everything figured out. Just try to identify a starting point and go from there.

, Find someone who can be a mentor. Life isn’t easy, and sometimes your parents may not be the best mentors. Look to people in your school like a teacher or guidance counselor. Think about neighbors, church members, or other people in the community that have been looking out for you.


Be honest with them about what you’re thinking and feeling. No one succeeds alone. Getting your life started will feel a lot less overwhelming when you reach out and talk with someone you trust.

, Don’t waste your time with people who put you down, pressure you, or make you feel worthless. You are a unique person, and with some effort, you can find your path.Identify people in your life that are positive and caring. Spend more time with them.
Learn the difference between people who annoy or hurt you versus people who may come across as negative because they are telling you to be cautious. Not all criticism is bad, so think before you discredit someone's point.
Trust your own judgment if negativity seems to dominate a conversation. Some people may want you to fail because it makes their life easier, or because they are struggling and want things to be difficult for other people, too. Be strong and be positive.

, Reach out to your community for advice and help. Your friends and family are not the only people that have advice. There are lots of people who may help you see different opportunities or perspectives that you never thought possible. Consider connecting with:


A guidance counselor, or other school staff that you trust
Your local library. Librarians can help find subjects that interest you about starting out, and learning how to be independent.
A neighborhood community center such as a YMCA, or an arts or fitness center
Leadership groups for teens through your school, or a non-profit center for youth
A group through your local church or place of worship
Your local community college for technical school opportunities or training

, When you’re frustrated with your parents, school, or the people you’re around, it feels like you just want to escape. Take a minute and take a deep breath. Before you start planning a life beyond the one you have now, think about what’s really motivating you.Is this a short-term problem? Are you thinking about leaving because of a recent set-back like failing a class, or an argument with your family?
Think about ways you can overcome this problem, so that it’s not so overwhelming that you just want out.

, Find someone in your life — your mom, dad, sibling, aunt, grandmother, cousin, or whoever you trust. Talk with them about how you want to get your life started, and what support they can offer. It’s not just about money, but it’s about what advice they may have.


Older generations may be able to give some honest answers about the good and bad of being independent, and what directions to take. You may be surprised to learn what older family members have been through or overcome, and they probably have a lot of solid, hard-won advice.
Let your negative feelings about certain family members go, and focus your time on the positive people in your life.

, There are lots of pressures you may be feeling as a teen—fitting in, difficult relationships, bullying, coping with stress, and family conflict. These can lead to depression and anxiety at times. Reaching out for help is a sign of strength rather than weakness. Consider these resources for support:


Find local resources in your area through your school, work, or community centers. Talk with a guidance counselor or mental health professional. Counseling centers may be available in your community for low or no cost.
If you’re a teen who’s going through a problem and you just want to talk to another teen, contact the Teen Line for support in the evenings (1-800-852-8336): https://teenlineonline.org/

If you are having thoughts of suicide or intense anxiety, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline 24/7 (1-800-273-8255): http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/

If you are thinking about running away from home, consider local resources in your area for support. Reach out to the National Runaway Safeline 24/7 (1-800-RUNAWAY): http://www.1800runaway.org/


, Your body is your temple. It’s like a sacred thing that you should cherish, because it’s the only one you have. Avoid things that harm your body, and make healthy living a priority. In the long run, you’ll thank yourself. Consider these ways to motivate your mind, body and spirit:Make healthy food choices. Drink water rather than soda. Eat healthy meals over fast food.

Exercise. Get off the couch, and get active. Go for a walk or a bike ride. Get out into nature. Exercise supports both physical and mental health.

Relieve stress through music, writing, art, sports, or even just taking a deep breath and counting to 10. Get a good night’s sleep.
Be kind to yourself. Don’t let yourself feel down too often. Get help when you’re angry, sad, or anxious. You’re not alone.

, Being willing to help, even if it’s hard, stressful, or physically demanding, is one of the key parts to success versus failure. In life, no one can succeed in school, work, or life without the motivation to do things that are tough. Stay strong, and keep going.


Reliability is one of the keys to getting and keeping a job."

Take interest in your success.",How to Get Your Life Back on Track2," The good thing about having family, friends, and colleagues is that they expect you to show up for holidays, social outings, and meetings. You become part of the “family” or the “team” and your absence will have a negative impact. Therefore, having expectations placed upon you like this will keep you focused on your goal of getting your life straightened out and focused on the things that matter the most.You do not have to necessarily be a part of a team. Make friends doing the activities you enjoy. For example, if you like to work out make some friends at the gym to exercise with. After a while, they will expect you to show up so you can work out together.
Think about it this way: a team needs all members to participate in some way to achieve success. Being a part of a successful team will motivate and reward you for your part. Don’t live your life in a vacuum, meet expectations and stay focused on your goals.

, Most people like to think about the things they want or wish they had. The next step – making excuses why you don’t have those things – is a deflated way of thinking that could lead to depression or disinterest and, therefore, taking your focus away from keeping your life on track.

Spending time thinking about the reasons for why things are withheld from you is a major factor in pushing focus and goals off the track. Instead of thinking “I don’t have enough time,” “I don’t have enough money,” or “I don’t have enough experience” stay focused on the possible and remain positive.
Remember that most successful people start in the same exact place that you are in: no money, no time, and no experience. Just like them, set reasonable and achievable goals, building confidence and experience along the way. Say, “I can do this” as part of your motivation.
Making progress, no matter the time, money, or resources, is always better than lying around thinking about what you can’t do. Do what you can do and you feel the power of progress.

, We all like to think of the bigger picture of how things will turn out in the end, but overlooking details will make expectations harder to achieve. Looking only at the optimal picture, important details will be missing and the conclusions you jump to will lack important patterns and relationships. Therefore, you are more likely not to be able to distinguish relationships between ideas that are critical to a complete understanding of what the bigger picture entails.Strive for balance so that you do not get overwhelmed and abandon your goals. It’s okay to visualize the optimal picture, but realize that it is all the little details that will make accomplishing your goal special.
It might be a good idea to write down the process or steps that you need to take to achieve your dream. Then, think about all of the things you need to do under each of the steps to complete it and move forward. An outline, brainstorm web, or map will help keep things organized.
Evaluate each step you take and summarize the results.

, Motivation, inspiration, and willpower – These general desires come and go and rarely can be maintained in the long-term. Rather than rely on them, create an environment for you to succeed. This includes people, places, and events that influence your behavior.

Your environment can trigger a wide-range of responses. The pictures on the wall, the desk you work at, the coffee shop you go to, and the people you see all influence the actions you take. Make sure to notice these influences and change the scenery for an optimal environment.
Environment impacts mood as well. Choose an environment that is comfortable, well-lit, fresh air, and has happy people.
Environmental change can also relate to behavior. If you have a habit of forgetting, you can make changes to the environment to be more successful in daily life. For example, a simple change such as placing your journal beside your house keys to remind you to make an entry before leaving the house will take one more responsibility off of your mind and lessen stress.

, Make sure the route you take is sincere and will help you get your life back on track. Don’t get caught up in chasing things you really are not interested in because if you fail to achieve your pursuit, it could lead to negative feelings of being a loser or failure. Care about what you are doing and your chances of success will be much greater.If you have trouble achieving all of your goals try to focus on successfully mastering one at a time. If you really care about that goal or habit, you will work hard to make it successful. If not, then maybe it is not as important as you thought.
Keeping your life on track is difficult. Therefore, anticipate setbacks, missteps, and complications, but don’t give up. Develop a well thought out plan that will successfully put you back in the place you want to be in.

Confront your fears.,
Reset your life.,
Commit to new priorities.,
Evaluate your choices.",How to Get Your Life Back on Track3," One easy way to get off track is by living in fear. A decision, on your part, has to be made to emerge from the fear of the future. Nobody knows the future so don’t let it be a barrier to a successful future. Hold yourself accountable by being consistent, dependable, and innovative.Action can build your courage. Embrace your fears so that you can move past them and open your world to new possibilities of realizing who you really are.
Positive thinking breeds success. Instead of always anticipating the worst train yourself to always expect the best out of all that you do.
Lean on your family and friends for support. They tend to see your strengths whenever you have forgotten them and are often full of praise and encouragement.

, Repeating failure will result in repeating failure. Break the cycle by resetting your life for success. The important step in resetting your life is to put everything in its proper place so that you can excel in all areas of your life. In other words, live your daily life so that it collides with your dreams and aspirations.Breaking the cycle of failure is not easy. At some point, you will have to interrupt the way you think, act, or feel to reset your life. All three are interconnected but concentrating on changing one link can lead to changes in the other two links.
Interrupt your thinking by improving the answers to your problems. These ideas cannot originate in thin air so take time to read books and articles, ask a professional or colleague, or brainstorm with friends for new ideas.
Interrupt your feeling by channeling your emotions to receive positive thinking that produces the results that you want. For example, keep a journal, review your goals regularly, surround yourself with positive people and ideas, and change your physiology to trigger a positive set of feelings.
Interrupt your actions by changing what you are currently doing. You might have to experiment first to decide what actions to focus on but, generally, start working on new ideas as soon as you can, modify your habits, stop performing negative actions, and try to experience as much as you can to see what does and doesn’t work.

, Be aware of old habits, they are hard to break. Make a new commitment that holds you responsible and accountable for engaging in new priorities. A commitment is more than just changing your actions, you must also change your attitude.Take fifteen minutes a day and think about what makes you feel rejuvenated, relaxed, and happy and keep a list so that you can continue to concentrate on those feelings.
Learn to say no to things that don’t interest you or harm your well-being. If you need help in doing this, then seek out a friend or family member to aid you.
Create a daily ritual like taking a walk, listening to peaceful music, or sitting out in a park to give yourself time to evaluate your day and to remind yourself of your new priorities.

, Remember decisions greatly impact your life. Nothing in your life will change until you take time to evaluate the lifestyle choices you have made. Making poor choices is one of the most frequent reasons why people get off track. Your choices must line up with your goals otherwise you will suffer from the powerless cycle of indecision and deviate from the positive changes you want to make in your life.Begin the process of getting your life back on track by making quality decisions. Once you decide to make change, you must make a commitment to those decisions to reach your goals.

Recognize your symptoms.,
Talk to somebody you trust.,
Create a positive environment.,
Resume normal activity.,
Get the proper nutrition and exercise.,
Seek professional help.,
Focus on your future.",How to Get Your Life Back on Track4," Realize that trauma is caused by abnormal circumstances, such as job loss, divorce, or a humiliating experience. Although the experience may make you feel like you are out of control, recognizing the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome will help you recover much quicker by finding the help you need.Trauma has both physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms consist of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, edginess and agitation, and muscle tension while emotional symptoms are shock, denial, guilt, sadness, irritability, and anxiety.
Symptoms can last from just a few days or a couple of months. Although you may feel better as time moves forward, you could still be troubled from time to time by agonizing memories triggered by the anniversary of the event or by an image, person, or sound that reminds of you of the experience.
Grieving is a normal emotion following trauma. The natural reaction to trauma is grief. Although grieving is painful, it allows you talk about how you feel and makes it easier to get support from others. Don’t try to withhold the grieving process, it is important for recovery.

, After a traumatic experience, it is a good idea to talk to family, friends, or colleagues about your thoughts, feelings, and reactions to what happened to you. There is no set length of time for how long you will need to talk about it. In other words, keep talking until you are ready to stop.

The people you surround yourself with are very important at this point. Try to associate with positive people in an uplifting environment. Emotions are contagious and you will need to be around people with a lot of positive energy.
Turn to family, friends, and colleagues who will stand behind and encourage you. They can provide emotional support until an opportunity comes along to help you recover.

, A feeling of safety and tranquility in your immediate environment will help you to relax your mind and calm your symptoms. Avoid getting yourself into situations that are disorganized, chaotic, or full of discord. Instead, seek out harmony and peace to help get yourself back on track.

Buy fresh flowers and place them throughout your house.
Light non-fragrant candles to give a feeling of calm and relaxation.
Open the blinds and let the natural sunshine in. Sun provides warmth and happiness.
Play soothing music and read a relaxing book.
Remove clutter because it appears distracting and feels chaotic and disordered.

, Take time to recover but do not be a recluse forever. Resume your normal activities and routines as quickly as you can. Traumatic events throw you into chaos, routines bring stability and structure brings security. Get your life back on track!People who have traumatic experiences often feel that extra time off to relax is what they need to recover. It is, however, critical to get back on your feet as soon as possible. In other words, days turn into weeks and weeks into months. This is valuable time off that could be spent getting your life back on track.
Try to participate in social activities, even if you don’t feel like it. Being around other people and doing relatively normal things will help you integrate back into society.

, Mental and emotional resilience demands the proper nutrition and exercise. Focus on taking care of yourself and do whatever it takes to feel healthy and fit. According to research, exercise builds resilience against stress. Turn negative feelings and emotions into positive ones through proper nutrition and exercise.Regular exercise will release serotonin (contributes to wellbeing and happiness), endorphins (reduces pain), and dopamine (controls rewards and pleasures in the brain). Exercise also increases self-esteem and improves sleep patterns. Try to get at least thirty minutes of exercise every day.
Eating a well-balanced diet will keep your energy levels up, minimize mood swings, and keep you mentally and physically fit. Try sticking with foods rich in omega-3 fats such as fish, walnuts, and soybeans to keep your mood positive.
As a part of your daily exercise routine, make time for relaxation techniques found in stretching, yoga, and mediation to bring your life back into balance and reduce stress.

, If you cannot stop thinking about your trauma or it begins to overtake your life or your happiness, it is time to seek out a psychotherapist. Recovery takes time, but if you are still experiencing symptoms from your traumatic experience months or years later, then you need to find a trauma expert.If you are having difficulty functioning at home or work, suffering from severe anxiety or depression, experiencing flashbacks, avoiding friends and family, or using drugs or alcohol to cope with your problems, it is time to seek out professional help.
Choose a psychotherapist that you feel comfortable with and who has experience dealing with trauma. After all, dealing with trauma is a scary and painful experience that could be relived or re-traumatizing  at any time. Make sure you feel respected and understood by your therapist.
A professional therapist will concentrate on processing your feelings, discharging negative energy, teaching how to regulate strong emotions, and building trusting relationships as part of the recovery process.

, It’s easy to relive the past and think about all the things you wished you could have changed, but there is nothing you can do to change the past. Naturally, you will think about your traumatic experience, get angry with others, wonder what went wrong. Instead, think positively about what the future holds for you.

Talk to a trusted adult.",How to Tell if You Have Started Puberty (for Girls)," When you hit puberty you'll start to gain weight and height. Often your limbs grow first, so that you can seem awkward and clumsy (don't worry, this won't last forever).Most girls gain weight during puberty. You might notice more fat along the upper arms, thighs, and upper back. Typically your hips will get rounder and wider, while your waist gets narrower. Of course, this develops differently in different girls. Some girls will be bigger than others. Some girls will be shorter than others.
Girls tend to grow fastest about six months before their first period. This is why girls tend to be bigger than boys during puberty.
You'll also find that hair will start growing in your armpits and that the hair on your legs gets coarser and more profuse.;
, Having your breasts develop is a very obvious sign that you're undergoing puberty. It's important to remember, however, that some girls develop early, some develop late, and some are flat-chested throughout their lives. It all depends on your genetics.Typically you'll have small, firm, tender lumps (called buds) under one or both nipples when your breasts first start to grow. Over the next two years or so you'll find that your breasts will get larger and become less firm in texture.
If you feel uncomfortable about your breasts, or they are painful, you might try out a training bra to see if that will help you manage them. However, remember that your breasts can often feel painful right before the start of your period.

, Going through puberty means that your sexual organs grow and change. This can be a little unnerving if you don't know what to expect. However, it's nothing to be alarmed about!Your clitoris will grow larger. The clitoris is typically a sensitive, pea-sized nodule of tissue above the entrance to your vagina.
Hair will grow between your legs in your pubic area, this hair will be coarser and curly than hair on your head and may be darker. This is called pubic hair. You'll also find hair appears on your labia major, the larger of the two pairs of folds of skin that surround your vagina. The smaller pair of folds of skin are called the labia minor, not every woman has hair on their inner labia (inner labia is another term labia minor).

, Your period is one of the biggest signs that you've hit puberty. It can be unnerving in the beginning, because you aren't used to it. Fortunately, there are signs to watch for so you know that it's coming, and ways to deal with it when it does show up!Typically your period will show up between the ages of 10 and 16. It depends on the girl, because some start as early as 8, while others might get it after 16. If you're concerned that it hasn't come, or that it's coming too soon, make sure to talk to your doctor.
Your period will usually make it's first appearance soon after you've developed your breasts (although, again, it depends on the girl). It can take a while before your period gets regular while your body adjusts to this new aspect of life.
Some symptoms of your period include: aching in your upper thighs, back pain, bloating, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, sore breasts. You also might notice some excretions in your underwear before your period starts (usually whitish or clear). You can take any over-the-counter pain medication for the cramping and pain.
There are different products you can use to manage your bleeding. If you decide to use tampons, make sure you get the ones that are designed for teenagers and younger girls as these will be easier to use. You may need to use a pad, as well especially at night when the menstrual flow can be heavier. You can also try using a menstrual cup; these cost less in the long run and they are reusable (unlike tampons and pads).
If you happen to have your period at school, you don't need to worry. Usually before your period, there will be signs that your period is coming, such as pains in your lower back. Before your period, pack a bag with panty liners, pads, and an extra pair of underwear.

, When puberty starts happening your body gets more sensitive to the hormone testosterone (girls have it as well as boys!). This hormone makes the glands in your skin produce too much oil. With dead skin blocking the little tubes where your hair grows through, the oil builds up to develop a white head or black head.Sometimes bacteria can infect a blocked hair follicle, because the hormones change the levels of acid in your skin. This infection can create a spot or pustule.
Make sure that you keep your skin clean to prevent the build-up of oil. Wash twice a day with a mild cleanser. Avoid scrubbing hard at your face, because this will irritate your skin. Use a moisturizer if your skin is dry (you'll need a non-comedogenic moisturizer so that it won't cause spots).
Keeping your face clean won't always prevent new spots from showing up, so it's good to get some cream or lotion that is designed to prevent or treat acne. You can get some over-the-counter at any drugstore or pharmacy. Make sure to look for a cream that is designed for your skin type (oily, dry, sensitive, etc.).
If you're having really bad acne, you should talk to your doctor. Treatments can take up to three months to start being effective, so make sure that you keep using whatever they've prescribed until you see signs that it's making a difference.

, When you start puberty, your body begins to develop large sweat glands in your armpits, your breasts, and your genitals. These glands (called apocrine glands) release sweat when you're stressed, when you're highly emotional, or when you're sexually excited.It's the apocrine glands that create body odor, so you'll need to keep those areas (armpits, breasts, genitals) clean, by washing with soap. This keeps bacteria from building up.
Change and wash your clothes regularly, especially the clothes that come into contact with the apocrine glands. These would be things like bra, shirts, and underwear.
Using an antiperspirant or deodorant each day can help mask or cut down on body odor. Antiperspirants reduce the amount of sweat your body produces. Deodorants use perfume to mask your body odor.
Shaving your armpits can also cut down on body odor. Armpit hair traps sweat and odor, which causes bacteria to multiply and create more body odor.

, Because puberty is the time when you're maturing physically, emotionally, and sexually you might find yourself noticing other people in new and exciting ways. This is perfectly normal.This is a time when you'll start exploring your sexuality and your sexual feelings about other people. Everyone ends up having a sexual identity (basically who you are interested in). You could find that you're interested in girls (lesbian), or boys (heterosexual), or both (bisexual), or that you aren't interested sex at all ever (asexual). This could change as you get older, or it could stay the same.There are lots of taboos associated with masturbation, but there is nothing biologically wrong with masturbating (you won't grow hair on your hands, become infertile, or go blind). It's natural to feel curiosity about your sexual organs and about other people's sexual organs and masturbation is one way to learn to be comfortable with your body and your sexuality.
It's good to keep in mind that you don't need to act on every sexual feeling that you have, especially if you're just starting out. If you do act on your feelings, make sure that you understand about consent and protection (see the third section).

, Hormones are the things that are making all the changes in your body and mental growth. Hormones also cause the wild mood swings and emotional turbulence that accompanies puberty.


Your hormones go to your ovaries (which are the two oval-shape organs to the right and left of your uterus). They trigger the growth and release of the eggs in your ovaries and the production the hormone called estrogen.
Estrogen matures your body and helps to prepare you for pregnancy (whether or not you ever decide to have children).

, Hitting puberty (and the following years) can be difficult, because of the hormones that are changing your body and your mind. This can lead to mood swings, low self-esteem, and anxiety. This is all perfectly normal (although you should keep an eye out for the parts that aren't typical).Some of the mood swings you might experience are low self-esteem, aggression (feeling angry, often for no reason), depression, feeling happy one moment and angry or upset the next. The best thing you can do is acknowledge how you're feeling and find a quiet place to decompress, especially if you're feeling angry.
PMS (premenstrual syndrome) is often a big cause of your wildly fluctuating moods. This is because of the surge of hormones. You might have difficulty sleeping, feelings of irritability, anxiety, and cravings for certain foods (often sugar). Keeping track of your menstrual cycle can allow you to feel a little more sane during PMS, because you'll know that it's just your hormones.
Sometimes puberty can trigger real problems with your mood or your mental processes. If your mood seems out of control, or your depression or anxiety has taken over the rest of your life, you may need to seek therapy. There's nothing wrong with needing therapy, remember. Lots of people need help coping with mental disorders.

, One thing you might find is that you're having problems with your parents. This is because as you go through your teenage years you're looking for independence and finding out who you are separate from your parents.


It's good to talk things out with your parents if you're feeling like they're stifling you. For example, if you're getting older you might talk with your parents about extending your curfew, or letting you go do things by yourself. If you can present your case by showing how you won't abuse the changes that you're asking for, you might find your parents dealing with your search for independence more easily.
Ask yourself why your parents are acting in certain ways that might be irritating to you. Have you recently betrayed their trust by doing something you weren't supposed to (staying out late to go to a party, or not doing your homework, for example)? Have you been hanging out with people who have been encouraging inappropriate, or unhealthy behaviors?

, Also, don't panic if it doesn't follow exactly like you think it should. Sometimes women's breasts don't come in until way after their period has shown up, sometimes they never do. It's all okay. If you do think there's a problem, make sure that you talk to a doctor about it.


Sometimes puberty comes really early. This can be difficult because suddenly you're taller than everyone else, you have breasts, and you've already gotten your period. If you're an early-bloomer, talk to an adult lady that you trust about your feelings and the changes you're going through.
On the other hand, sometimes you'll start puberty later than everyone else. This can be difficult, because you feel like you're missing out on something or that no one will find you attractive! Don't worry about that. If you think there's a problem, talk to a doctor, but otherwise know that puberty will happen eventually.

, Because you're starting to feel sexual feelings, puberty is a good time to educate yourself about being safe sexually. This doesn't mean that you should start sleeping with everyone you have the hots for, but it does mean that when you are ready to have sex, you are prepared for it.Consent is something that should be taught in schools, but isn't. Never pressure someone into having sex with you, never force them if they aren't interested. Unless you get an enthusiastic and non-coerced ""yes"" you shouldn't be having sex with that person. The same goes for you, however. Unless you give an enthusiastic and non-coerced ""yes"" they should not try to have sex with you. If someone has sex with you without you giving an absolute ""yes"" that can be considered sexual assault (even if it happens while you're both drunk).
Make sure that you're being honest about your sexual habits. If you have to lie to friends and family about being sexually active, it's probably best to wait until you're able to be honest. It's also best to be honest about your feelings (or lack thereof) for someone, so that no one (including you) feels like they've been led on. If someone can't take a hint, that's their problem, not yours.
Make sure that you're educated about the forms of birth control (like pills, IUDs, morning after pills, condoms). It's a good idea to use condoms when you're having sex regardless of whether you're on birth control, to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Birth control can also be used to help lighten your period (if you have a difficult one), and control certain health issues.

, Puberty can be a confusing time, so it helps to talk to someone who has already experienced it. A trusted adult can answer your questions, and help you cope with the changes that you'll experience. You can talk to someone like your mom, or an older sister, or a female relative (they don't have to be related to you).


A doctor can be a good person to talk to, especially if you're having things happen that don't seem normal. They can lay to rest any fears you have, or help assess you and see if something is actually wrong.
You might need to see a counselor or therapist if you're having a particularly difficult time with puberty (possibly with depression or anxiety). A lot of good therapists can help you with issues relating to your sexuality, to your mood swings, even with your physical changes.
There are lots of help-lines for issues dealing with depression, anxiety, sexual identity. You can also find good websites to help you deal with the changes you're undergoing, and where you can talk with other people who are experiencing the same things.

Go to the doctor for a testosterone test.,
Be prepared for additional tests.,
Get an oral test.,
The most common test is for “total testosterone,” which is the testosterone that is bound to other proteins in the blood.,
Consider what affects the test.,
Choose a testosterone replacement therapy.",How to Test Testosterone Levels1," The most common test for testosterone involves your physician drawing a tube of blood from your vein. In addition to the blood sample, your physician will also perform a physical exam., Because low testosterone may be an indicator for an underlying problem, like a problem with the pituitary gland, liver disease, an inherited disease, or Addison's disease, your doctor may want to test you for an underlying problem if you have low testosterone. Depending on your physical exam, your symptoms, and your history, other tests may be required after the testosterone test. Your doctor may test for thyroid function, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease., Testosterone can also be measured in your saliva, though not many mainstream physicians offer this option. The test is reasonably reliable, but it is too new of a method to be totally accepted.Two reputable labs that test for salivary testosterone are ZRTLabs and Labrix.

, If your total testosterone from your screening lab test comes back abnormal, ask to have the test for “free” or bioavailable testosterone. The most important testosterone value is the “free” and/or bioavailable testosterone. This is not always measured because it is not so easy to measure.


The tests for “free” or bioavailable testosterone are considered better biomarkers., There are things that might affect the results of your test. Taking medicines with estrogen or testosterone (including birth control), digoxin, spironolactone, and barbiturates may interfere with the test. Medicines for prostate cancer and that raise prolactin levels may also have a negative effect. Hypothyroidism can also interfere with the test., If your testosterone levels are low, talk to your physician about testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone is available as a gel or patch, muscular injections, or tablets that can be dissolved under the tongue.There are also some natural options including dietary approaches, increased exercise, and herbs such as Tribulus terrestris, Ashwagandha, Ginkgo Biloba, Maca, and Yohimbe.

Brush your teeth.",How to Use Good Feminine Hygiene (for Teens)," Find a shampoo that works well for your hair. Brush it every morning when you wake up and every night before you go to bed. Don't straighten or curl it every day without using some sort of heat treatment.;
, Find a good cleanser to wash your face with. Every morning and night, spend four minutes massaging your face with it. Get around your nose and right up to the hairline of your forehead. Rinse your face with warm water, then with cold water to close your now-clean pores. Pat your face, and apply pimple cream as needed. Always moisturize after to keep your skin soft and smooth!

, Everyday, file your nails so they don't get scraggly. Clean them once a week with a nail scrubber. As needed, clip them. If you want to, you may polish your nails or go to a nail salon. This goes for toenails, too!

, Instead of filling up on junk food, eat fruits and vegetables. Eat three square meals a day, with some healthy snacks in between. Never skip breakfast! Skipping the most important meal of the day results in a slower metabolism, which causes faster weight gain. Try to make your meal last at least 20 minutes. Eating slower tells you when you're full and need to stop. Try to not eat when watching TV, unless it's healthy. Bring a bottle of water everywhere with you. It keeps you hydrated and flushes toxins out of your body.

, Try to get 60 minutes of physical exercise per day. Switch it up! Don't do the same boring routine each day. Your body will get tired of it and you won't be doing anything but being bored. So try jumping rope one day and swimming the next.

, Don't just stand under the water! Lather your body with a body wash. Wash your hair once every other day with a shampoo that's designed for your type of hair. Keep the conditioner in for a while. If you need to shave, spread a layer of shaving cream or body wash on the desired area and shave gently and slowly. Don't use soap to shave, because it dries out your skin. Apply lotion after you get out.


Don't shave your under arms everyday. This can cause redness and irritation, and be very uncomfortable. Shave every 2-3 days to avoid this.







, Brushing your teeth is important for good dental health. Skipping out on brushing could leave you with smelly breath, and maybe yellow teeth, and eventually lead to dental problems. Brush two times a day for two minutes each. Also, use a tongue scraper to get rid of bad breath and to keep your tongue clean. And don't forget about the mouthwash and floss!

, Hairs, hairs everywhere... One of puberty's clearest indicators is when you start getting hairs in unexpected places. For boys, it is likely to include facial hair, underarm hair, more hair on the legs and chest, and pubic hair. Girls are likely to spot hair growth on the underarms and in the pubic area.

, Your breasts may be tender and may hurt. Please tell a trusted adult about this so you can buy a supportive bra if needed for better support.

, For girls, the best sign of the onset of puberty is the first period. It is likely to be irregular at first, but your periods will settle into a more regular pattern. This shows almost certainty that you are going through puberty.


Before you start getting periods, you may start seeing vaginal discharge, which is a substance that's usually white or slightly yellow in color. These often start happening some time before your first period, but some girls don't get them until after they've started their periods.

, Acne is a common adolescence symptom which is caused by increased secretion of oils and grease in the pores, and bacteria infecting them. If you've got acne, you're almost certainly going through puberty.

, You may suddenly feel all self-conscious. Everybody seems to be looking at you, and you don't like standing up in front of a large number of people any more. If you're finding you suddenly have these sorts of problems, you're probably starting puberty.

, You find that you start to have feelings of attraction for other people, and you may start to be interested in romance, dating, and sexual activity (at least in theory, even if it's too early in practice). If this sounds like you, you've probably started puberty.

, You may find that it took you a year to manage a couple of inches before, you're gaining inches in height faster than you can count them! If this is you, and you're 10-13, you've probably started puberty. If your appetite suddenly takes a leap like it's never leapt before, that's a sign of puberty, too.

, If you find that you get unbelievably happy, and intensely angry, and grief stricken and you don't really know why, you've probably got hormone rushes, which are a symptom of puberty. Boys especially can get very angry and not understand why.

, It may sound gross, and it's true - the smell is hardly appealing. If you find you get stronger-smelling sweat and more of it, even when you're not actually hot, you've probably started puberty.

, If you see any or all of these signs in you, it's time to talk to mom and dad. It may seem hard at first, but in puberty, communication is the key to avoid going off the rails. Parents have been there before, so they'll be able to help you out!

See if you have more body odor.,
Check for an increase in the sizes of your testicles.,
Check for an increase in the size of your penis and scrotum.,
Check for body hair growth.,
Check for a swelling in your chest.,
Check for mild to moderate acne.,
See if you're having more erections.,
See if you're having wet dreams.,
Check for a growth spurt.,
Check the shape of your face.,
Check to see if your voice has started cracking.",How to Tell if You Have Hit Puberty (Boys)1," Your hormones affect your sweat glands, which can lead you to smell a bit more and to smell differently. If you have a change in your body odor, then it may be time to start wearing deodorant if you aren't doing so already. You may also need to shower more often to keep your body feeling and smelling clean., If the size of your testicles is increasing, then you've probably hit puberty. This is one of the first signs of puberty and isn't always easy to spot. Your testicles will continue to grow from childhood to puberty to adulthood., About a year after your testicles begin to increase in size, your penis and scrotum will start to grow as well. Your penis will increase in length, and will grow less significantly in width. Your testicles will continue to grow from childhood to puberty to adulthood., Once your testicles have begun to grow, you may notice that you're growing body hair in places that previously had very thin hair, little hair, or no hair at all. These locations include your armpits, pubic region, arms, legs, chest, face, hands, and feet. Your hair will not only grow in new places, but it may become thick and darker as well. Usually, you'll grow facial and underarm hair about two years after you grow pubic hair. Every boy's body is different. Some boys will develop thick body hair during puberty, while others won't see a major change in their amount of body hair. Some people are just naturally hairier than others.
The hair in your pubic region and armpits may get even darker than the rest of your body hair, as well as coarser and more curly.

, Some boys develop a swelling in their chests for 1-2 years. This is perfectly natural and does not mean you're developing breasts. It just means that your body is adjusting to its new form. This typically happens when you're around 13-14 years old and does not affect everyone., Acne may be unpleasant, but it's a perfectly natural part of puberty. The high levels of hormones in your body can cause acne outbreaks in parts of your body that had previously never seen a single pimple. Part of the reason is also that your oil glands will be more active during puberty, which will cause you to sweat more and will make your skin more prone to acne. Most boys develop acne about at the same time as when they develop underarm hair. As your skin grows more oily, you'll find that you may need to shower more to continue to look and feel clean.
Some boys develop severe acne during puberty. If this is a concern for you, then you and your parents should see a doctor to discuss potentially taking medication.

, A boy or man has an erection when his penis hardens and lengthens. This can happen when a boy has romantic or sexual thoughts, or when his penis is stimulated. Erections can also happen without any stimulation or romantic thoughts at all, which can be a bit embarrassing if you're in public.Though you can have erections before puberty, you'll find that you get erections more often during puberty as your sexual feelings and hormones develop.
Most erections aren't completely straight -- they tend to curve upwards or to one side.

, During a wet dream, a boy becomes sexually aroused during his sleep and ejaculates semen. Semen is the sticky liquid that contains sperm. Sometimes, when you have a wet dream, you can remember having a sexual dream, but many times you may just notice a wet patch on your pajamas, underwear, or sheets when you wake up.If you've found that you did have a wet dream, then you should wash your penis and the soiled clothes or linens.
Don't worry if you've never had a wet dream but have experienced other signs of puberty -- not everyone gets them.

, Every boy grows at a different time, and you may find that you're suddenly a head taller than all of your friends, or that you haven't grown very much while all of your friends are suddenly hovering over you. But don't worry -- either your friends will catch up, or you'll catch up to them. It may just take more time. Here are some more things to consider when you're checking for a growth spurt:Typically, boys will have their growth spurts a bit later than girls. You may come back to school after a long summer and find that all of the girls in your class are suddenly taller than you. That's perfectly normal.
Look to see if your fingers are growing, and check to see if your feet are growing. For example, if you shoot up three shoe sizes in about three months, you are probably having a growth spurt.
Most boys reach the peak of their growth spurts about half a year after they develop pubic hair. You'll find yourself growing taller -- sometimes dramatically taller.
Your shoulders may also become broader and more full to reach your new frame.
If you feel like you've had a growth spurt but wish you were a bit taller, don't worry. Most boys don't reach their adult heights until their late teens or early 20s, so you will have time to grow.

, Before puberty, your face may be more round and apple-cheeked, kind of like Charlie Brown's. During puberty, your face will become more oval-shaped and will look more defined and adult-like. It may be difficult to study a change in your face since you're used to looking at it all the time. Check out photos of yourself from a year ago, or even a few months ago, and see if you can detect a difference.

, You may have found that your voice has been cracking a lot lately, which will sound like a nervous creaking sound that can stop you cold in the middle of a sentence. This may be a bit embarrassing in public, but have no fear -- most boys experience a cracking voice, and it's just a sign that you're on your way to becoming a man. Your voice will stop cracking after a few months and will become deeper.Your voice is changing because of an increase in testosterone, male hormone, in your body. This makes your vocal chords thicker and louder, which allows them to produce a deeper sound.
This change in hormones also makes your larynx grow bigger. You can see this change in a protrusion of cartilage in your neck, which is also known as the ""Adam's apple.""
You may also find that you have more trouble controlling your voice, as its sound goes up and down instead of sounding nice and even.
Typically, your voice will start cracking around the same time as when your penis beings to grow.

See if you're starting to feel more attracted to other people.,
See if you're having mood swings.,
See if you're feeling things more intensely.,
See if you're experiencing more anxiety.,
See if you're feeling more withdrawn from your parents.,
See if you're feeling unfamiliar emotions.,
See if you care more about your appearance.",How to Tell if You Have Hit Puberty (Boys)2," If you haven't shown much of an interest in girls or other boys before, but are suddenly interested in, or even fascinated by them, then you may be going through one major emotional change of puberty. If you're finding yourself feeling more attracted or even aroused by girls or other boys who were previously uninteresting to you, then this is a sign of your developing body.


Every boy is different. You might have been crushing on girls for years before you hit puberty, or you may be in the throes of puberty without feeling much interest in the opposite gender. This will come to you.
Of course, if you're gay or bisexual, then your feelings of attraction and arousal may be directed toward other boys or men.

, Were you previously pretty even-keeled, or would some people even have described you as ""chill""? Well, all of that can go out the window when you hit puberty. Your raging hormones may make it more difficult for you to control your emotions, and you can go from feeling completely happy, indifferent, or intensely angry to having a completely different emotion just a few minutes later.


If you find yourself suddenly feeling incredibly elated out of the blue, you may be experiencing a positive mood swing.
If you were feeling fine and suddenly snap at someone or even feel like you're boiling with rage, then you may be experiencing a negative mood swing.

, Before, you might have thought that everything was ""fine,"" ""okay,"" or, at most, ""pretty cool."" But now, every great experience you have, whether it's hanging out with friends or eating an amazing slice of pizza, may feel like the greatest thing that ever happened to you. On the other hand, any sad experience, however minor, may make you feel intensely upset, or even ""totally depressed.""


This new intensity of feeling is another sign that your body is adjusting to new levels of hormones.

, Anxiety is that jittery feeling that can bubble up in your chest, stomach, hands, and almost any part of your body when you're nervous or worried about something. You may find yourself feeling anxious about things that didn't matter to you so much before, whether it's how you do on your latest Algebra test, how you'll perform in that night's baseball game, or what the girls in your class will think of your new haircut.


Anxiety can feel uncomfortable, but it's a sign that you really care about something. Everything may take on a new and more intense meaning when you're going through puberty.

, While you might have loved hanging out at home all weekend or going out to eat with your parents previously, you may feel yourself withdrawing from your home environment. During puberty, you may want to feel more control over your life and actions because you're feeling like you have less control over your body. It's only natural that you'd want to spend less time with your parents, most likely a controlling force in your life. Here are some signs that you may be withdrawing from your parents:


If you used to leave your door open and let your parents walk in any time, but now you have the urge to shut the door or even lock it.
If you generally feel a need for more privacy when you didn't care if your parents were nearby before.
If you're spending much more time hanging out with your friends or just out of the house.
If you spend more time talking to your friends online than you spend talking to your parents.
If you feel like you have less and less to say to your parents, aren't eager to tell them about your day, and don't want to hang out too long at the dinner table.

, This is a bit more vague, but it's an important step to finding out if you're having emotional changes from puberty. What's unfamiliar is different for everyone. Maybe you're feeling more anxious than normal, maybe you're feeling more giddy than normal, or maybe you're finding that you have more complicated feelings about your friends, parents, and members of the opposite gender.

, If you never used to care much about your looks, but are now thinking more and more about your hair, your clothes, and the appearance of your hair and body, then you're growing more self-conscious and becoming more aware of how you may be viewed by the opposite gender. This is perfectly natural and is a sign of your developing mind.

Talk to a trustworthy adult, such as a parent, teacher, or school counselor so that you can get help for your depression.To ask for help and start a conversation with one or both of your parents, you might start by saying something like, “I think I am depressed and I want to get some help. Can we talk about it?”
Explain how you have been feeling. For example, you might say, “I have been feeling sad most of the time, having trouble sleeping at night, and I have lost interest in things that I used to enjoy.”
If your parents are resistant to the idea of you seeing a therapist for depression, then try to explain why you think you need to see one. For example, you might say, “This has been going on for a while. It is affecting my grades, my personal life, and my well-being. I do not think that I can get better on my own.”
If your parents still do not want you to see a therapist, you should talk to someone at your school.

Join an organization, club, or team sport to be around people who share a common interest with you., Be conscious of the way you think about your life and yourself. Identify negative thought patterns and try to replace these thoughts with more constructive ones.

If the first adult that you talk with does not accept what you are saying, then you may need to talk with someone else. Keep telling people until someone listens to you. Think about an adult in your life that you know you can trust and who you feel comfortable with.

This technique will allow you to increase the oxygen in your body and can produce unusual sensations. Get ready and make sure you won't be distracted before using this technique.This technique is done most easily when sitting or laying down.
Make sure your phone is turned off or put away.
Create a space that will allow you to focus on this exercise.
Before you perform this technique you should consult your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough to do so.
You should not do this breathing exercise if you have certain medical conditions such as asthma.;
, In order to bring more oxygen into your body you will need to inhale properly. As you inhale make sure you are breathing in deeply, using your diaphragm to draw in a full and complete breath. Full inhalations are critical to this breathing technique.Use your solar plexus or diaphragm to draw in a full breath.
Your inhalation should take around only one second.
Try to pull in as much air as you can on your inhalation.

, Once you have taken a deep breath, inhaling using your diaphragm, you will need to exhale quickly and with some force. Make sure your lungs are mostly empty as you push all the air from them. Nearly emptying your lungs will allow you to quickly inhale once again, drawing and retaining oxygen..Tighten up your stomach on your exhalation to push air out of your lungs.
Your exhalation should last about one second.
Make your exhalations strong, pushing air out of your lungs.

You may see swirling colors or images.
If you feel dizzy or any pain stop immediately.

, After the final inhalation exhale fully and hold your breath.

As you hold your breath, examine your body and mind for any new sensations you might be feeling.Hold your breath until you naturally feel the impulse to breathe again.
Don't force the holding of your breath.
Inhale when you feel you need to do so, holding a full inhalation for 15 seconds before breathing normal again.

Take care of yourself.,
Identify and challenge unrealistic thoughts.,
Focus on your positive traits.,
Don’t allow your mood to dictate what you do.,
Do fun things.,
Use relaxation techniques to help you feel calm.",How to Get Over Depression as a Kid2," Dealing with depression can be really hard and can lead to physical issues in addition to the feelings you are having. Depression can also lead to negative, and sometimes suicidal, thoughts. Depression doesn't occur because of anything you did, it happens when chemicals in your brain are off balance. Make sure, during this time, you are taking care of yourself.


If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself or hurting others, tell an adult immediately. Your safety is the number one priority.Call emergency services (such as 911 in the US) or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).You can also talk to your school counselor about these thoughts.
Get enough sleep, about 8 hours, everyday.
Remind yourself to eat well. Depression can affect your appetite, so eat regularly throughout the day and try to make healthy eating choices.
Try to exercise 20 minutes a day, three days a week. Even if you don't feel like it, or even if the exercise is just a walk outside, it will boost your mood and keep you healthy.

, Unrealistic thoughts are common when you are depressed. It is important to challenge these thoughts. One thing you can do is to challenge the thoughts and turn them into more realistic ones.


For example, if you find yourself thinking, “Nobody likes me,” then you could challenge this thought and say to yourself, “Well, that is not true. Some people like me a lot, such as my mom, my best friend, and my teacher.” This is a much more realistic thought.
Practice challenging and rewriting your thoughts as they arise to help you steer clear of unrealistic thinking.

, Depression is very real and unfortunately, very common. You are not alone and you're feelings are important. Depression can make things worse because it affects the way you feel and the way you think. You might start to believe that things will never improve or that you will feel like this forever. That is not right, and is not healthy to feel that way. Take time to focus on your strengths, the things you do very well.


Write down five things you are good at.
Write down five things you like about yourself.
Write down something that you can do to feel better about yourself when you are down.

, When you are feeling sad, it may be tempting to cancel plans with a friend or to ask to stay home from school because you don’t feel well. While doing these things may seem like a good idea, it is better to stick with your normal routine no matter what.


Going out and doing something when you feel sad might seem impossible, but it can actually make you feel better.
If you feel like skipping school or an event due to feeling sad, try telling yourself something like, “I know this seems like a good idea now, but I will probably feel better if I just go.”

, Having hobbies and activities that you like can be used as a way to cope with your depression. Hobbies or activities can include sports, games, crafts, or whatever else you find fun. Take short breaks from the stress of dealing with depression, and do things that make you feel good.Allow yourself to pay attention to something else and be distracted from any negative thoughts you are having.This will not only help you feel better, but it will help you recharge, and make you that much more focused later on.


Make sure that you are taking time to do serious things as well, such as school. Make sure your depression does not cause you to fall too far behind in your studies.
Take a short break and watch an episode of your favorite TV show.
Do a craft or project.
Go out with friends to a movie.

, Learning how to use a relaxation technique can be a beneficial way to help soothe and calm yourself when you are feeling overwhelmed by your feelings. Try setting aside at least 15 minutes every day to just relax. Go to a calm, pleasant place, such as in your room or under a tree in your backyard. Some good relaxation techniques to learn include:



Meditation.

Yoga.

Progressive muscle relaxation.

Deep breathing.

Learn about depression.,
Keep track of your depression.,
Deal with the cause of your depression.",How to Get Over Depression as a Kid3," It is important for you to learn about what depression is an how you experience it. Depression is more than feelings of sadness. Reading the signs of depression and beginning to pick out what you experience will help you communicate your feelings to others. You might not have all of the following signs and may have a sign or two that are not in this list.Sad mood, feelings of not being worth anything, a lack of hope, or thinking negatively.Difficulty sleeping, waking up, or constant oversleeping.
Finding that you are more hungry or less hungry than usual or that you have lost or gained weight.

Consider writing in a journal every day about it.After awhile you might be able to notice if there are certain patterns in how you are feeling. Figuring out your patterns might help you pick out what is behind or causing your depression. Ask yourself the following questions.


Are there times where you find that you are more depressed than others? Or where things feel more difficult, such as in the morning or at night?
Do you find you are more depressed or experience more signs during the winter months?
Are you more sad after spending time with certain people or doing certain activities?

, By tracking how you are feeling, hopefully you have realized what might be behind your depression.

Talk through possible solutions with people who can help. Solutions may include having someone walk you home, or having teachers keep an eye out for bullying.
If the school does not handle it in the best way, then a drastic life change such as changing schools may be necessary. Your happiness is what is most important.
If it is a result of a medical condition or a chemical imbalance, follow the treatment your doctor has planned for you.

Make a list of all dreams and aspirations.,
If any emotional tense/stress resonating from your past experiences/disasters, do not be afraid to talk to someone.,
Care for your own well-being.,
If you truly aren't satisfied with your overall appearance and you feel yourself ready, then shake up your appearance.,
No matter your age, you're never too old or too mature to have a Facebook account or one of the various personal spaces on the internet.,
Join a club.,
Work up gradually to this one.",How to Gain That Much Required Sense of Self Confidence (Girls)," Make a list of present and future aspirations whether it be just scribbling something on a scrap piece of paper. This, in itself, is a step-by-step process that you personally want to accomplish. Remember that there is no limit to your dreams, they can be infinitive: never believe that your goal is impossible. There is no deadline (you can do within your own time).;
, Or better yet, talk to a qualified psychologist. There is logic in accomplishing this, by allowing yourself to release all anxieties brimming underneath the surface (however painful) you are making a significant leap in the right direction of gainful a better impression of yourself from your own perspective. This, in itself is a gradual process. Psychologists are not there to judge but to help you think things through.

, Allow yourself (, not always, but) to help yourself e.g. a bubble bath will do wonders... listen to your favourite music. In this way, you are allowing yourself (however short) a moment to give yourself some importance that you perhaps wouldn't usually. Hygiene is important for you both mentally and emotionally as you're more likely to feel rejuvenated and content in brushing your teeth, washing your face etc.

, This is one of the biggest and overall visible sign of gaining a greater likeness for yourself e.g. a new hair cut, colouring, removing braces, ear piercing etc. From this you are admitting to starting a new chapter in your life and representing yourself as someone you want to be.

, Make a plan beforehand of what you want to put as your status and profile. If uncertain, don't feel pressured. Better yet, write down your interests, hobbies, likes/dislikes that you would like to publicise for all your friends to see. This is welcoming to other people (no matter if you don't have much of a relationship with them at the moment), to realise there is more to you than meets the eye (both friendship/romantic wise).

, It can vary really, doesn't have to be specific, something more over the lines of: Youth Theatre, Cricket, Choir, Hobbies, A sport... anything at all: take your pick! You'll probably start to make the obvious between point 5 & 6 as they both are associated in making social interaction with other people and in the same way showing yourself off as talented and sharing enthusiasm for that particular club or linked interest. This is a method of keeping yourself content: physically, emotionally and mentally especially if, like I was, you tend to over think and back out of things too soon before you've realised what's out there.

, Do something you wouldn't ordinarily do, sounds scary but it isn't really once you get the idea. Basically do something out of spontaneity! We all know that change is scary but at the same thing it is important to note that it can also be a healthy method towards self-confidence. A good example would be e.g get dressed up and go out with friends... remember work at this gradually and build up. Even take photos as memories as post them on your Facebook wall tagging your friends at the same time, you'll make them feel special too if you include them positively.


Spontaneity can also mean doing things by yourself. You don't necessarily need friends with you and sometimes, if you're a beginner especially at building self-esteem, it can be the beauty of it! Enjoy yourself. Perhaps randomly, buy yourself a dress that you've imagined yourself wearing. A new dress can do wonders to make yourself feel young and girly or slightly older and more sophisticated. Don't be afraid if you don't have a potential event to wear it to. If you have a few close friends, you'll think of something.

Cut a ping pong ball in half.,
Turn on white noise.,
Manage the lighting.,
Tape the ping pong balls on your eyes.,
Wait for any hallucinations.",How to Get High Without Drugs3," The Ganzfeld technique is one that utilizes sensory deprivation to produce hallucinations and other unusual mental states. In order to block out the sight you will be using ping pong ball halves, placing them over your eyes. Get a ping pong ball and cut it directly and evenly in half to begin.Draw a guideline with a marker or pen to make sure your cut will be even and straight.
You can try cutting the ping pong ball with a razor or sharp knife.

, In order to block out your sense of sound the Ganzfeld technique suggests that you play white noise or radio static. This noise will prevent you from hearing other distinct sounds and may allow you to experience auditory hallucinations within the meaningless static.


You can find white noise generators on-line.
If you have a radio you can try tuning it to a station that is only static.
It's best to use headphones to ensure that the only sound you hear is the white noise.

, You will need to find a level of lighting that is not too dark and not too bright in order to get the most from the Ganzfeld technique. The ideal lighting should be dim and indirect, allowing you to see the light through the ping pong balls but not brightly.You can try using a lamp, moving it closer or further away from you to control the brightness.
The original Ganzfeld experiments used red lighting.

, Once you have created the rest of your space, finding a source of dim lighting and white noise, you can now tape the ping pong ball halves over your eyes. Taping the ping pong lids over your eyes will block your sense of sight almost entirely while allowing only the indirect lighting to come through.Use a gentle and easily removable adhesive tape to affix the ping pong halves over your eyes.
Make sure the ping pong ball fully covers your eyes.
Be careful when taping the ping pong balls to your eyes.
Once affixed, keep your eyes open under the cover of the ping pong ball halves.

, The sensory deprivation will allow your mind to wander and create very detailed and interesting experiences. Your eyes and ears will try to fill in the details that are denied by the white noise and soft light entering through the ping pong balls. Stick with it for a few minutes, relaxing and awaiting any strange or unusual sounds or sights that your mind may produce.You may see something simple at first such as a swirling light or mist.
You may experience very clear mental images.
You may hear noises that sound as if they are nearby or in the room with you.
You may experience very engaging and realistic hallucinations that involve all of your senses.
If you feel uncomfortable or any unwanted effects occur stop immediately.

Don't take things too seriously.",How to Find Meaning in Your Life (for Teens)," Get some excitement in your life. Don't be a couch potato. Exercise for at least 20 minutes a day. Go for a jog once in a while, do some extra sit-ups, or just a walk.;
, With friends, you'll feel more important and like you always have someone to rely on. Make sure these are true friends who like you for you -- not two-faced ones who are shallower than a kiddy pool. Go out more often instead of being a shut-in.

, Help your community, volunteer to help work with a charity or two, and always lend a helping hand to someone in need.

, Not only are you helping save a poor animal's life, but you also can build a long-term friendship with your pet. Instead of buying one from a pet store or breeder, go to your local pound and adopt one. If nobody adopts an animal, it will be put to sleep.

, Not only will you get paid, but you'll be helping make people's lives easier. If you've never had a job before, it is best to not jump-start into something big that takes up all of your time.

, Do you eat 5 fruits and vegetables a day? Do you drink 64 oz. of water a day? Or do you stuff yourself with chips and soda? If you are overweight, consider going on a diet to get in shape.

, Some people find more fulfillment in their life when they have a romantic partner to share it with. You're still a teenager, so don't fall head-over-heels in love and make plans to get married. Take it at an easy pace that you feel comfortable. Don't rush into things. And remember, it's okay to date more than one person at a time as long as you have only one steady boyfriend or girlfriend at one time.

, Haven't you ever wondered what you would look like with bangs? What about if you cut your hair short? Hair is a great way to express yourself and if you refresh your hairstyle, you could refresh your self-image, too. You could also get some new clothes, if you can afford it. Donate your old ones to charity instead of throwing them out and buy some new ones. Try looking through shops at the mall. Try out some new clothes without changing drastically in one day.

, Okay, so you're filling out a survey. It has a space that reads, ""What are your hobbies?"" And you're sitting there staring at the question as if it was a question on your math test that your teacher forgot to teach you, and you can't figure it out on your own because you forgot to study. You don't have to be like that anymore! Find something fun by trying out some new activities -- just nothing dangerous. You'd be surprised how many fun things there are out there that you haven't tried yet! Spend all of your time on the computer? Try cooking or sewing. They may sound boring, but they can be a heck of a lot of fun if you just give them a chance instead of immediately sticking your nose up toward them.

, Why can't life be fun? Oh, that's right, it can! Be optimistic. Talk to someone you trust when you have a problem and when you get sad, smile anyway--it could be way worse. Be grateful for what you have and never give up.

Identify what you're anxious about.,
Talk to an adult.,
Solve what you can.,
Try taking deep breaths.,
Find a happy place.,
Be nice to your body.,
Go to bed.",How to Enjoy Being Young1," Most people get worried or anxious from time to time. However, as you grow, you can learn to deal with your worries. You still may be worried, but it won't affect your life or mood as much. The first step is identifying what you're worried about.For instance, maybe you're worried about your grades, your family, or your friendships. Maybe you're worried about an upcoming test or exam. On the other hand, maybe you've been watching the news a little too much, and you're scared about where the world is. Try writing about what you're scared about in a journal or notebook.;
, It's best to talk to your parents, if possible. If you can't for some reason, find someone else you trust, such as a coach or teacher. If you're worrying all the time, an adult can help you sort through what to do.

Even if the adult can't solve your problem, just talking to someone can help you feel better., If something you're worried about has a solution, work to bring that solution about. If you can't come up with a solution, make sure to ask your parents if they have any ideas. Because they have more experience, they may be able to figure it out., When you find yourself getting worried, take a moment to stop and breath. Deep breathing can help calm your stress.All that means is you close your eyes and focus only on breathing deeply. Try counting to four in your head as you breathe all the way in through your nose. Breathe out through your mouth, also counting to four in your head. Keep breathing until you feel yourself calm down.

, When you're starting to get worried about something, find someplace that's calming to you. Maybe it's the garden in your backyard, or maybe you find peace in the kitchen, where your family is. Many people find being in nature to be calming, so take a walk if you can. Finding a place that calms you can help you deal with stress and anxiety., Anxiety can crop up more when you're not being healthy. To help cut down on your stress, eat your fruits and vegetables. Be sure to drink plenty of water, and get out and exercise every day.

If you're over 13 years of age, you should be drinking at least eight glasses of water a day.To make sure you are drinking enough, try keeping water with you throughout the day. If you don't like plain water, add a squeeze of lemon or orange to help add flavor.
Some exercises you could try include swimming, playing kickball, playing tag in the backyard, jumping rope, swinging, or running. Try to get outside and get moving every day. If the weather is cold, ask your parents if you can get a membership to the local YMCA or try playing video games that encourage you get up and move.

, If you're not getting enough sleep, you're going to be cranky. If you're cranky, you're going to be worrying more. Make sure you are getting to bed on time so that you are getting the rest you need. Depending on your age, you may need anywhere from 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night.

Try a script.,
Try a compliment.,
Be kind.,
Talk to people you know.,
Ask your parents if you can have people over.,
Watch what other people do.",How to Enjoy Being Young2," If you have trouble making friends, that may mean you need a little practice learning what to say at home. It's fine if you need to practice a bit first. Ask your parents to help you figure out what to say to someone you'd like to be your friend or practice on your own.Make eye contact when you walk up to a kid you want to talk to. In addition, make sure you smile.Say ""Hello!"" Once you've said hello, invite your new friend to sit with you at lunch or to listen to your favorite song. For instance, you could say, ""Hi, I'm Jessie. I know you don't know me, but I was wondering if you wanted to sit with me at lunch?""

, Everyone likes to hear that they look nice or that you like the shirt they're wearing. If you want to talk to someone new, try a greeting first, but then launch into a compliment, such as ""You're shirt is really awesome! I love unicorns, too.""Giving someone a compliment makes them feel good, and it gives them an opportunity to say something back to you. It gives you an instant connection.

, Kindness goes along way in making friendships. For instance, maybe you could offer to help a classmate who's having trouble lifting a box, or maybe you could carry a book for someone. When you do nice things for people, they want to respond in the same way, and it can open the way for friendships., If you're not big on talking to people you don't know, start with people you do. That is, the more you hold conversations with people, the better you will be in any situation, even when making new friends., When you make new friends, sometimes it's best to spend some time making that friendship stronger by spending more time together. If you can go to your house, you can do activities together and learn about each other.

, If you're unsure how to act around other kids your age, watch what other people do. See how your mom treats her friends. Watch how other kids talk to each other. The more you observe, the better you will be at doing it yourself.

Giggle for your health.,
Look for things that make you laugh.,
Learn to laugh at yourself.,
Tell jokes.,
Take time to play.",How to Enjoy Being Young3," Laughing is good for you. It can help you make friends and it can help you feel less stressed. In fact, laughter can help relieve the tension in your muscles from stress, making you feel more relaxed.

Laughing may even keep you from getting sick as much because it boosts your immune system.One way laughter helps you feel less anxious is it floods your brain with serotonin, a hormone that makes you feel good., While some things make most people laugh, you'll find things that you think are funny that other people don't. Learn what you think is funny by reading books that are labelled ""humor,"" watching funny cat videos, or asking your friends and family for jokes. As you go along, you'll figure out what you think is funny. Once you do, make sure to include it as a part of your life every day so that you laugh every day.

, You are going to make mistakes from time to time. Everybody does. The difference is how you learn to respond. If you get angry at yourself, you're just going to make the situation tense. However, if you can learn to laugh at yourself when you've done something silly, it helps to ease the tension in the room and make you less stressed, too.

For instance, if you add sugar to your dinner instead of salt, you could get angry and throw your plate. That will get your family upset at you. However, if you laugh at the silly mistake instead, everyone else will probably giggle, too. The mistake you made is not such a big one, in the scheme of things.

, Once you start seeing what you find funny, it's fun to tell a joke yourself. You can use one someone else told you, or you can make up one yourself.To tell one, you can introduce it if you want by saying, ""Hey, I've got a joke for you."" When the other person says, ""okay,"" go ahead and tell it.

, Everyone needs to play, even adults, though they may not always remember it. Even if you feel like you're too old for play, you still need time to let your imagination run wild. You can call it something else if it makes you feel better.

For instance, you can try doodling or messing around in the garden. Kick a ball around, or enjoy a board game with a friend. You can play with your stuffed animals and dolls, even if you have to dig them out of the back of your closet.

Plan something in the future.",How to Enjoy Life As a Teen," Whether it's having a computer, having friends, having a good supply of food, a bed to sleep on, family that loves you, having a decent education or simply being born in this world. Remember that the point of life is for you to enjoy it. Be happy, and life will reward you. Remember that these are the last few years you will be able to enjoy yourself without having to worry about the responsibility of an adult, but make sure you prepare yourself for when you do become one. When you actually become an adult, you'll learn to love that responsibility and you probably never want to go back.;
, Unlike what many articles state, you don't have to be popular and have a gazillion friends to be happy. In fact, many of the ""friends"" you have when you are popular are not true friends. Try to have friends that like you who you are, not just because you are wearing a certain brand of shoes or something like that. These are people who shop at the same store as you; not someone who will sympathize with you when your dog dies.

, Having a healthy body leads to a healthy and happy mind. Being confident in your appearance makes you more confident in other areas.

, Participating in clubs, activities, and sports increases your chances of meeting new friends. While you only need 4 or 5 close friends, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to meet new people. Participating gives you something to do instead of sitting bored at home and wallowing in self-pity.

, If you have a special girl/guy you want to ask out, dance with, etc. just ask! You probably won't be rejected but if you are, remember that there will always be someone else that likes you for who you are. Don't go to sleep that night wishing you would have asked them. About 90% of the girls or guys you talk to will like you back, only about 10% probably will reject or badmouth you.

, There is nothing more satisfying than seeing your hard work pay off in the form of A's and B's (but mainly A's). This also sets you up to get into a college you want to go to, which in turn prepares you for a career you will enjoy, improving your quality of life in the future. You'll get cheap car insurance as well if you have at least a B or A average.

, Video games, for example, are good if you're the type who can get into that kind of thing. You should also find a hobby that is meaningful or practical. Use your ""hobby time"" to either A) Volunteer (to gain practical skills for college apps, job resumes, and scholarships) B. Learn an instrument, or get into something else in the creative field like painting or dance, because this is the time to start developing and uncovering passions that might otherwise lie dormant.

, Working is a great way to gain experience and to meet other people. When you do get out of college, interviewing companies will look at your prior work experience. This will look great on your resume. If you can't find work, especially in this hard economic time, volunteer or make your own job.

, But remember to give yourself a break when you fail.

, You always regret the things you don't do.

, You'll still be going to games for free like the jocks if you are in pep band, and you have as many opportunities to meet new people as the jocks. Band and choir sometimes involves going on trips, and are great memories to have for high school and college.

Realize that not everyone is dating.,
Recognize the benefits.,
Busy yourself.,
Don't become a third wheel.,
Explore.,
Don't be desperate.,
Don't worry, be happy.,
Do the stuff you really want to do!,
Write a contract.",How to Enjoy Being Single As a Teen Girl," The next time you go to one of your classes, look around. Look at every one of the girls in your class, and try to think whether she is dating or not. (If you don't know, assume she isn't.) Chances are, you'll find that not everyone has a boyfriend. However, if you find that every girl you looked at for sure has a boyfriend, do not be discouraged. There are probably plenty of other girls in your school who are not dating.;
, Think about it. Your friends who are taken can't go to a party and flirt with that hot new guy. They can't go out as often. They often feel they can't go out dressed as sexy, for fear guys will ""ogle"" them. Meanwhile, you can go out whenever (you don't have to stay in because ""Chad said he'd call me sometime between 4 and 10""), you can dress up as hot as you want, and you can flirt shamelessly.

, If you find that your old Friday night gal pals are all out with their ""guy pals"", please resist the urge to sit inside watching The Notebook and eating a tub of Häagen-Dazs! Go online and look up a facial mask recipe. Do your homework. Paint your nails. Watch a brand new thriller movie. Read a book. Catch up on some beauty sleep. Have fun on wikiHow. These are just some of the things you could be doing (which your taken friends will not be doing!).

, This is crucial. It's extremely awkward to be the only one not cuddled up in a booth at Boston Pizza, or trying to hear the movie over the slurpy (ew!) sounds of couples making out. If some of your friends invite you out, and you realize that you'll be the odd one out, invite another single friend (or call your crush!) or just don't go. If you choose not to go, refer to step number three.

, You're young. You're single. Don't sit around all day moping: do something about it! Scope out some new cuties, or call that summer fling. If your town has the same old guys, you're crushing on someone who is unattainable like a teacher or someone's math teacher (shocking!), or you simply haven't had any summer flings or just don't like anyone at the moment, don't worry! Maybe your friend's boyfriend's cousin would like to meet up sometime. Maybe that foreign exchange student isn't so weird after all. Maybe you've begun to find the guy next door a lot more attractive than the lifeguard at the pool. It doesn't matter. You've got your whole life ahead of you.

, Please, please, please don't run around throwing yourself at every boy you see. You don't have to dress a certain way (put down the tube top and micro-mini), do your hair or makeup a certain way, or act a certain way to get a guy. It may sound totally like something you have heard a hundred times before , but be yourself, and you will find somebody who likes you for who you are. It may not be this week, this month, this year, or even during high school. But you will find someone.

, In the end, your single friends still love you (a girls night out with the fellow single chicks is a good thing), your taken friends still love you (they can talk to you about guy woes without hearing ""oh yeah? Well Brandon said this in our last fight...""), your family still loves you, and somewhere, a future partner is waiting to love you. For now, hold your head up high, smile, love (and be loved), and live.

, One of the benefits of being single is you now have more spare time to do the stuff you really want to do! Spoil yourself, donate to charity, try a new sport, flirt a little, read and write stories, spend time with your friends, call an old friend, make a website, do homework, chat online, etc.

, Promise yourself things that you'll do when you start dating such as: clear your schedule from time to time to do the things you want to do, make time for schoolwork, balance your life, etc.

Be Priceless.",How to Enjoy Every Day of Your Life," It doesn't matter what the age range is on the program. It could be a show for children aged Pre-K to 11 years old. It's the easiest way to take a break from the surrounding world. It may sound childish, but today, most children's shows are laced with a bit of humor that can be enjoyed by even the oldest viewer. Many programs also offer educational value, and bilingual characters. You may learn something new, meanwhile, feeding the kid in you!;
, Google is an amazing search engine which allows you to access pictures, video, and information on just about anything. Try googling different locations around the world. Check them out on Google maps. Read about these locations. Discover websites that uncover amazing facts about the location. Read reviews from people who have traveled to this destination. Find pictures and ultimately decide if you'd like to visit this destination. Publish your findings in a small journal. Not only to highlight these amazing places on Earth, but to see how much you've learned since you began! You may find that you have a new paradise to look forward to or perhaps an island that currently holds mysteries beyond science. The world is your oyster and to learn more about your world is to be enlightened about your own life.

, Whether you're an amazing cook and can handle cooking a new dish, or would prefer to order-out from the professionals, a new dish is only a call or restaurant visit away! You could even start by trying a new native meal and eventually trying a dish from another culture. Opening your palate and tasting what the world has to offer is an amazing way to uncover some culinary arts that you may have otherwise allowed to pass you by.

, Even the smallest goals, including paying a bill on time or larger ones such as working to eliminate a debt will make you feel successful when you finally can cross them off. Anything worth having is worth working for, so don't get discouraged. Write at least 20 you'd like to accomplish in the next Year and work them off. Don't wait for a New Year's resolution to change your life. Put forward a little progress toward a goal everyday. Be Happy about what you accomplished, because YOU did it! Treat yourself when they are completed.

, No amount of anything, be it money or otherwise, will make you happy if you are unhappy with yourself. Even those with large fortunes still manage to get plastic surgery and blow excessive amounts of money to replace the self-esteem which only comes from within.

, Allow the knowledge you carried afterwards to make you a stronger & wiser person. It's only a problem if you keep repeating these mistakes. Accept the past altogether. While it is easier said than done, it must be done. You cannot alter history. As devastating or hurtful as the past can be, it is the future we look toward and can impact. Use tragedy as an outlet to join community efforts that seek to prevent/support that cause. Remember that whatever you are doing should be toward making a better tomorrow. Not rehashing the past. If you find yourself thinking more of the past than your future perhaps you should seek the help of a professional/family member/church member that you can talk to to help to give you the nudge you need to move forward with your beautiful life.

, There are people in this world who although they may not know you, love you. This could be distant family or perhaps, a stranger who simply believes in your potential. Know that you are loved and exude that love to those around you so that you may reap the reward of being an exemplary example of human kindness and self-fulfillment. You have to love yourself in order to love others entirely., There is no amount of monetary value that can be placed on changing someone's life in a positive way. Be the first to lend a hand or simply listen to someone. Even if you aren't the person you'd like to be today, love yourself and send love to the person you're working so hard to become.

, Instead of trying to force these feelings away, start accounting for them in your life and considering what purpose each one has in making your life more fulfilling.

, Keep a journal of your feelings and how they improve your performance at work, during leisure, within the family, etc. and start focusing on using these emotions more intelligently to improve your relations with others.

, You have them for a reason, to express them, come to terms with them and in so doing, you will hasten your own healing processes. If it were originally meant for men ""not to cry"", then men ideally would have been created with no tear ducts. The anatomy of men would have been built differently.

Go for a hard workout.,
Talk to a friend.,
Take deep breaths.,
Go for a walk.,
Think about something funny.,
Count to ten.,
Engage in perspective-taking.,
Replace your angry thoughts with more productive ones.,
Try to find a solution to the problem.",How to Deal With Your Teenage Anger1," One way to deal with your anger is to vent it in ways that ultimately benefit you. Use the negative energy of your anger to your benefit by going for a long run or hitting the weights. Rigorous exercise can help you reduce your anger and help you cope with stressors that trigger anger in the first place. Try listening to music that pumps you up; this will help you endure when your workout gets tough.;
, Tell your friend or significant other what is making you angry. In many cases, simply venting your frustrations will help you to cope with your anger, even if there is no solution presented from the conversation.You may find that your friend or significant other is going through the same problems as you, and it can help to not feel like you are the only one dealing with the issues making you angry.

, When you find yourself trying to deal with anger, try to calm yourself down. You can accomplish this by breathing deeply. This will help you to initiate your body’s calming response.


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.

, If it is possible for you to escape the anger-inducing situation that you are in, do so and go for a walk. You will be able to calm down easier if you distance yourself from the situation that made you upset.If you, e.g., in class and you are very angry but are not allowed to leave, try pulling your teacher aside and asking her to use the washroom. If she won’t allow you to, try calmly explaining to her that you are angry about something and would appreciate a couple minutes away from the situation to calm down.
If you absolutely cannot leave the situation, try to remove yourself from it through your imagination. Imagine you are on a vacation to your favourite place in the world. Try your best to picture all the sights, sounds, and smells to make your vision more vivid.

, Although easier said than done when you are angry, if you can get yourself laughing, you can change your emotional state. You can use your brain and imagination to create all sorts of ridiculous situations that can get you laughing. , If you feel yourself getting angry, remember that you don’t have to react right away. Tell yourself you will let your anger show itself after a ten second delay if you still feel angry after those ten seconds. Counting to ten can help you put off your feelings for the moment. It might feel a bit silly at first, but counting really can distract your long enough to calm down.

, If someone made you angry, do your best to consider things from her perspective. Ask yourself whether she might have done the behavior on accident, or whether her behavior was constrained by the situation in some way (e.g., maybe she had no choice) or whether she may have had reason to do what she did. Also ask yourself whether you have ever made a similar mistake. If you fail to take her perspective, this may contribute to your anger, since we tend to underestimate situational influences on others’ behavior (this is called the fundamental attribution error).If you take her perspective you might realize that sometimes people make mistakes, just as you do, or you may realize that she didn’t have mean intentions, either of which can reduce your own anger.

, The method of “cognitive restructuring” can help you replace old, dysfunctional thoughts with thoughts that will help you function better throughout your day.Anger can distort our thoughts, making us think that something is way more important than it really is. When we exaggerate the importance of an event, our anger can get out of control.


For example, if you get a flat tire on the way to school, it’s annoying and inconvenient. Out of control anger might lead you to these thoughts: “I can’t believe my stupid tire went flat! Now my entire week is ruined. Everything at school is going to be horrible.”
We can change these thoughts by challenging them. Life usually doesn’t meet extreme conditions, such as always and never. You got a flat tire. Things like this happen in life, and things happen that you can’t control. There could have been glass in the road or sharp rocks to cause the flat tire.
Use your reasoning before your body gets out of control. Before anger takes over your mind, you can “talk yourself down.”
Challenge your thoughts by asking, ""how will my whole week really be ruined by this flat tire?"" ""Do I still have good things to look forward to, despite this inconvenience?"" ""Last time something bad happened, did I get over it eventually?""

, With problem solving, you are doing everything in your power to address the problem. You need to figure out your own feelings regarding the situation. Then you need to express them in the most productive way you can.You might have to accept the fact that at this time, there isn’t a solution to the problem. You may not be able to control the problem, but you can control how you react towards it.
For example, you might be angry with your parents because they won’t let you attend a concert with your friends. You can still be angry, but it is also productive to talk with your parents calmly to figure out a solution. You might say to yourself:

”I am going to take a few minutes to myself. I’m going go to my room and play my favorite song, and breathe deeply to calm down.”
“I want my parents to treat me like an adult. I am not yet an adult, but I feel I can handle myself. I need to calm down and get my brain clear. My body is in the middle of this stress reaction and my head isn’t thinking clearly.”
”As I am deep breathing, I am thinking of ways to talk with my parents. I will ask them to tell me their reasons for saying no. I will talk calmly about why I want to go.”
”If they still won’t let me go, I will suggest a compromise. I will ask if one of them wants to drop me off and pick me up. Even if they still say no, they will see that I am reacting like an adult and they will see that I am becoming more mature. Maybe that will help the next time I want to go to a concert.”

Practice reading others’ expressions.,
Double-check your perceptions with others.,
Avoid responding with physical aggression.,
Avoid expressing your anger in a passive way.,
Avoid expressing your anger in an aggressive way.,
Express your anger assertively.,
Be respectful.,
Communicate your own feelings.,
Make your communications clear and specific.,
Keep an anger journal.,
Assess what triggers your anger.",How to Deal With Your Teenage Anger2," When you react with anger and frustration in a situation, sometimes it’s because you misunderstand how other people feel. Having a better understanding of what other people feel will help you figure out how to react appropriately in certain situations.


Try looking at pictures of different faces to see if you can “read” emotions. Even looking through a magazine or a photo album can be helpful. Search online for “reading emotions” to find examples of faces that you can test yourself with. For example, the DNA Learning Center has some tools to learn how to read faces.

, Sometimes, when you think that someone is getting angry with you, you might respond by getting angry back at this person. But before the misunderstanding escalates, check in with the other person to learn more about what he is feeling.


Try saying, “Did I say something wrong?” or “Are we okay?” This will give both of you a chance to check in with your feelings before you get into an argument.

, When you get angry, your first impulse may be to hit, push, or kick someone. If you are responding to a bully, you are giving this person what he wants, which is a reaction from you. If you are bullying someone else, you are responding with violence that can hurt someone.If you feel like you need to punch or hit, rather than hitting a person, hit an object, like a pillow.

, In passive anger expression, you don’t actually deal directly with the person who hurt or angered you. Instead, you get even with them in other ways, such as talking negatively behind the person’s back or insulting the person at a later time.

, Aggressive anger expressions, such as shouting at someone, are the most problematic. There is the possibility of violence and negative consequences for failure to control angry outbursts. This can interfere with everyday functioning if anger happens frequently and is out of control.

, Assertive expression of anger is the most constructive way to express anger. Assertiveness cultivates mutual respect for each other. Anger is expressed, but in a way where it is non-accusatory and mutually respectful.Assertive communication emphasizes that both people’s needs are important. To communicate assertively, give the facts without making accusations. Here is an example:“I was hurt and angry because it seems like you were belittling my project when you laughed during my presentation. I don’t know what was going on, but it seems like you weren’t paying attention or taking my hard work seriously. I could have just misunderstood what was going on. Can we talk and work this out?”

, In order to get respect, you have to give it. Then you will foster cooperation and reciprocal respect. Your communications should convey requests rather than demands. Using please and thank you is not only polite, but it also shows respect for others.


“When you have the time, could you…”
“It would be a great help if you… Thanks, I appreciate it!”

, When you figure out how you’re feeling, convey the real feeling, like hurt, and keep judgment statements out of it. Stick to what you feel.


For example, you could say: “It seems to me that you are not being sensitive to my feelings when you read your paper instead of listening to what I’m trying to say.”

, Be sure to get your point across by stating exactly what the issue is. For instance, if your co-worker is speaking very loudly on the phone and it’s difficult for you to do your work, you can state your request like this:


“Would you please lower the volume of your voice on the telephone? It’s making it very difficult for me to concentrate on my work. I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.” By saying this, you are directly addressing the other person. You are making it clear what you need and letting him know why it is a problem for you.

, As you engage in social interactions, keep track of what makes you upset. An anger journal will help you find patterns that you can then use to tailor a specific anger management strategy for yourself. Keeping track of this information will help you learn what triggers your anger. Then you can avoid those situations when possible, or take steps to reduce your anger in situations that are unavoidable.
When you record in your journal, you can make the following observations:

What provoked the anger?
What thoughts occurred as you got angry?



, A trigger is something that precedes and causes your feelings of anger. Once you start tracking your anger by writing down when it occurs and what causes it, you can start to look for patterns. Some common trigger patterns for anger include:


Not being able to control other’s actions.
Other people disappointing you for not meeting your expectations.
Not being able to control daily life events.
Someone trying to manipulate you.
Getting mad at yourself for a mistake.

Talk with a trusted adult.,
See a therapist.,
Take an anger management class.,
Ask your doctor about medication.",How to Deal With Your Teenage Anger3," Angry feelings can be very overwhelming. It can also be difficult to know what to do with them. Talking with a trusted adult will be helpful in figuring out your feelings. This adult might be a parent, another family member, a teacher or counselor, or another adult friend. You can also ask your doctor about your feelings. This person can share his own experiences in dealing with angry feelings. He can also give you some perspective on your own feelings., Therapy is a great way to find new ways of dealing and expressing anger.Plenty of people see therapists when they want to learn some skills that will improve their lives. Other people see a therapist because they have been through a difficult time and need to talk about it.


Your therapist will most likely use relaxation techniques to help you calm down in the middle of an anger episode. Your therapist will also help you deal with the thoughts that can trigger anger and find new ways to view your situations.
You can see a therapist on your own or with your family. Think about what you would feel most comfortable with. Talk with your parents or a trusted adult about your interest in trying therapy.Therapists will also help you with emotional coping skills and assertiveness communication training.
Some psychotherapists specialize in helping clients work through their personal history, such as overcoming an abusive or neglectful childhood, or overcoming a tragic event. These therapists can be helpful in dealing with anger from past events.

, Anger management programs have been shown to have a high rate of success. The most successful programs help you understand your anger, give you short-term strategies to deal with your anger, and help you build skills.There are anger management programs specifically geared towards children, teens and families. Search online to find one in your area.

, Anger is often a part of different disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. Drug therapy for anger will depend on the condition the anger is occurring with. Taking the medications for the disorder could help the anger as well.For example, if the anger is occurring with depression, antidepressants can treat depression symptoms as well as anger. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Lexapro or Zoloft might be used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. These drugs can also help relieve irritability you may experience as part of your anxiety.
Each drug has side effects. For example, lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, has a very high rate of renal (kidney) complications. Being aware of the possible side effects will help you monitor for complications. It’s very important to discuss these possibilities openly with your doctor.

There is a small possibility that teens may experience suicidal thoughts when taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), especially in the first 4 weeks of treatment.SSRIs are commonly used for treating depression and anxiety.

Recognize how your anger can negatively affect your interactions.,
Recognize how anger can affect your health.,
Check to see if you’re bullying.",How to Deal With Your Teenage Anger4," If you need help getting motivation to maintain a strategy for dealing with your angry, then get a sense of how your anger can negatively impact your life. Anger can become a big problem if it causes you to act aggressively towards other people. When anger is a constant reaction to everyday events and to the people around you, even your loved ones, you may have trouble finding enjoyment in life.


Anger can interfere with your job, your relationships with the ones you love, and your social life. You might even get incarcerated if you assault another person., When you’re frequently angry, your physical health can take a hit. Out-of-control anger or suppressed anger can cause:Physical difficulties: These might include an aching back or head, high blood pressure, sleeplessness, indigestion, skin disorders, or irritable bowel syndrome.

Anger and hostility also put people at higher risk for heart disease.Anger and hostility are better predictors of heart disease, even over other factors such as smoking and obesity.


Mental health issues: Anger can contribute to an increased likelihood of depression, anorexia or bulimia, alcohol or drug addiction, self-harming (cutting), low self-worth, and quickly cycling mood states (happy one minute, unhappy the next). Your anger won't necessarily cause these issues, but it can contribute to them.

Irritability, which is on the spectrum of anger-related feelings, is a symptom of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The connection between anger and GAD is not fully understood. But some experts think that when people have GAD, they tend to be passive in their way of dealing with anger (for example, having anger but not showing it).Immune system difficulties: Anger constantly bombards the immune system, since the body’s stress response shuts down our immune system. Illnesses such as colds and flus are higher for people who have higher levels of anger., If your anger is causing you to bully other people, you might be inflicting potentially long-lasting emotional pain on them. If you are venting your anger by bullying others, you may look back on your teenage years with deep regret. To avoid this possibility of regret from inflicted emotional pain, try venting your anger in other ways. To vent your frustrations, try hitting a pillow or going for a long run. Types of bullying include:Verbal bullying: teasing, name-calling, inappropriate comments, taunting.
Social bullying: leaving someone out, spreading rumors, embarrassing someone in public.
Physical bullying: hitting, punching, spitting, tripping, taking someone's things, breaking someone's things.

Identify your personal values.,
Complete the best possible future self exercise.,
Reject conformity—be you.",How to Emotionally Transition Into Adulthood1," Being an adult emotionally means having an understanding of what you believe in and stand for. Your personal values are like the roadmap that guides you through life. They are the principles and ideas that drive your decisions and goals. When your values align with the choices you make in daily life, you feel more confident. Identify your values by asking yourself:What issues are you passionate about debating or learning about? Why?
If your house was on fire (and all living beings were safely out) what three items would you rescue? Why?
What would you like to change about your local community? What would you like to change about the world in general, and why?;
, In addition to defining your personal values, your emotional development can also be improved by determining what you want your future to look like. You can do this by performing the Best Possible Self exercise developed by positive psychologists.Choose a time period in the future (e.g. 5 years from now) and envision yourself being the very best version of you. See your best possible self clearly and vividly. See all the goals you have worked hard to achieve. You may have just passed a milestone or realized one of your major life dreams. Write down the details of the image you see.
Now, define which character strengths will be necessary—those that you already hold and those you may need to develop—for you to make this vision a reality.
Another similar option is to create a vision board. You can decorate a poster board with magazine clippings, drawings, and words and phrases that represent the short and long-term goals that you would like to achieve. Then, place the poster board where you will see it every day. As you grow and change, you can add, adjust, or remove things from the poster board.

, Another quality of an emotionally mature adult is being able to securely be who you are, without shame or fear. Adolescents and young adults are often susceptible to peer pressure, following the masses based on personal interests, style, and even behaviorism. As you mature, it is important to move past this conformist attitude in favor of having the courage and self-awareness to just be you.Even as a teenager, you have the ability to be independent in many ways. Remember that it is okay if people don’t agree with you all of the time or if you have different interests and goals compared with your peers.
Take the time to be your own unique self. Do or say something on a daily basis that expresses who you are without concern for the approval of others.
Remember what you enjoyed doing as a child, and reconnect with these interests or hobbies.
Get comfortable with solitude. Spend some time each day connecting with your deepest, truest self outside the presence of others."

Try meditation.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Eat well.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Find a creative outlet.",How to Deal With Your Teenage Anger5," Meditation has been shown to be effective in emotional regulation. Meditation has been shown to have a lasting effect on the amygdala, the center for emotion and the part of the brain where the stress response begins after a stressful or threatening event has been perceived.If you can, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom, a stairwell, or outside. Having a quiet, private space will help you feel more comfortable.
Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand). Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.
Combine breathing with visualization tasks. A simple way to do this is when you breathe in, envision a golden-white light that relaxes you and makes you feel happy. Envision this white light spreading into your lungs and throughout your entire body. When you breathe out, breathe out muddy, dark colors which represent your angry, stressed out feelings.
If you feel like you have trouble meditating, don’t worry. Meditation is a combination of deep breathing exercises, visualization, and performing mental tasks. If it’s difficult for you to sit long enough to meditate or if you feel uncomfortable meditating, you can just begin with simply deep breathing. This way, you can initiate your body’s calming response.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is the process of tensing and relaxing your entire body in progressive stages. It is thought that by tensing your muscles yourself, it will help release pent-up tension in your body.Use this method to relax your body:


Start with a few deep breaths: breathe in for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four.
Work your way from the top of your head to your feet. First, tighten the muscles in your face, head, mouth, and neck.
Hold for twenty seconds, and then release.
Then work your way down the body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back, hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Now wiggle your toes around, feeling the relaxation from your toes to your head.
Take a few more deep breaths, and enjoy the feeling of relaxation.

, Stay away from processed and fried foods, as well as refined sugars and other unhealthy foods. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables so that your body gets nutrients and vitamins that keep you healthy.


Drink plenty of water so that you don’t get dehydrated.

, Teens need about 8-9 hours of sleep per night.With busy schedules and homework, teens often stay up really late and find themselves dragging in the morning. Getting a good night’s sleep helps people regulate their emotions. Emotions are harder to control when we don’t get enough sleep. One study showed that with only a few nights of disrupted sleep for teenage girls, their negative feelings increased as well as their anger.Focus on getting enough sleep so that you feel better emotionally.


Switch off computer and phone screens about 15 to 30 minutes before you go to bed. These devices engage your brain, activating your cognitive functions and keeping you awake., Exercise is an excellent outlet to work out anger, stress and other negative feelings. For adults and children, research shows that exercise helps with mood regulation and controlling emotions. Try going out and exercising when you’re in a mad moment, or use it daily to release aggression. Play a sport, go for a jog, or work out at the gym a few times a week., , Expressing your feelings in a piece of art or writing can help you figure out your thoughts. Write in a journal or paint a picture. You might draw a comic strip, or build something out of wood."

Focus on the end goal. Rather than dwelling on the issue, think in terms of what actions can help you reach a workable solution.Change your language. Instead of using the word “problem,” try “challenge.” It doesn’t seem so difficult when you use this word.

, An emotionally mature adult is able to go through hardships and glean a lesson from them. Even mature adults make mistakes, but the difference is being able to learn from them through behavioral growth.


Recognize when you have messed up. Then, look at the variables and consider what you could have done differently and what you gained from having gone through the ordeal.For example, if you are fired from a job because you are consistently late, you can learn from this experience. At your next job, being on time should be a top priority. In addition, you may want to show more accountability by calling ahead when you just can’t help being late.

, Whether you are in late adolescence or early adulthood, you will find that a hallmark of becoming emotionally mature is autonomous decision-making. Emotionally immature adolescents and adults may put off decisions because they fear making a choice or simply follow the paths of those around them.


Meanwhile an emotionally mature adult is able to weigh the pros and cons of a situation, take time to ponder their options (i.e. don’t make rash decisions, but also don’t delay making a choice either), and move forward with confidence once the choice has been made.Emotionally mature adults may seek the advice of those around them, but they do not allow others to cloud their own judgment. In the end, they will make a decision alone based on careful consideration.

, Being emotionally mature entails making solo decisions, solving problems, and learning from your mistakes. However, an emotionally mature adult also uses their judgment to recognize when they require assistance. Of course, it’s important to take responsibility for your own life. But, you will undoubtedly encounter problems that cannot be overcome alone. In these times, you must have the courage to ask for help.


Scientists recommend practicing asking for help by requesting the assistance of others in small ways on a regular basis. Ask a friend to babysit for you, “Would you mind watching the baby this weekend?” Ask your college professor for a copy of the lecture, “Dr. Jordan, I didn’t quite understand today’s lecture. Do you have a copy of the slides so I can review them?”
The more you ask for help in small ways, you will find it becomes easier. You will also notice that most people are happy to oblige your requests."

Be okay with both positive and negative emotions.,
Remember to pause.,
Strive to develop empathy for others.,
Develop healthy coping skills.",How to Emotionally Transition Into Adulthood3," One major characteristic of an emotionally mature adult is the ability to identify, understand and accept their feelings—both good and bad. Most people won’t have trouble accepting joy or excitement. However, you may have difficulty coping with sadness or rejection.


Realize that feeling negative emotions is just as beneficial to your maturity as positive feelings. Emotions are simply a part of being human. Avoiding painful emotions like sadness can actually lead to bigger problems such as substance abuse or depression. When you accept all emotions, you learn to embrace your full humanity.Strive for acceptance by naming what you’re feeling. Describe it like “Right now, I feel rejected because I was not invited to the party. My throat is tight. I am also slightly angry and embarrassed. The tips of my ears are warm. These feelings will pass.”

, Self-control is at the core of emotional maturity. Just as you need to accept your emotions you also need to exert control over them by learning how to regulate your feelings. When you are not in control of your emotions you are at risk of acting in ways that you later regret.


Emotional maturity involves restraint. Pause and fully identify what you are feeling, pinpoint the reason you are feeling this way, and carefully devise an appropriate action.
For instance, if a friend shares your secret, you may be inclined to return the favor, telling one of theirs. By using self-control, you might rationalize that, although you feel angry, reciprocating a betrayal won’t make you feel any better. Instead you might choose to refrain from confiding in this person in the future., An emotionally mature person is open-minded and able to see the humanity in others, even when they look or think differently. Empathy is vital to becoming emotionally mature because with this trait you learn that your opinions, interests or beliefs are not the only way. Empathy allows you to consider the emotional experience of others, which can help you strengthen your bonds and avoid misunderstanding.


Increase empathy by paying more attention to the body language and temporary facial expressions of others. Consider how these signals fit into the circumstance. Then, become more aware of your own signals. How do you stand when you are angry? What micro-expression (i.e. mini facial expression) do you make when you are embarrassed?, Accepting and regulating your emotions is essential to emotional maturity, but you also need to know how to manage stress before it worsens. Building a stress-management toolbox can position you to have effective and helpful ways to release negative energy so that it doesn’t negatively affect your life. Think of activities that help you to relax and do them regularly to fend off stress.


Consider writing about your problems in a journal, practicing meditation, calling a friend, taking a walk in nature, watching a funny movie, or listening to soothing music.
In addition to adopting healthy practices, leading a healthier lifestyle also fights stress. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, eat a diet with an abundance of whole foods, drink plenty of water, and be physically active on most days of the week."
"
Use your voice.,
Avoid childish games in relationships.,
Stand behind your word.",How to Emotionally Transition Into Adulthood4," A major hallmark of becoming emotionally mature is learning how to stand up for what you believe in. The best way to do this is by setting boundaries in your relationships. Think long and hard about how you want to be treated by parents, friends, romantic partners, and coworkers. Then, come up with a list of boundaries to share with these people.


For instance, your friends crack jokes about your girlfriend. If you would like your friends to respect your relationship, you might enforce this by saying, “I asked if you could stop making jokes about Jennie. If you can’t respect that, we can’t be friends anymore.”
It’s important to follow through when you set boundaries so that people take you seriously., An emotionally mature adult doesn’t play games when it comes to matters of the heart. Playing mind games may make you feel in control or mysterious, but it actually jeopardizes the health of your bond with the other person. It also undermines trust.


Resist the urge to score points or win favor and instead go for the truth. It can be hard at first, but recognize that vulnerability is an essential component in a successful relationship.
Put simply, if you care for someone, have the courage to tell them. If you have a problem, don’t just withdraw. Try to work it out by candidly sharing your feelings with your partner. And, if you are no longer interested in someone, be kind enough to tell them face-to-face—before you move on to the next person., A big part of being an emotionally mature man or woman is personal accountability. Be accountable to yourself and to others. If you make a promise to someone, follow through with it. If you set a goal, make a daily effort towards reaching it. Personal accountability allows you to be a person of integrity. When people can depend on you to do what you say, they are able to trust you.


The next time you say “yes” to a favor or make a promise, do whatever is necessary to see it through. If you realize down the road that you shouldn’t have said “yes,” then you’ll know next time to carefully consider all requests before agreeing to them."

See if your child squints.,
Notice if your child sits too closely to the television.,
Notice if your child covers one eye to see things better.,
Watch for other symptoms.,
Take note if your child complains of frequent headaches.,
Notice if your child’s eyes water excessively.,
See if your child crosses their eyes.,
Watch for eye rubbing.,
Discuss your child’s vision with them.,
Make things easier for your child if you think that they can't see well.,
Visit an optometrist.",How to Tell if Your Child Needs Glasses," The biggest tale tell sign that a child needs glasses is that they will squint when looking at something they can’t see clearly. If you notice your child squinting frequently, it may be time for them to get glasses.Children will squint for nearsightedness and farsightedness, so this is a good sign to look for.;
, If your child seems to inspect things too closely, this might be a sign they need glasses. Your child may sit too close to the television or hold items up in front of their face in order to see them more clearly.Lowering their head while reading (in order to get closer to the words on the page) is also a sign that your child may need glasses.

, If you notice that your child frequently closes or covers one eye while they are viewing something, this may be a sign they need glasses. This gesture helps people self-correct vision problems and children will often do it without realizing it to reduce problems with double vision.This is usually a sign of a structural ocular problem, like an astigmatism.

, There are many possible symptoms that could indicate your child needs glasses. Everyone is different and children respond to problems with their eyesight in different ways. So it’s important for you to watch out for all of the signs and symptoms, including the following:Losing their place while reading
Clumsiness
Tilting their head to look at objects

, When people have to squint a lot because they aren’t wearing glasses, this inevitably leads to frequent headaches. If your child is complaining of chronic headaches in the frontal region near their brow, this could be a sign of vision problems.Constant headache pain can lead to stress and anxiety, so you’ll need to determine the underlying cause quickly.

, Excessive tearing can be a sign of extraordinary strain on the muscles in the eyes. This can often be caused by undiagnosed vision problems. If your child seems to have watery eyes more than usual, then they may need glasses.Additionally, if your child complains of having dry eyes frequently, this could be a sign of vision problems.

, Eye crossing can be a symptom of vision problems and should be taken seriously. If you notice that your child is crossing their eyes during normal activities or at unusual times, you should consider getting their vision checked. This symptom could be caused by excessive farsightedness.Of course, this excludes silly, playful eye crossing.

, Notice if your child is rubbing their eyes often, even when they are not tired. This could be an unconscious attempt to relieve the pain or pressure they feel from straining their eyes so much to see. Difficulty seeing can cause a lot of strain on the muscles of the eyes, which can, in turn, cause watery eyes., Ask your child to describe the look of something. If they clearly describe it inaccurately (for example, they say that brown hair is black, blond hair is white, that something big is small, and so on), then they may have color blindness and/or blurry vision. Your child will probably need glasses for both diagnoses., For example, to avoid further damage, don't let them stare at a screen or even pages of a book. Get them to move around. Moving your eyes around gives the eyes a break and prevents strain.


Try to help your child improve their vision naturally.

, Once you have established your belief that your child needs glasses, the next step is to take them to the optometrist so they can have an official eye exam and get fitted for glasses.It will probably take a couple weeks after your appointment for your child’s glasses to be ready for pick up.

Feed your kids a calcium-rich diet.,
Supplement food with milk.,
Make sure children get enough Vitamin D. Another important part of bone growth is Vitamin D, which promotes the absorption of calcium in the digestive tract.,
Get moving.,
Get outside.,
Encourage healthy habits and body image.,
Test for medical problems.,
Ask about biophosphonates for juvenile osteoporosis.,
Avoid bone-weakening medicines, if possible.,
Discourage alcohol and smoking.",How to Treat Low Bone Density in Kids," Bone growth and density depends in large part on a good diet and especially on getting enough calcium. Calcium is a mineral that goes into bone as well as teeth and finger and toe nails. It’s found in many different foods, so ensure that your kids are getting the right things and the right amount of calcium.Dairy foods are rich in calcium. Choose foods like milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other cheeses several times per day for your kids.
There’s also large amounts of calcium in leafy greens like spinach and kale, in fish like salmon and sardines, in beans and tofu, and in oranges.
How much should your kids get per day? It depends. Infants need about 200 to 260 milligrams per day. Toddlers aged 1 to 3 need about 700 mgs, while children aged 4 to 8 need 1,000 mgs and kids from 9 to 19 1,300 mgs.
Kids and teens will need several servings of calcium-rich food per day to meet the minimum. For example, an 8 oz. portion of plain yogurt has about 300 mgs of calcium. A half cup of raw kale has about 90 mgs.;
, Milk is one of the best foods that your kids can consume for calcium. Each 8 oz. glass of milk contains between 280 to 300 mgs of calcium, which is a big part of the daily recommended amount. It doesn’t have to be just a beverage, either. You can add milk to other foods like oatmeal and soup instead of water, to cold cereal, or to a fruit smoothie. Be creative!Some kids have trouble digesting milk because of lactose intolerance, which can give them gas, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and nausea. Consider lactose-free milk if this is a problem. You can also buy digestive tablets like Lactaid or try to mix small amounts of milk in with food. These should all help symptoms.
If your child is allergic to dairy products, it will be a little harder for him or her to get enough calcium. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist if you are having trouble getting enough calcium in your child's diet. Your doctor or nutritionist may recommend supplements to fill in any gaps in your child's diet.
Encourage your children to drink milk or calcium-fortified orange juice rather than less healthy options like soft drinks. This is particular important for teen girls. Studies show that teens who drink soda get much less calcium than they should.
If taste is a problem, try giving kids chocolate milk or hot cocoa with milk or an occasional flavored milk like strawberry. Just be aware that flavored milks usually have more sugar and calories than regular milk.
Dispel the idea that milk is a “fattening” drink, too. Try nonfat skim milk or low fat varieties if your children raise this concern.

, This means that Vitamin D helps your body take in and use calcium better and more efficiently. Without it, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen.You can only get Vitamin D in a few ways: through some foods like fish and fish oil and in small amounts in egg yolks, beef liver, and cheese. Your body also naturally produces Vitamin D when you are exposed to sunlight. Some foods that do not naturally contain vitamin D are also fortified with vitamin D.
Take a mixed approach to Vitamin D. Try to add the few foods that contain it into your diet, including periodic servings of fish like salmon. Also try Vitamin D fortified foods. Milk, orange juice, and breakfast cereal are often enriched with extra Vitamin D.
With parents more and more limiting kids’ exposure to sunlight, you may need to consider Vitamin D supplements. Using sunscreen 100% of the time also blocks vitamin D production. The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends supplements for infants, children, and adolescents, including kids who are breastfed. Any chewable multi-vitamin with 400 International Units (IU) of Vitamin D is good.

, Physical activity helps to increase your child’s bone density. Like muscles, bones get stronger when we use them and get weaker when we don’t. Any activity is great, but the best are weight-bearing exercises that will put mild stress on the bones and cause the body to strengthen them. Keep in mind that not all activities are created equal for this – some are better than others.Encourage kids to run, jump, and climb. These are great weight-bearing exercises. Others include walking, dancing, hiking, basketball, gymnastics, hockey, soccer, skiing, and others.
Try not to let your kids be too sedentary. Limit their time watching television, using the computer or other electronic devices, and sitting indoors.
Encourage kids who aren’t walking yet to play actively on the floor. Kids who can walk should ideally be active for at least 3 hours, spread throughout the day. Older kids (5 to 18) should aim for at least one hour per day of moderate-intensity activity, along with vigorous-intensity exercise three times per week.

, As said, Vitamin D is an essential element of healthy bone development and comes in large part through exposure to natural sunlight. Kids who play and spend time outdoors will get more of this vitamin than those who spend more time inside. While we know that too much sun is a bad thing, limited sun exposure for older children and teens will ensure that they get enough Vitamin D.Exposure to sunlight for between 5 to 30 minutes between 10 am and 3 pm, twice per week on the face, arms, legs, and back should lead to significant Vitamin D synthesis.
However, it’s best to limit overall exposure to the sun and other sources of ultra violet radiation. While sunscreen over SPF 8 will reduce Vitamin D synthesis, the American Academy of Dermatology advises that you should always use it and other photo-protective steps when in the sun. Children should also not use tanning beds. However, about 10 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen three times per week may help your child's body to produce Vitamin D safely.
Diet, body weight, and Vitamin D may all be linked, as well. Higher rates of Vitamin D deficiency may be related to growing levels of childhood obesity, as the vitamin is fat soluble and may get trapped in the body’s fat cells rather than functioning normally.

, Good nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight are keys for developing bone density and strength, as well. Children should not diet. One big concern for teen girls as well as boys is the development of unhealthy habits and body image, dieting, restricting calories, and over-exercising and training. These behaviors may point to a risk of an eating disorder.

Teens who develop anorexia have much weaker bones. In girls, one sign of anorexia is missed or infrequent periods – this indicates low levels of estrogen, which is an essential hormone for bone growth.
Bone fractures are often one of the first signs of anorexia. Teen girls with anorexia are also at a much higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures later in life. In severe cases, this damage can’t be reversed.
Look for signs and talk to a doctor if you think your child may be struggling with an eating disorder. Symptoms include extreme thinness or unhealthy appearance, missed periods, rapid weight loss, preoccupation with thinness, eating infrequently or not in front of others, trips to the bathroom after meals.

, Bone density can be affected by other factors apart from diet and lifestyle. In fact, there are some medical problems that can lead to low bone density or even osteoporosis in kids if left unchecked. These include hormone deficiencies, metabolic problems, kidney diseases, bowel malabsorption disorders like celiac disease, and others.Children with low bone density can get tested by a doctor. The doctor will screen the levels of Vitamin D, serum calcium, hormones involved in bone growth, and alkaline phosphatase, which the body uses in the mineralization of bone.
Doctors can also test your kids’ bone mass with a special kind of x-ray called dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA takes an image using two x-ray beams of different energy directed, in children, at the spine.

, If your child has osteoporosis, then medicines called biophosphonates may help. These FDA approved drugs are prescribed to adults with osteoporosis and they have been tried with children as well.Talk to your doctor about medication options if your child has osteoporosis., Doctors now know that certain medicines interfere with how the intestines absorb calcium and can decrease the amount the body uses for bone growth. Kids who take these medicines may not be getting enough calcium for good bone density. Such medicines include corticosteroids, which treat asthma, and many other disorders, some medicines that treat seizures, and perhaps stimulants used to treat Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder.These medications can stop the body from correctly using calcium in food and dietary supplements, but also increase calcium loss from the kidneys and lead to lower bone density. Talk to a doctor about these possible side effects and how to make sure your child’s bones are healthy.
Make sure that an asthmatic child gets enough calcium, if she needs corticosteroids, and know that the idea that dairy products can trigger asthma attacks is not true, unless your child is allergic to dairy. Encourage your child to play and exercise safely to build bone density further. Your child may be able to exercise more comfortably in an air-conditioned space like a school gym.

, Smoking and drinking too much can also have a bad effect on your child’s (or more likely teen’s) bone density. Both of these behaviors are completely avoidable and associated with a higher risk for breaks, osteoporosis, and weaker bones. Talk to you kids and discourage them from doing either.Chronic alcohol use can lead to lower bone strength and density. In fact, between 28% to 52% of alcoholics have osteoporosis. This in part is because of poor nutrition.
We don’t know how and why, but smoking is also directly related to lower bone density. The decrease may be from smoking itself or from other factors – smokers tend to be thinner, less active, more likely to drink, and have poorer diets.
Talk to your kids and teens about the dangers of smoking. While there are many other reasons to avoid smoking, smokers have a greater risk of breaks as they age, take longer to heal, and have lower overall bone density.

, Don't throw away the wrapper--it's perfect for wrapping up and disposing of your pad when you change it later., There's usually a long piece of wax-like paper covering the adhesive on the bottom of the pad. The wrapper may also double as backing, so the adhesive will already be exposed., Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear.


If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad his hugging your underwear.Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back--it should be centered in your underwear.

, It may feel uncomfortable at first (kind of like a diaper), so walk around the bathroom to get used to the feel. You should change your pad every 3-4 hours (or sooner if you have a really heavy flow). Changing your pad will help keep it from leaking and keep you feeling fresh.

, If you're in a public place, look for a small trashcan on the floor or attached to the wall of the stall. Discard the soiled pad in the trash--never, ever throw it in the toilet, even if the packaging says it is okay to do so. It will clog the plumbing.


If you are at home and you have pets, you may want to throw the used pad into a trashcan with a lid or even the trash bin that the garbage men collect.

, It can be intimidating or overwhelming for a young girl to have a big talk about something so important. Try starting individual conversations with these topics:“Inside a girl’s body are parts that help her grow a baby.”
“Women's bodies work on cycle called the menstrual cycle which takes about 28 days.”
""A woman's body takes the steps to grow a baby each month, even when she isn't ready to have a baby yet. This causes a woman to have a period that causes her to bleed.""
“Even though a period causes bleeding, there are ways to keep clean during your period.

Buy supplies.,
Store pads in your backpack, purse, gym bag, and locker for emergencies.,
Notice changes in your body that might indicate your period is coming soon.",How to Survive Your First Period2," The more informed you are, the more likely you'll be able to stay calm when it happens. Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. It may appear as bright red drops in your underwear, or it could be brownish and sticky.Don't worry that you will be gushing blood, either--during an average period, a woman will only lose about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood.That's about the same amount of liquid as 2 bottles of nail polish.


Talk to your mom or older sister. She may be able to give you an idea of when you will get your period. It's not always the same, but often girls begin their periods around the age as their mother or sisters did.If you can't talk to a mom or older sister, talk to a school nurse or trusted friend who has already gotten her period.
When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all.If you have a blood phobia and you're worried about how you'll react, try thinking of it this way: this isn't blood like from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy., The drugstore or grocery store usually has an entire aisle dedicated to feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, pantyliners). Don't be overwhelmed by all the choices--as you get to know your flow, you'll have a better idea of which product works best for you. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky or noticeable and has light or medium absorbency..


Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with--you'll have enough to think about without worrying about how to properly insert a tampon.
Practice putting a pad in your underwear before you have your period. If you notice discharge in your underwear, use that to figure out where the middle of the pad should be.Some websites offer coupons or even free samples or period ""starter kits"" for you to keep on-hand.
If you'd rather use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that's completely fine. It's important that you are comfortable with whichever protection you choose.If you're embarrassed about buying pads, just go up to the register with a few other items, and busy yourself looking at candy while the cashier rings you up. Remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to him or her.

, With all the time you spend at school, playing sports, going to friend's houses, and doing other activities, it's possible, even likely, you will get your period while you are away from home. It may give you peace of mind to know you always have a pad with you wherever you are, just in case.If you're worried about someone going through your book bag and finding your stash or things falling out, get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies.
You may want to hide a pair of underwear and a resealable plastic bag in your locker in case you get your period at school and need to change your panties. You can rinse the soiled pair in cold water and put them in the bag to take home.
You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over the counter pain medication in your locker, just in case you get cramps. Just make sure your school policy allows this so you don't get in trouble.

, While there's no single indication that your period is arriving--you won't really know until it comes--your body may give you signs that it is preparing to menstruate. A stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, or sore breasts can all be signs that you are getting your period.Women can get their first periods as early as eight and as old as 16. Most usually get theirs around the age of 11 or 12.Women usually get their periods about two years after they begin developing breasts.You may notice a thick, white discharge in your underpants up to 6 months before getting your first period.Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds (7 stone).If you are underweight, this may delay your period.

The nurse can give you pain medicine, a heating pad, and a place to rest until you feel better.Exercise can actually relieve cramps. Even if you don't feel like moving, try not to skip gym class. It might help you feel better.
Try a few yoga poses to relieve cramps. Start with child's pose. Sit on your knees so your butt is resting on your heels. Stretch the upper half of your body forward, arms extended, until your stomach is resting on your thighs. Breathe slowly and relax, closing your eyes.Chamomile tea contains an anti-inflammatory that can help with cramps.Drink warm water to stay hydrated and reduce bloating and cramps., While you may not delight at the idea of sharing this information with your mom or dad, it's important they know. They can help you get supplies and take you to the doctor if you have any concerns or feel that something is wrong. If you have an irregular period, severe cramps, or acne, birth control might help get your hormones in check, and you'll need to see a doctor to get the prescription.Even if it's awkward, your parents will be happy you told them. They love and care about you, and your health is important to them.
If it's just you and your dad, don't keep him in the dark. He knows you're going to get your period eventually. Even if he doesn't have all the answers, he can help you get supplies, and may put you in touch with an aunt or other trustworthy woman you can talk to.
If you still feel shy, try sending your mom a text or writing a note so you don't have to talk face-to-face., While your period will probably be very irregular at first--it may last two days or nine, it may come every 28 days or twice a month--it's important you start to track it.Your doctor will start asking you about your cycle, and talk to you about any concerns you may have about the length, amount of flow, or time between your periods.


You can use one of many smart phone apps to track your period.
Tracking your period will make it less likely you are caught unaware. You can wear a panty liner when you know you're getting near the time of your period.
Knowing when you can expect your period can come in handy when making plans (you might want to postpone that beach trip for the week after your period).

Be calm and comforting.,
Describe why a period occurs.,
Discuss the options for hygiene during a period.,
Describe the physical symptoms that may accompany a period.,
Explain the link between menstruation and pregnancy.,
Celebrate with your daughter.",How to Talk to Your Daughter About Her Period2," The most important thing to remember when talking to your daughter about her period is to stay relaxed and encourage her to ask any questions she might have. Remember to keep the conversation positive and encourage her throughout the process. These phrases may help you get the conversation started:


""Your body is doing what it is supposed to be doing!""
""This is perfectly normal, and every woman goes through this.""
""I am here to support you, and I understand what you are going through.""

, Explain what happens with the internal female anatomy during a period. Highlight the steps below to help her fully understand what is happening with her body.The menstrual cycle takes 28 days and is started by a change in hormone levels in a woman’s body.
The hormones trigger a woman’s body to release an egg cell from the ovaries in the process of “ovulation.”
If the egg is unfertilized, it breaks down on its journey through the fallopian tubes into the uterus due to a drop in hormone levels.
The egg and lining of uterus are shed from the body in the process of menstruation along with blood from the wall of the uterus.

, In most cases a pad is the best option for girls when they first begin having their period until they fully understand their cycle.Tampons can also be used; however, attention must be paid to the absorbency of the tampons and the relative blood flow during a menstrual cycle. It is important to educate your daughter on the use of pads and tampons as well as and to ensure that she knows to change her tampon at least every four hours. It is usually best to use a pad overnight., Although you don’t want to focus on the uncomfortable symptoms of a period, you should inform your daughter that periods do cause the uterus to contract which sometimes can cause cramps which feel like a dull aching pain in their lower abdomen or back., Due to fluctuating hormone levels in a woman’s body, the menstrual cycle causes the body to undergo changes which create the possibility of pregnancy when engaging in sexual activity. Make sure she understands this possibility to avoid future situations for which she isn’t prepared.Use these prompts to broach the subject:


""Because you have begun having your period, it is now possible for you to become pregnant.""
It's important that you know that you can get pregnant by having unprotected sex.

, Make her feel comfortable and do something special to let her know that you support her and understand what she is going through. Going out for dinner, baking a cake together, or going to a special event are all ways you can commemorate the occasion and let your daughter know that you are there to support her!

Be prepared.,
Teach her how to use these products.,
Get some acne products.,
Get her some bras.,
Get her deodorant.,
Maybe, if you wish, get her a razor.",How to Prepare a Preteen Girl for Puberty Changes," She will/may be starting her period soon so you need to have the products for it. Pads and/or pantyliners are your best bet for her first few periods.;
, Make sure she knows where these products go, when to change them, and overall how to use them.

, Some moisturizers and cleansers for her face. Teach her how to wash her face well without drying her face out. Try to get her in a habit of using these products.

, She is growing up and she might want a bra herself, but is embarrassed to ask. This gives her an open door to get one. Make sure to get one that fits and maybe help her the first time she wears one to school, or until she gets the hang of it. This doesn't mean dress her like you did when she was younger, just help her latch it up in the back and tighten the straps if they fall or loosen them if they are to tight.

, She may not understand, she may think she smells ""fine."" But she is going to need deodorant because she is going to get a lot sweatier these days.

, If you feel she may need it then at least try it, she may have underarm hair and hairy legs but not know what to do and be embarrassed to do things with her friends like swimming or anything where you wear shorts! Don't hold her back, get her a razor and teach her how to use it, when to use it, how much shaving cream to use, etc.

Understand your daughter’s concerns and fears.,
Help educate your daughter about her menstrual cycle.,
Discuss the mechanics of the menstrual cycle to your daughter.,
Avoid having “The Talk.” While it may seem like a good idea to have “The Talk,” in reality, conversations about your daughter’s menstrual cycle should be ongoing.,
Try not to focus too much on the downside of having a period.,
Talk to your daughter about sexual intercourse.,
Explain to your daughter how to use a sanitary pad.,
Talk to your daughter about tampons.,
Teach your daughter how to track her period.,
Inform your daughter about keeping clean.,
Teach your daughter that it’s important to change her pad or tampon often.,
Create a period kit.,
Arrange for a trusted adult to help.,
Take your daughter to see her doctor.",How to Prepare Your Daughter for Her First Period," Getting your first period is a scary and exciting event. Your daughter will likely have a number of questions about what it will be like and what she should do. If you are a woman, you should be able to answer based on your personal experience, including what it was like to have your first period when you were younger. If you’re a man, you’ll need to decide if you want to answer these questions yourself, or if you’d like to enlist the help of a woman to answer the questions for your daughter.For men, keep in mind that while you may want to be supportive of your daughter, she may be uncomfortable talking to you about her period. The best approach is to ask her specifically what she’d prefer. She may have a specific female she’d like to speak with that you can help arrange.;
, There are so many great resources that both you and your daughter can use to learn more about a woman’s menstrual cycle. For example, there are many books written specifically for girls your daughter’s age about getting a period. You may want to review these resources in advance to make sure they’re providing accurate and up-to-date information, and that they don’t contain any information you do not want your daughter to read.Besides searching online for possible books, check out your local library and ask your librarian for suggestions. You can also contact your daughter’s doctor to see if they have any resources they’d recommend.
An example of a great website that could be used to help explain the menstrual cycle is KidsHealth.org.Search YouTube and other websites for well-done, educational, and accurate videos about menstruation that may be useful to show your daughter.If you’re daughter asks you a question about menstruation that you don’t know the answer to, say so. And then promise to find the answer and get back to her.
It might be useful to know when your daughter will be having health or sex education classes at school so you can follow-up with additional conversations at home. If you can, speak to her teacher and ask for the material to be used so you’re prepared for any questions she may have.

, Going through the physiological details of what happens when your daughter has her period can be a great way for her to better understand how her body is functioning. This conversation should also include discussing myths or rumours she may have heard and helping her sort out what is true and what isn’t. This explanation may be more successful if you use diagrams of the female reproductive system so your daughter can visualize what’s actually happening.Be sure to include an explanation that your daughter’s menstrual cycle lasts around 28 days. And that while she may have her period for only a week or so within those 28 days, there’s still plenty of other activities happening in her body before and after her period.
Explaining the 28 day cycle may also be a good time to explain that her period won’t be the same every single day that she has it. It may start out very light, then get heavier, then lighten up again near the end. You could use this opportunity to explain that there are difference feminine hygiene products available for different days of her period, if she needs them.
This discussion is also a great time to explain that no two girls or women are the same when it comes to their periods. She may experience something completely different from her friends or sisters, and not to use that difference to think something is wrong with her.

, Your daughter should know that she can talk to you about the topic anytime she wants to, not just during a special talk. Therefore it’s better to have lots of smaller conversations about her body over time, starting early. Plus, trying to inform your daughter about everything she needs to know in only one conversation can be overwhelming. It will be easier for her to remember the information if you talk about it multiple times.Any talks about your daughter’s body should start when she’s really young. Any time she asks a question about her body, or the human body in general, you should talk openly with her and answer honestly.
It’s also important that you ensure your daughter has the correct information, and not rumours or myths that might be discussed amongst her friends.
Look for various ways to segue into a conversation about menstruation, such as: commercials for female hygiene products, walking down the aisle with female hygiene products, a scene in a movie or TV show, etc.

, Most women will know that getting your period brings a lot of other issues such as bloating, irritability, cramps, etc. However, your daughter doesn’t need to know all the terrible details in advance. Instead, explain some of the common symptoms she may experience and explain how she can help alleviate them (e.g. heating pad, ibuprofen, etc.).Keep in mind that not all girls will experience the same symptoms, and they may not all experience those symptoms right away. Explaining every possible negative aspect of a period may only cause additional fears and worries that are unnecessary.
Always try to keep conversations about menstruation as positive as possible.

, Technically speaking, girls can get pregnant even before their first period. Before her first period, an egg will be released from her ovaries and make its way down to her uterus. Anytime between when the egg is released until her period begins, she could technically get pregnant. Not only is it important that she understand this, but also that once she has her period, becoming pregnant from sexual intercourse is a definite possibility.How you go about having such a conversation is up to you, based on your personal beliefs.
You may want to take the time to explain what protection is available (i.e. condoms, birth control, etc.) and how effective each type can typically be.
You may want to explain that having sexual intercourse can also lead to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) which can cause short and long-term health problems.
This type of conversation might work well when your daughter is also being taught similar topics in a health or sex ed class.

, Prepare your daughter with instructions on how to use a sanitary pad. Explain or show her how it gets attached to underwear, and what to do with used pads. Also ensure your daughter realizes she should change her pad every 4 to 6 hours at the very least, but can change it anytime she wants. Before her first period, you should have your daughter try out a pad by putting it on and taking it off, just so she’s use to it when the time comes.Make sure your daughter understands that pads cannot be flushed in a toilet, but instead that they should be disposed of in the special receptacle in a bathroom stall. She’s probably already seen these receptacles, so it should be easy to explain what they look like.

, Using a tampon for her first period is probably not a good idea, simply because the situation will be overwhelming enough without needing to figure out how to use a tampon. After her first period, or even after her first few periods, talk to your daughter to determine if she’s interested in using tampons. If she is, show her diagrams of how to use tampons to help your verbal explanation make sense.You could also show your daughter some YouTube videos on tampon use, created by young girls. Seeing other young girls properly explain tampon use may make it less scary to try.
Make sure to alleviate any fears of a tampon being “lost” inside your daughter’s body by explaining that anatomically-speaking, a tampon has no where to go. Use a diagram if it helps.
Be sure to explain that a tampon should be changed every 4 hours. If she’s unable to change a tampon every 4 hours (for example, if she’s concerned about using tampons at school), suggest she use sanitary pads while away from home.

, Explain that a full menstrual cycle lasts from day 1 of one period until day 1 of the next period, which is also usually 28 days in length. This means she can mark the first day of her period on a calendar and then count forward 28 days. She can mark on the calendar the 28th day so she knows that her next period should come somewhere around that day. Ensure she realizes that not all periods follow this cycle precisely, so it could start before or after this date as well.Some women experience cycles that are only 22 days long, or as long as 45 days. These differences are normal and are nothing for you or your daughter to be worried about.
Let your daughter know that if she tracks her period via a calendar, she may be able to notice a pattern that’s specific to her. Knowing if she has a specific cycle length will help her predict when her next period will begin.

, Explain to your daughter that once she gets her period it’ll be a good idea to have a shower everyday and pay extra attention to cleaning her labia. Although, you also need to let her know that no special products or soap are required to clean her labia, all she needs is the warm water from a shower.Having a bath is actually the best method for cleaning during a period. Not only does it clean well, it can help alleviate cramps or pains.

, Your daughter should know that there’s no such thing as changing your pad or tampon too often. However, she should at least change her pad every 4 to 6 hours and her tampon every 4 hours. Explain that leaving a pad on for too long can cause problems due to the dampness being close to her skin for too long. Also explain that leaving a tampon in for too long can result in Toxic Shock Syndrome. The purpose isn’t to scare your daughter, but just to give her good, educated reasons why she needs to make sure she changes her pad or tampon regularly., Because it’s difficult to predict when your daughter will have her first period, one thing you can help your daughter with is to create a period kit. Having such a kit will help make her feel more comfortable that she’s ready whenever or wherever it may happen. Your daughter can keep this kit with her at all times, in her purse or backpack.A period kit should include a couple teen-sized sanitary pads and a clean pair of underwear. You may also want to include a plastic baggie of wipes so she can clean herself if needed.
While she may eventually want to try tampons, putting tampons in her kit is probably not a good idea since she might be uncomfortable using them right away. You can add them to her period kit later, when she’s use to them.
Tell your daughter not to worry if a pair of underwear is ruined, and that she can feel free to throw them out. If she’s concerned about her clothes being stained, help her keep a spare pair of pants in her locker or backpack to help make her more comfortable.

, Since there’s a good chance you daughter will get her first period while at school or at an extracurricular activity, speak to her about having a trusted adult she could go to if she needed help. This person may be a teacher, a school nurse or counsellor, a coach, or even an older student. Explain to your daughter that all women understand what it’s like to not only get a first period, but what it’s like to get a period suddenly and unexpectedly, and that there’s no need to be afraid to ask another woman for help.Also explain to your daughter that she should help other girls who might be having period troubles. For example, if she notices a friend who may be leaking, she should feel comfortable enough to tell that friend.

, Once your daughter starts her period, her doctor should be informed at the next visit. However, there’s no need to visit the doctor specifically because her period has started, unless she has a problem. If you daughter experiences any issues, such as those listed below, make an appointment to see her doctor and have the doctor assess the issue.Your daughter has pain when a tampon is being inserted.
Your daughter has a period that comes more often than every 21 days or less often than every 45 days.
Your daughter has a period that lasts longer than 7 days.
Your daughter has bleeding between periods.
Your daughter experiences heavy periods or cramps that cannot be alleviated by regular, over-the-counter medications.
Your daughter is 15 years of age and has not yet had her first period.
Your daughter has shown significant signs of puberty for 3 years but has not yet had her first period.

Pay attention to your body as you approach puberty.,
Notice if you’re experiencing mood swings.,
Wash your face twice daily to reduce acne.,
Watch for hair in your pubic area and expect more body hair in general.,
Get ready for growth spurts.,
Talk to adults that you respect and feel comfortable around.",How to Know You Are in Puberty1," Puberty brings about many changes physically and mentally, as well as emotionally. Your body goes through hormonal changes, and you will notice your body slowly changing from a child’s body into an adult’s body. If you’re wondering whether you’re becoming a teenager yet, just look at your body!


Most boys begin puberty between ages nine and 15, while most girls begin earlier: between ages eight and 13.You might feel awkward or embarrassed at first, but this is a natural process, and you will eventually become comfortable with your body.;
, Your brain and hormones are going through puberty along with your physical body, and they will experience changes as well. Expect an occasional mood swing: one minute you’ll feel happy, then you’ll feel angry or sad, and then happy again. This is typical; your body is going through hormonal changes and this is how your brain manages all the mental and physical changes of puberty.


This is a common first step as you approach puberty. If you notice yourself experiencing frequent mood swings, puberty is just around the corner.
If you notice an increase in negative thoughts or are occupied with thoughts of harming yourself or others, talk to your parents or to your school counselor as soon as possible.

, During puberty, hormonal changes going on in your body will stimulate oil glands under the surface of your skin. This will make your skin feel more greasy, as more oil is pushed to the surface.As a result, outbreaks of pimples are likely to increase, especially if you have poor facial hygiene. To help prevent serious acne:


Wash your face with lukewarm water and a gentle facial cleanser twice a day to keep the pimples from showing up and getting bigger.
Drink more water so that your body can flush out toxins.
Acne can also be genetic. If you start noticing an increase in pimples, ask your parents if they suffered from many outbreaks during puberty. You may wish to see a dermatologist for additional skin care., Hair will start to grow in your groin, just like under your armpits. In fact, hair will often start to grow in both places around the same time — early in puberty, often around age nine.Pubic hair and body hair growth are signs that you have definitely entered puberty. While mood swings, acne, and other hormonal developments precede or lead into your pubescence, body hair growth and upcoming growth spurts are sure signs to help you know that you have entered puberty.

, For both young men and young women, puberty brings about frequent growth spurts as your body grows into that of an adult.While growth can occasionally be physically painful, a larger concern — especially for parents — is that you will quickly outgrow your clothes and shoes until your growth spurts have stopped.


Since everyone begins puberty at different times, some young men and women will begin their growth spurts before their peers. This is normal, even if it’s sometimes a little socially awkward.
Young women will notice their hips becoming wider and will begin to develop breasts.Young men will notice their shoulders becoming broader and their chests filling out., When you feel concerned, embarrassed, or insecure about your puberty, talk to someone about it. Try to talk about it with your mother, father, family members, or another adult you trust. Remember, they’ve all been through it.


It’s also a good idea to visit your doctor yearly while you are going through puberty. He will make sure you are healthy and can answer any questions you may have.

Talk to women who have had their first period.,
Investigate beyond your personal circle.",How to Plan for Your First Period," Most girls use pads during their first period. Pads are easy to use because they do not involve inserting anything into the vagina (tampons and menstrual cups require some extra practice). There are many types of pads. They range in thickness, size, and shape. You may want to buy a few different types and practice using them before your period to see what feels most comfortable for you.You’ll also want to have pads on hand before you get your period just in case you don’t have time to go to the store when your period comes.


Pads are made of soft, absorbent material that covers the panty area just below the vagina. The pad sticks to your underwear and absorbs the blood from your period. You’ll be able to see how much you are bleeding, and determine if it needs to be changed. No matter how light your flow is, pads should be changed every three to four hours to avoid buildup of bacteria and foul smells.;
, Tampons are small, tubular, absorbent and have a string at the end. They go inside the vagina and absorb blood. Unlike pads, tampons cannot be checked for the amount of blood they carry. They should be changed every two to four hours and used no longer than eight hours at a time. Many women use tampons with panty liners (a very thin pad) for extra protection in case the tampon leaks. Athletic girls tend to prefer tampons since they do not inhibit movement and can be worn while swimming.It may take some time to learn how to insert a tampon properly. Be patient with yourself as it can take anywhere from a few months to a few years to get comfortable with tampons.

, You may not want to overwhelm yourself with options for your first period. However, there are ways to take care of your period apart from using pads and tampons. Menstrual cups and period panties, among others, are also ways to take care of your period. All have pros and cons, so it is up to you to decide what works best for your body.


Consider menstrual cups. Menstrual cups are small, flexible cups that are inserted into the vagina. Some cups are for one-time use, and others are reusable. They are often made of silicone or rubber.Menstrual cups are emptied and rinsed as needed, and can be used for up to 12 hours.Cups do not inhibit physical movement and can be worn while swimming. Cups can also take some getting used to. It can take a few cycles for women to use cups properly.
Consider period panties. Period panties are like regular panties, but they are made especially to use when you are menstruating. The material is highly absorbent and can be worn as backup for tampons or cups, or they can be worn on their own. Panties vary in their capacity for absorbency, so you’ll have to find ones that match your flow. Period panties come in many styles and can be washed and reused., You won’t know the exact day or time that you will get your first period. Fill a small toiletry bag with several pads and an extra set of underwear in case you need to change. Carry your period bag with you every day.Consider adding a painkiller to the bag. Some women experience cramps, or pain in the lower back and abdomen, during a period. Read the directions on the packaging and do not take more than is recommended.A hot water bottle or heating pad on the lower belly also help relieve cramps.
Have a backup plan. If you get your period and you don’t have a pad, you can wrap toilet paper around your panties to catch the blood. Try asking a friend or a nearby woman for pads. Most women are very willing to help. Wrap a sweater around your waist if you are worried about visible leaks.

, Light, brownish discharge is called spotting. It may occur at the beginning (and end) of your period. You may feel the discharge in your underwear or see it on the toilet paper after using the bathroom., PMS refers to a series of symptoms a woman might feel before getting her period. Signs of PMS can appear up to two weeks before your period. You’ll have to pay special attention to your body and mood to recognize signs of PMS.


Be aware of sensitivity around your body. Some women feel swollen or tender breasts before a period. Feeling bloated or full in the lower abdomen is also common. This can occur before, during, or after your period. You may feel these physical symptoms or none at all. You will start to notice such changes in your body after several cycles.Notice changes on your face. Sometimes women notice more pimples on the face before a period. This is a normal sign of changing hormones. All bodies are different, so you may or may not experience breakouts before a period.Notice changes in your mood. Some women feel that they are more sad and emotional before their periods. You may feel more likely to cry or have other mood swings as a result of changing hormones., You may or may not feel symptoms of PMS, especially before your first period. If you do feel physical pains like tenderness, headaches, or bloating, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to ease the discomfort. Hormonal birth control can also help with symptoms like acne and painful cramps during your period.Severe PMS may be a sign of a more serious condition called Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). Talk to your doctor if you have severe mood swings, depression, insomnia, or panic attacks before your period. , When young women reach puberty, blood and tissue are released from the uterus through the vagina. Bleeding lasts about three to seven days, but periods can be longer or shorter, especially in the first few years. Most women get their periods every 28 days, but this tends to vary in the beginning.It may seem like a lot of blood, but women only lose between one and six tablespoons of blood each menstrual cycle. Your first period will probably be on the lighter side.Even so, you will have to use something to absorb the blood and keep it from staining your clothes.


Know the age range for getting your period. Young women usually get their first period between the ages of nine and 15.
Know what to look for. Period blood ranges in color and consistency. It may look red, dark brown, or black. Clumps of tissue may also appear in the blood. This is normal., Beginning menstruation is a sign that your body has the capacity to become pregnant. Each month, your ovaries release an egg that travels through your fallopian tubes, toward your uterus. Your uterus forms a soft lining of blood and tissue in preparation for the egg to become fertilized by a sperm and eventually grow into a baby. An egg is only fertilized by coming in contact with sperm. This usually happens through vaginal sex, although there are other ways for sperm to enter a vagina and fertilize an egg. If the egg is not fertilized by a sperm, your uterus then releases the lining of blood and tissue. That blood and tissue is your period.Women who are sexually active should closely monitor their menstrual cycle. A missed period could be a sign of pregnancy.

, If possible, ask your mom and other family members about their first period. If they are biologically related to you, it may give you a sense of the age at which you might start menstruating.Other women can tell you personal stories and details about what to expect. Try talking to a trusted family member, friend, or adult at school. A school nurse or counselor should be willing to discuss the ins and outs of your period with you.


For example, if you want to talk to a woman about her first period, try saying, “Hey Layla, I’ve been thinking about when I might get my first period, and I was wondering what it was like for you.”
Approach your school nurse or guidance counselor with your questions. Try saying, “Hi Ms. Green, I have some questions about getting my period. Can I talk to you for a minute?”

, Do some research about first-time period experiences. There are many websites that are geared towards young women’s health. You can read other girls’ stories and get a sense of what the first few periods might be like.


Good websites give a wide variety of information about sexual and reproductive health, including the risks and benefits of common practices. Websites like girlshealth.gov and plannedparenthood.org have comprehensive information about menstruation.

Get a large box.,
Consider what to put into the kit.,
Stock the kit.,
Introduce the kit.,
Keep the lines of communication open.",How to Make a Puberty Kit for Your Daughter1," The idea of the home kit is that it will contain a wide variety of items relevant to your daughter’s puberty experience. Because of that, the kit is going to be substantially larger than the on-the-go kit, which focuses mostly on her period. Consider anything from a shoebox size to a large packing book box. But you should alter the box to adapt it to its new use:


Make it look attractive and inviting by decorating it.
Decorate the inside, with tissue paper or other materials.
Do not write “Puberty Kit” on the box – this might cause embarrassment with friends, siblings, or family members.;
, The kit should prepare your daughter for a much wider range of puberty-related experiences than the on-the-go kit. You should include a variety of toiletries, personal hygiene items, and informational material. If you have space, also include beauty supply items or other things that might make your daughter feel less awkward or embarrassed about puberty. Try to make her feel excited about this life change.

, Go out and gather all the items you think your daughter might need. It is best to not buy too much at one time, as your daughter might wind up not liking certain brands or certain types of products. Consider a variety of products, such as different deodorants, razors, or types of pads or tampons. Include the following and more:


Bras (try training and sports bras first).
Antiperspirant deodorant.
Scented body spray.
Gentle face cleanser and an acne spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide.
Razors specifically made for girls or women.
Shave gel.
Pads and panty liners.
Tampons—start with ""light"" or ""slender"" and ""regular"" sizes.
Hand sanitizer.
A calendar to track her monthly cycle.
An informative book about menstruation.
An all about a girl's body book.

, You then need to give your daughter the kit. It is best that you do this in the context of a talk about puberty. Also try not to act embarrassed. Your daughter should feel comfortable with the kit, as it just aids her through a normal part of life. Make sure to explain the need for all of the items in the kit. Remember, this is an opportunity for you and your daughter to bond, and for you to share your life experience with her and to prepare her for the exciting time before her!

, Communication is one of the most important intangible aspects of the kit. Make sure you continually follow up with your daughter over the next weeks and months (and after, of course). Let your daughter know that she can take some time to think about the kit and get back to you if she has further questions about puberty or how to use anything in the kit.

Observe your breasts.,
Observe your armpits to see if there are any small hairs beginning to grow.,
Expect to start menstruating once you have entered puberty.",How to Know You Are in Puberty2," This is often the first sign of puberty for women: your breasts will start to grow, at first by developing a small “bump” under each nipple.Many women find that their breasts develop unevenly; one may grow more rapidly than the other. Don’t be alarmed; this is a normal part of puberty, and they’ll even out with time.


This process often causes some soreness around your developing breasts — don’t be concerned, this is normal.

, Once you’ve hit puberty, hair will start to grow under your armpits. Your armpits will produce more sweat as well, even if you’re not exercising.


Most adolescents begin wearing deodorant during puberty, to prevent any unpleasant body-odor smells that may develop. It's also important to bathe or shower daily.
Many women (and some men) begin to shave their armpit hair. This is a fine thing to do, especially if you consider this hair to be unattractive or uncomfortable.

, One of the major signs of puberty in girls is menstruation, which usually begins one to three years after you first begin puberty.If you often find little brown-reddish spots or a white or dark fluid in your underwear, be prepared for your first menstruation to begin soon.


Menstruation is a monthly process that all women experience. Each month, an egg from one of your ovaries will descend to your uterus, only to be shed along with the inner lining of your womb. The eggs and uterine lining exit through your vagina, and this process causes monthly bleeding.
It helps to have a box of sanitary pads ready in advance. If you’re uncertain about how to use them, you can ask your mom to show you. You may want to have one or two in your backpack or locker at school in case your period begins at school.
Your periods may be inconsistent or widely spaced out at first. As you age, they will happen monthly, but at first, you may only have a period once every six months."

Keep an eye on your genitals.,
Listen to your voice.,
Plan to begin having occasional more frequent erections and wet dreams.,
Expect to start growing facial hair.",How to Know You Are in Puberty3," As you enter puberty, you will notice that your testicles increase in size and physically descend.This is an important part of sexual maturation, and will often be the first sign that you notice.


As your body begins to develop and to produce more testosterone, you will begin to physically look more like a man. As part of this process, your penis will increase in size as well.

, As young men enter puberty, their voices will start to crack. This is one of the most well known signs of male puberty — over time, your voice will deepen and you will start to sound more like a man and less like a boy.Although the “cracking” in your voice can be unexpected and slightly embarrassing, it usually only lasts for a few months.
Your larynx (or “voice box”) will grow. This results in a more pronounced Adam’s apple.

, As a young man’s body goes through puberty, its sexual organs mature and began to behave in sexual ways. As you enter puberty, you’ll start to have more frequent erections — some of these will be caused by sexual stimulants, but others will simply occur for no reason.You will also begin to experience wet dreams: a sexual arousal and ejaculation while you are asleep. Not every young man has wet dreams, but if you experience them, it’s completely normal.

, For young men, facial hair will often be the last to start growing, and it will often start around the chin or upper lip. You can tell that you’re growing increased facial hair as a result of puberty when it comes in slightly darker than the very light hair you had on your face as a child.


You may not need to shave your face until sometime in high school.
Buy a razor in anticipation of shaving your face. Shaving your face can seem dangerous or difficult at first; if you’re concerned, have one of your parents show you how to shave.

Get a bag or small container.,
Consider what to put into the kit.,
Stock the kit.,
Introduce the kit.",How to Make a Puberty Kit for Your Daughter2," The portable kit is geared toward preparing your daughter, in terms of material items, for her period. The idea of the kit is that it is portable and your daughter can put it in her backpack or take it with her on an overnight to a friend’s house. You can sew a bag yourself, use a pencil case or buy a small makeup bag from a pharmacy. You could also use a zippered compartment of a school bag or purse.

, These supplies should be things that your daughter might immediately need in the event that her period comes by surprise or at an inopportune time. Not every woman has the same flow or the same needs, so it is best to over-prepare until you know the character of your daughter’s menstruation. But remember, the kit needs to be small enough to put into a backpack or overnight bag. Consider the following:


If she’s had her first period.
What products you like best.
How heavy her flow is (if she’s had her first period).

, There are a number of things you should put in the kit. These items will prepare her for most scenarios and most emergencies. Hopefully, it will give both you and your daughter the peace of mind that she'll be prepared when the time comes.


2 Pantiliners
2 Pads (add more, if you don't use tampons).
2 Tampons in different sizes (add more, if you don't use pads).
Midol or Ibuprofen for cramps.
Hand sanitizer. Explain that she should wash her hands and use soap or use sanitizer before and after taking off and applying a pad or tampon.
A small pack of tissues. If there is a shortage of toilet paper or she needs to be more discrete.
An extra pair of panties. Just in case.
A plastic bag. If she doesn’t have access to garbage, she can put her used supplies in a plastic bag and dispose of them later., Now you’ve got to sit down with her and have a discussion about the purpose and need of the kit. Explain that the kit is for emergencies and for on the go. It is better to be prepared than to be caught unprepared. Avoid embarrassing her, and reassure her that puberty and her period is a normal part of life. This discussion is best had after you’ve initiated a long-term discussion about growing up, puberty, and even sex."

The first step when going through puberty is your breasts will start to develop.

Stage 1 you have a flat chest, with a mountain shaped nipple and an areola.
Stage 2 a raised bump will appear which is called a breast. The nipple will look darker, rounder, and large and will start to hurt. Some girls feel a little tenderness if the middle part of your nipple hits a hard surface.
Stage 3 the aureola and the nipple continue to grow and be darker. At this stage the nipple might be a little pointier.
At stage 4 some girls skip this stage and go straight to stage 5 which is your breasts are fully developed and are a lot more rounder than stage 1. You might see little hairs around the aureoles don't pick or pluck at them. This can cause irritation.

;

, You may want a pad at this point.

, You should talk to an adult whom you trust and talk about getting a pad or a tampon.

,


You will also start getting pimples if you don't wash your face. You may also see pimples on your forehead maybe because you have bangs. Or if you don't, it's just there for a reason. When you do start getting pimples or acne wash your face two times a day. Use a gentle cleaning wash like Cetaphil to wash your face. Never pick at pimples or acne. If you do you, it will leave a scar.

A therapist is someone you can talk to and trust. They can help you work through problems and make changes to help your life feel more stable. A therapist can help you cope with problems, find ways to relieve stress, and can help you talk about your struggles in a safe and supporting environment.Usually you would need to see a therapist for about an hour every one to four weeks as they deem appropriate.
If you can’t seem to get your thoughts and emotions together and they’re greatly impacting your life, you may want to talk to somebody about depression or anxiety.
Your therapist won’t share information with your parents unless you tell them it’s okay or else if they think you might put yourself or others in danger. However, your parents will have to give consent for you to receive therapy, so you will need to talk with them first if you think you need to see a therapist.;
, If you have a mental health diagnosis you may benefit from taking medications. Medications are sometimes used alongside therapy to help you feel more balanced and stable. Depending on your diagnosis, your provider may prescribe something to treat your symptoms and help you feel better.You might experience some side-effects, so talk to your provider regularly in case something needs to change. Report extreme or sudden side-effects to your provider immediately.
Keep in mind that these medications don’t work right away. They take some time to work. Be sure to take your medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor and do not stop taking the medication without talking with your doctor first.

, If you’re struggling to function and make it through the day, you may need a higher level of care. Residential treatment facilities allow you to live in a center that’s much nicer than a hospital but allows you to get the care you need. You can also look into a short-term residential treatment program. You may go to a residential facility for a drug or alcohol problem, an eating disorder, or for a psychiatric problem. These facilities often include a school component so you don’t fall behind. Mostly, the focus on getting you feeling well enough to return to regular life and being able to cope well with school, friends, and family.Residential treatment might last weeks or months. Treatment usually includes seeing a therapist, psychiatrist, and other medical doctors to treat physical and emotional health problems. Therapy usually includes group and individual therapy and there are other activities as well that are intended to be therapeutic.

, If you have a mental health diagnosis and are struggling at school, you can get some assistance. For example, if you’re finding it difficult to stay on top of your homework or are stressed or frustrated, talk to your guidance counselor. They can help you with a plan to lower your stress at school and give you resources to succeed.Students with mental health problems are often protected by laws and have resources available to help them succeed. Your guidance counselor can help set up meetings to discuss what will help you most in school.

, Most people approach problems by either avoiding them or going right into problem-solving mode. Instead, practice turning toward your difficult or painful emotions and acknowledging them. This can help you respond without reacting. When you’re quick to blurt out or stomp off or say something you might regret, take a few breaths instead. Taking a couple breaths can help your brain think clearly and can stop your immediate reaction.For example, instead of saying, “I can’t believe you would say that, you’re such a jerk!” take a pause before responding. Notice if you feel defensive or hurt. Explore your own thoughts and feelings without judging them or responding to them.
Try talking with a trusted friend or family member to get some perspective and identify your feelings. It might be easier for someone on the outside of the situation to see why you are reacting in a certain way.
In some cases, sleeping on it might be the best reaction.

, Even if you feel alone and want to isolate, don’t give up on your friendships or your family. Everyone struggles with something, so you’re not the only one with a flaw. Stay engaged with social activities and meet up with friends regularly. Ask for help when you need it and be upfront with how you feel.Talk to your friends, even if you fear they might not understand you. You might be surprised by how they respond. It can be as simple as saying, “Can you talk?”
Stay involved in social activities with friends. Call friends and see what they’re up to and do activities like game nights and bowling. Don’t let your social life slip away.
If you don’t have many friends, join a club or volunteer. You can meet other teens who have similar interests as you.

, Start to notice your negative thoughts when they come up. Counter your negative thoughts with a positive one, such as, “Maybe I made a mistake, but I’ll get it right next time.” Write your positive thoughts down and say them out loud to yourself and to other people. These different ways of expressing the thought will help to solidify them in your brain. Every time you find yourself in negative thoughts, look for an opportunity to be positive and think positively. You can also enlist friends and family to help you do this. Remember that things are rarely as bad as you think they are, so maintain a positive perspective and don’t jump to conclusions.For example, if you’re feeling unstable, remember a time that you felt calm, collected, and fully stable. Think about how it felt in your body and try to feel that way in this moment.

, A journal can be one way you communicate your thoughts and feelings without having to talk about them with anybody else. It can also help you track how you feel. For example, are there certain times of day, week, or month where you feel more unstable? You can track your triggers and stressors and learn a little about what causes you to feel unstable. A journal is also a healthy way to explore your emotions such as anger, sadness, frustration, and disappointment.Get in the habit of writing in your journal every day. Set aside time in the mornings or at night to write about your day, how you feel, and what triggers you. Pay attention to what time of day works best for you. You may find that you are too tired to journal at night or that you get too emotional if you journal first thing in the morning.

, If you have a friendship that’s constantly on the rocks or someone in your life that you’re always fighting with, consider adjusting this relationship. If it’s a friend, create some distance in the friendship by texting or calling less often or spending less time together. Make some new friends that you get along with better. If it’s a family member or parent, try avoiding topics you know you’ll disagree on and act neutrally toward one another. If you know a place will cause stress or problems, stay away from it. You don’t need to walk into problems. Keep your distance.Part of being stable is creating a stable environment for yourself. Avoiding problems and stress can help you do that. However, keep in mind that you cannot eliminate all stressors. Identify the ones you can control and work on those.

, Exercise is an important part of feeling healthy, and you should aim to get 60 minutes of exercise each day.Exercise can help you strengthen your muscles and bones, control your weight, and improve your mental health and mood.If you have a hard time sticking with exercise, it’s best to focus on activities you enjoy. You can also try out different activities or invite a friend to join you to help make exercising more fun.


For example, take a dance class, karate class, or attend yoga. You can join school sports teams or other community activities.

, Most teens need between 8-10 hours of sleep each night.If you have problems falling asleep, start a bedtime routine that helps your body calm down so that it can rest peacefully. Stop eating 2-3 hours before you fall asleep. Do some relaxing activities before bedtime such as journaling, reading, or taking a bath. Turn off the TV or cellphone as the light can be disruptive. Clear your mind and don’t focus on your worries for the next day; try to clear your mind so you can trail off.Do some relaxation before bed. Try some gentle yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Relaxation can help you cope with daily stressors and relieve them regularly. Practicing relaxation for 30 minutes each day can keep depression away and can help stabilize your moods.Get in the habit of practicing stress reduction by setting aside time every morning or night for a practice.


Find relaxation methods that feel good and that you want to do every day. Try daily yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, qi gong, tai chi, or meditation. You can sue guided meditation, take a meditation class, or meditate on your own after you learn how.

, Alcohol and drugs often lead to altered states, which can include confusion, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium. Drugs alter the chemicals in your brain, so if you’re already struggling with instability, it’s best to keep far from substances and alcohol. Substances can trigger psychosis or other psychiatric problems, so staying sober can help you manage your moods and mental abilities more soundly.Stay away from peers who use drugs and alcohol. Have friends that don’t do drugs and you’ll be less likely to do them, too.
It’s okay to say “No thanks” if you’re offered drugs or alcohol. You can also walk away or say, “I don’t do that.”

Notice when you start to feel angry.,
Take deep breaths and think about something else.,
Try using visualization to calm down.,
Get a stress ball.,
Listen to calm music.,
Try a quick strategy to take your mind off your anger.",How to Control Anger (Tweens and Teenagers)1," Your body starts to give hints that you are becoming angry before you even realize it. If you recognize your body's warning signs, you can calm yourself down before you do or say something you regret.


You might feel yourself breathing faster than usual, or maybe your face is red and feels hot. Your hands might be clenched in fists, or you mind find that you are tensing up your jaw.Try to name the feeling you are experiencing and attribute it to something that happened as well. For example, you can try saying to yourself, ""Ok, I'm mad because I didn't get want I wanted from that teacher. This is an uncomfortable feeling, but it will pass, then I can say something or ask her about it."";
, As you feel your body warning you that you are becoming angry, try to calm yourself down right away. The more your body becomes agitated, the more difficult it will be to calm down.


Breathe in through your nose as deeply as you can as you count to five. Then, breathe out through your mouth as you count down from five. Repeat this a couple of times.

, Using visualization can help you to gain insight about yourself and it may help you to calm down as well.You can use a guided visualization CD or do a simple guided visualization on your own. The next time you are feeling angry, try sitting in a quiet, comfortable place and closing your eyes.


You can also play some relaxing music to help you stay focused.
Keep your eyes closed and then begin to visualize a serene place, such as a quiet lake in a forest, a sandy beach, or a mountaintop. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and feeling of this place.
Continue doing this for around 10 to 15 minutes.

, Stress balls can help you calm your anger down. Keep the ball with you when you know you're likely to get upset, like at school or at home, and squeeze it when you feel yourself start to become angry.


You can pretend that the ball is the situation that is making you angry. Squeeze it and feel yourself releasing some of that anger into the ball.

, Before you go to school or another place that you feel angry, listen to calming songs. You can even make a playlist on your MP3 player or phone with songs that make you feel calm, confident, or happy. Take deep breaths while listening; this will calm you down more.

Know that you can always go home.",How to Run Away With Your Boyfriend," If you are young, it can be extremely easy to make decisions based on temporary emotions. Instead of packing up your things and fleeing your house in the heat of the moment, try to calm down before you make any big decisions. Your decision to run away will not affect only you, and it’s important that you are fully confident in your decision before you take off.Are you in a fight with your parents? When you live with your parents and you’re not on good terms with them, it can be really unpleasant. However, working out momentary problems can be a much simpler (and cheaper) solution than uprooting your entire life.
If your boyfriend is convincing you to run away, think about if it’s worth it. If your boyfriend loves you, he will not force you to change your entire life and leave your home to be with him. You have your entire life to support yourself, pay bills, and create a life with your partner, so why leave your home before you need to?;
, Running away with your boyfriend is a very drastic decision, and it’s crucial to consider all other options first. If you are unhappy with something at home, such as a lack of privacy, strained relationships, or strict rules, try talking to your parents first. If you sit down and address the issues in a calm and mature way, you may be able to find a compromise without having to relocate with your boyfriend. If there are major issues, suggest family counseling. Counselors can teach you how to communicate with each other more effectively, and correct issues that may be causing volatility in your home.

, You are making a huge decision with him, and it’s important that you see each other as teammates. Talk to him openly about why you are running away, how you will handle certain obstacles, and what goals you have for your future together. Running away together can seem like a romantic fairytale, but there are real, unromantic problems that can arise.Consider things like, will you two pay for everything 50/50? How will you handle it together if you run out of money? What will he do if he loses his job? To start a life together successfully, you both need to be committed, responsible, and motivated.

, Talking to someone can help you evaluate your situation and determine if leaving home is the best thing for you to do. Talk to an adult you trust, like a relative, teacher, school counselor, or a friend's parents. If there isn't an adult that you feel comfortable talking to about your options, call the National Runaway Safeline (1-800-RUNAWAY) to talk to someone there about your situation. There are lots of resources you can call upon for help before you make the drastic decision to leave., If you and your boyfriend are running away, you will be taking on full financial responsibility. You may rely on your parents or other family members for financial help now, and sometimes you aren’t even aware of how much help they provide. You will both need to find stable jobs, if you don’t already have them. If you are still in school, you will need to work after class and on the weekends in order to support yourself.Check Craigslist, Monster, Indeed, SimplyHired, and other job sites for job listings in the area you are going to.
Unless you have to leave in a hurry, it’s best to line up your employment before you leave.

, Unless an incredibly generous friend or family member has offered you a place to live rent-free, you will need to find a new home. Keep in mind that the cost of living varies from place to place. For example, it is much cheaper to live in a small town than it would be to live in New York City. Search the web for available apartments or houses for rent, and figure out something that will fit into your budget. A good rule of thumb is that 30% of your monthly income should go to rent.If you make $2,000 a month and your boyfriend makes $2,000 a month, you have a combined total of $4,000 to work with. Thirty-percent of $4,000 is $1,200, so look for apartments that cost that much or less.
Once you find a place to live, you will need to put down your deposit. Make sure you’ve set aside money for that before move-in day.

, When you run away, you will be responsible for grocery shopping, cooking, doing laundry, and paying bills. If you already do these things or know how to do these things, you have an advantage. If you’ve never done these things before, it’s helpful to learn before you leave in order to make your transition smoother.Observe the things that your parents do around the house so that you understand all of the responsibilities you will have.
Read wikiHow articles on how to do basic tasks, like doing the laundry. Find simple recipes online to learn how to cook.

, Plan a date that you and your boyfriend will officially leave. If you can, plan a date far enough in advance that you can make all your arrangements before moving day. If you do not have the luxury of time, you will have to do the best you can to make all of your arrangements on short notice.


If you know that running away will cause a big commotion among your family members, make sure that only you and your boyfriend know your departure date. Try not to act suspicious as the day approaches.

, If you have a car, that’s great. However, if the car is in your parents' name and you’re leaving home without their support, this might be a problem. They may demand you bring the car back, or there could be legal consequences. If you bought the car yourself, there shouldn't be an issue. Don't forget to budget car insurance into your finances so that you're protected if anything happens. If you plan on flying, taking a bus, or taking a train, make sure you save money for that ticket in advance.

, Again, this is only if you have enough time. If you are running away from a bad situation and don’t have time to save money, you can ignore this step. However, if you do have time to save a little nest egg before you do, it is very wise. Even the most frugal people with the strictest budgets can have unexpected expenses come up, so it’s really smart to have money saved up just in case.Start living frugally before you leave to save extra cash. Stop spending money on eating out, getting coffee, getting your nails done, and any other frivolous expenses. Instead, put all of that money towards your “running away” fund.

, If you live at home with your parents, you may not realize all of the various costs that you will face when you live with your boyfriend. For example, do your parents pay for your cell phone? Doctors bills? Do they purchase the things you use around the house, like laundry detergent, hand soap, toothpaste, paper towels, and toilet paper? All of these things add up, and you need to be prepared. Start writing down necessities that you will need to purchase once you leave, and calculate how much money you will need to allocate for different things.When you start living on your own, you will inevitably have expenses you didn’t plan for. That’s OK! Do the best you can to prepare.
When in doubt, overestimate. It’s better to allocate too much money for something that not enough.

, The importance of creating a budget when you’re living on your own and supporting yourself financially for the first time cannot be overstated. Once you’ve determined how much income you’ll be getting and how much you’ll be paying in rent, figure out how much money you’ll need to set aside for things like utilities, gas (if you have a car), groceries, health insurance, and any other unavoidable expenses.Things like cable and Internet should only be considered after all of your necessities are covered.


Once you’ve created a budget, stick to it! If you know that you only have $100 a month for fun stuff, you probably can’t say yes to every single invitation you get. You can’t spend $200 on a shopping spree if you want to be able to pay your rent.

, Avoid a screaming match by sneaking out while they're away at work or out to eat. It can be tempting to make a dramatic exit, but that could potentially hold you up or make things trickier. Instead, just take your bags and slip out the door when the coast is clear.


If your parents don't leave the house often, or if you have a flight or bus to catch and your parents are home, try to leave discreetly when they're in another room or sleeping. Get creative to find a way out, if you must.
You can find a lot more information about executing the perfect exit here.


, This help is optional, but it can be helpful to you. If you leave a note explaining that you've chosen to leave and have made arrangements, your parents may be less likely to call authorities. If you simply disappear, they could suspect foul play. By explaining that you left on your own and you have a plan, they'll at least have some information. They may try contacting you personally, and you can explain more then if you choose to.

, Don't bring your iPhone, iPad, or any smart electronic device with you. Your parents will be able to track these, especially if you're on a family plan.Do not use a credit or debit card either, as those can create a record of your whereabouts. Pay for things in cash, and buy a cheap pay-as-you-go phone once you hit the road. The less you use electronics, whether it be your iPhone or electronic payment, the less chance you have of leaving a trail to you.


Stay off social media. This seems obvious, but in a world of constant communication, it's tempting to post a quick status on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram about your dramatic exit or plans for a new life. Don't! Any electronic information that you provide will help your parents or authorities track you down.

, Even if you're angry with your parents and they're angry with you, know that you always have the ability to go home. If you find yourself in trouble or if you're unable to support yourself, don’t be afraid to go home and ask for help and forgiveness.

Learn to say how you are feeling, even if you are very mad.,
Ask for what you want and need.,
Treat other people how you want to be treated.,
Figure out a solution.",How to Control Anger (Tweens and Teenagers)2," Instead of yelling, saying mean things, or pouting and not saying anything at all, you should express the way you are feeling. If you don't say how you are feeling, the anger will build up inside of you until you do or say something you regret.Try telling the person, ""I am so upset right now. I can't talk about this until I calm down a little bit.""
You might also say, ""I feel so embarrassed and angry when you call me that.""

, Sometimes teens and tweens get mad because they are disappointed, confused, or because someone does something they don't like. But other people won't know why you are upset or how to help you unless you say.


Don't just sit and let the anger grow inside of you. Talk to the person who upset you.
If you are mad because a friend is gossiping about you, tell your friend to stop. Try saying, ""I feel hurt when you talk about me. I want you to stop talking about me when I am not around.""

, Just because you are angry about something doesn't mean it's ok to hurt others. When you're mad, take a minute to think about what you say or do. Don't ever hit anyone or call someone names just because you're mad.


Try to remember that being mean when someone is making you angry will not fix the problem. All it will do is cause more problems, and maybe even get you into trouble., If you are angry about something in particular, think about what needs to change for you to feel better. Getting mad doesn't usually change things, but you can take action to make the situation better or keep it from happening again. Is someone treating you unfairly? Perhaps you could explain the problem to them and ask them to treat you differently. Are you angry because your teacher gave you so much homework? Ask your parent to help you work through it, then do something you enjoy like playing ball outside.

Figure out what is making you so mad.,
Report bullies or other people who make you mad on purpose.,
Talk to a counselor or other adult you trust.,
Be sure you're getting enough rest.,
Make sure you are getting enough to eat and drink.,
Try practicing prayer or deep breathing.",How to Control Anger (Tweens and Teenagers)3," There are a lot of things that might anger you. Figuring out which things are your ""triggers"" that set you off can help you avoid those situations.Sometimes there is one thing that makes you mad, like when your parents don't give you what you want or don't listen to you. If you can identify which situation makes you angry, you can avoid it or prepare ahead of time to not get so angry when it happens.
Sometimes you might feel angry about everything that happens, even if it is something that doesn't normally make you mad. If this happens, it might be because you are starting to go through puberty, which is normal and common at this age. Talk to your parents or doctor if you think that this might be the case., If there is someone at school who is picking on you or making you mad, tell someone about it. Talk to a parent, teacher, or school counselor about what is going on.


You may also want to do whatever you can to avoid the person until the issue is resolved, such as taking a different route to school or steering clear of the person during lunch.
Check out this helpful article if you need help dealing with a bully in your life.

, Your school counselor can calm you down and help you make good decisions even when you're upset. Try setting up a meeting with your school counselor to discuss your anger issues.


Try saying something like, “I am struggling to control my feelings of anger sometimes and I think I need some help.”
If you're very angry, tell both your parents and the staff of the school.

, Some teens and tweens get angry more often if they are tired. Be sure you are getting enough rest at night, and not trying to do too many activities during the day when you're not well-rested.


Tweens and teens need between 9 and 10 hours of sleep every night. That's a lot! But most tweens and teens only get 7 hours of sleep.If you're not getting enough, you might need to go to bed earlier if you have to get up early for school.
You can also try taking a cat-nap for an hour or so after school if you are feeling really stressed out.

, This might sound silly, but many people have more angry outbursts when they're hungry or thirsty. Even adults can get ""hangry""-- hungry and angry!


Try to eat healthy foods instead of foods high in sugar or fat. Snacks like string cheese, apples with peanut butter, or a banana can help keep you from feeling angry.

, Even teens and tweens can learn to relax themselves using prayer or meditation. Try whichever one is right for you, and do it regularly, not just when you're feeling angry.


Try spending five or ten minutes at night before bed relaxing with deep breathing. This can help you sleep better and calm your feelings.
You might also try a nightly thankfulness prayer. You can say thank you for all of the good things in your life and remember that the things that make you angry are small in comparison to all the good things you enjoy."

Recognize signs of stress.,
Share your feelings.,
Find a creative outlet.,
Get active and find a physical activity that you enjoy.",How to Deal with Emotional Stress (for Teens)1," People tend to associate stress with negative events, but happy occasions can also increase stress. This sometimes makes it difficult to identify when we are experiencing a higher level of stress.


Physiological signs are often easier to identify, so listen to your body. Common physical responses to stress include: digestive problems (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, or indigestion), sleeping problems (insomnia or sleeping too much), an increase or decrease of appetite, shortness of breath and rapid heart rate and/or headaches.;
, For some, the natural response to feeling overwhelmed is to reduce social interactions, but keeping your stress bottled up will only exacerbate the problem. Emotional support will decrease your stress by eliminating confounding feelings of being alone in your struggles. Seek out friends and family to confide in. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone you know, you can join social support groups or use a general support hotline., In addition to distracting you from your worries, creating something also provides a sense of accomplishment. Find the creative medium that feels most cathartic for you.


Write about it. Poetry and creative writing are great ways for you to experience an emotional release and feel productive. Keeping a journal can help organize your thoughts and help prepare you to talk to others about your problems.Draw or paint it. Drawing and painting are some of the easiest and most convenient ways to reduce stress, as is crafting and sculpting. This is particularly beneficial to teens.Sing about it. If you aren't musically gifted, don't worry. You do not need to produce original pieces, and nobody else needs to hear it. Singing along to your favorite songs, especially those you feel represent your current emotional experience, will distract you from your worries and help you release emotion., Physical activity has been shown to relieve stress, and regular exercise may improve your ability to cope over time.Getting involved in group sports is a great way to commit to regular exercise and also increase opportunities to interact with others.

Recognize distorted thoughts.,
Focus on the positives.,
Look for opportunities.,
Identify your strengths.",How to Deal with Emotional Stress (for Teens)2," We create much of our own stress. We start to have negative thoughts when we are faced with potentially stressful events.

When we substitute our negative thoughts with more positive ones, we can change the way we feel. You can expose distorted thinking by asking yourself a few questions:


Am I assuming the worst? There are usually multiple possible outcomes to a situation, but we tend to focus on the worst, even if it isn't the most likely.

Am I creating unnecessary limitations? We often create ideal scenarios, with guidelines or rules about how to achieve that success. When circumstances change, we often apply those rules to new possible solutions, without realizing we set them arbitrarily to begin with. We will then dismiss possible solutions that don't fit the originally established guidelines.

Am I ignoring potential resources? It's easy to get caught up in our negative thinking patterns and start to feel the situation is hopeless. When we feel hopeless, we tend to give up. Commit to looking for additional resources, and you may be surprised by what you can find.

, Once you've recognized your negative thinking patterns, start to change them by focusing on the positives. Look for silver linings, even in the most difficult situations. Humor is a good way to turn the negative into something more positive.If you struggle to find any benefit at all, focus on the fact that nothing lasts forever. It will soon be the past and your struggles will be nothing but a memory.
For example, social rejection can be devastating, but the social circumstances of high school usually don't extend beyond graduation. Social groups generally break up in adulthood.

, Even if you have failed, don't allow yourself to feel defeated. When one door closes, another door opens.

Think about how you can take what you've learned and become something better. If the stressful situation doesn't resolve in your favor, you will find what other things you are then free to pursue.
For example, if you are not accepted to the college you've spent your entire high school career preparing for, you are then free to apply to and explore other colleges, other majors and other career paths. By being open to possibilities, you may find something far more rewarding than what you intended.

, We focus on our perceived weaknesses, but we can choose to focus on our strengths and abilities.Try thinking about how a weakness might actually be beneficial in some instances. Maybe this weakness can somehow be turned into a strength.
For example, if you are shy, you might be a really good listener and considerate of others' thoughts and feelings. Shyness may be perceived negatively, but thoughtfulness is positive.

"
"
Recognize when you need help.,
Identify potential resources.,
Ask for intervention.",How to Deal with Emotional Stress (for Teens)3," It can be difficult to admit when we need it. Some people feel asking for help is a sign of weakness, when it actually takes exceptional insight and courage. Identify what stressors you can get through with only a little help from friends and which might require greater intervention.


Signs requiring intervention include: extreme mood swings, self harm or thoughts of self harming, suicidal thoughts, feeling hopeless, uncontrollable crying, outbursts of anger or a desire to harm others., You may feel like you're alone, but there are lots of people who care and want to help you. Find someone you feel comfortable talking to and other people who can help you further.


Parents are usually who you can confide in but if you feel you can't talk to them, there are always other people. Your school counselor can help you talk to your parents. Helplines are a good way to connect with someone if you don't feel you can talk about your problems face to face., After identifying the people you'd like to help you, communicate your specific needs. Sometimes just telling someone about your problem is enough, sometimes it isn't. If it isn't, even people close to you may not realize the severity of the situation. By telling others what you need, you'll eliminate the guess work they'd need to give you the best possible help.


If you don't know exactly how they can help, maybe tell them you'd like to start seeing a therapist or mental health counselor. Mental health professionals are trained to help you figure what you need and how to get it.

, Keep a journal and write out your best qualities, such as kindness, mercy to others, and strength. Read this when you feel down.

, Don't look in the mirror and say something negative about yourself. Put a post-it note on your bathroom mirror that says ""good morning, beautiful!"", or an inspirational quote.

, Forget the insults. People only give insults because they need to put other people down to feel superior.

Forget perfection.,

Practice daily affirmations.,
List out your core values and beliefs.,
Make decisions based on these values.,
Use your body in ways that make you proud.,
Use your body in physical ways.,
Wear clothes that make you feel confident.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Stay in control of your own life.,
Go out and be useful to others.,
Find ways to express your creativity.",How to Stop Hating Yourself," Self-loathing is the result of a distorted and entirely negative view of yourself–a view based in fantasy, denial, and delusion. In order to move into reality, you have to learn to be honest and take control of your own life. Nobody's perfect. Trying to hold yourself to a standard of perfection will result in spirals of self-loathing. If you want to stop hating yourself, abandon this way of thinking as soon as possible.


Stop comparing yourself to people you see on television and in advertisements. Compare yourself to yourself, not to others. Life doesn't work in 30-minute increments, and doesn't come with its own Photoshop re-touching. Short-cut to happiness? Cut out the television and the social networking for a while and spend more time with one-on-one interactions.;
, Self loathing works in cycles, sometimes stemming from childhood or early adulthood trauma. But it's not always a single, notable memory that can trigger self-loathing. Certain people, situations, or behaviors can quickly force you to spiral into negative ways of thinking, making it worse. Learn to identify the thoughts or situations that cause this response, so you can better head them off at the pass.


The next time you feel some self-loathing coming on, stop yourself by saying out loud–literally–""I'm not going there."" Stop and take stock. What's happening around you? What are you responding to? Get out a piece of paper and write your thoughts down. Writing your thoughts is a a kind of catharsis and it will make you feel better.

, What do you usually do when you start feeling hateful toward yourself? Crawl into bed and watching television instead of going out? Drinking to excess? Overeating? Most self-loathers have in common that their coping mechanisms end up making the problem worse. Whatever you do to cope, find it and replace it with something more positive.


If you struggle with over-indulgence in food or drink, make it impossible. Keep the ice cream and the cookies out of the kitchen, and replace them with fresh fruit and vegetables. If you struggle with isolation, force yourself to go out more.

, Talking to yourself in a mirror sound weird? It might be at first, but it's proven helpful to a large number of people suffering intense pangs of self-loathing, with some time and consistency. Find a positive mantra to recite to yourself in the mirror when you're experiencing your triggers and get yourself back on track. They don't need to be complicated. Consider the following:


I'm good enough.
I'm in control of my life.
I can do this.
I'm beautiful, intelligent, and kind.

, What are your core values, the ideas and concepts that really mean something to you? Many times these are abstract concepts like loyalty, sacrifice, selflessness, kindness, or equality. You may also value things like creativity, strength, or education. What are the rules by which a good person lives their life? Make a list and review it daily. Update the list as it comes to you.


If it helps, think about this as your own personal code and write it out accordingly. If you were forming a club, what would be the traits and values that the other members would live by, if it were up to you?

, Often, self-loathing occurs when our actions are misaligned with our values. Every time you are faced with a choice, even if it's just a choice with how you'd like to spend your free time, double-check that you decision is in line with your core values. Ask, ""Will this make me feel better or worse about myself?""


If a core value on your list is creativity, how will you spend your free time? There's always Netflix, or you could get cracking on that novel you've always meant to write. Keep your actions consistent with your beliefs.

, Just as we must make decisions to act in ways that align with our values, we must use our physical bodies in ways that make us proud to inhabit them. What can your body do for you? How can you use your body in a positive way that will promote positive thinking and self-love?


Decide what ""treating yourself right"" means. ""Right"" might mean different things for different people, but you can go about it in the same way with your decisions. What behavior will make you proud of your body?
While certain things might feel good in the moment, they may also contribute to cycles of self-loathing down the road. Every drinking binge has a hangover at the end of it. In general, you want to avoid self-destructive behaviors, like substance abuse to stay proud of your body.

, Do things with your body to make it work for you. Hike to the top of a mountain so you can look down at the valley below and say, ""I did this in my body!"" Go out dancing and make exercise fun. Devote yourself to learning a particular yoga, or new dance style and you'll be making your body work for you. The exercise will be a by-product of that positive use of your body.


It's easy to become obsessed with the numbers. How much weight you've gained or lost, how many steps you took yesterday on your pedometer, how many calories you've consumed. If you're struggling with body-issues and self-esteem, it's important to stay focused on what's most important: your health and happiness.
While it may be a goal to lose weight, your ultimate goal should be developing a positive body image. Calorie-burning should be a good benefit of doing things you like doing, not torturing yourself. Find a way of being physical that you genuinely enjoy and you'll be much closer to self-love and a positive body image.

, You don't have to dress any particular way except the way that helps you to feel the most comfortable and confident about your body. Ideas about what is ""flattering"" and what is ""sexy"" are highly subjective across cultures, and if you want to build a positive body self-image, it's important for you to decide how you can clothe yourself to feel like the most confident version of yourself.


In general, it's good to put less stock in what fashion magazines have to say about the way you dress yourself. ""Feeling confident"" isn't synonymous with ""being trendy,"" especially if current trends involve super-tight high-waisted pants. Try to strike a balance between comfort and a style you like.
It's over-simple to say that clothes don't matter. While they're not as important to work on as other things, it can be a big confidence booster to put some thought into your appearance, and clothes are one of the easiest ways to do this. Would a leather jacket make you confident? Consider it.

, The fastest way to develop an unhealthy sense of body image and spiraling self-loathing is to constantly compare yourself to others, especially celebrities or fashion icons. You don't have a responsibility to look any particular way for anyone other than yourself.

, While it might seem like you're the one doing the hating, it might really be the fear of the rejection of others, or an over-emphasis on the opinions of others that gives you self-esteem troubles. Easiest way to break out? Stop hanging out with people who don't build you up. Critics, complainers, and haters should have no place in your life.


Look at your close friends. Are they suffering from similar issues? Are they projecting these issues and anxieties onto you? If so, consider making a break. Find friends that you can rely on to not drag you through the muck.
If you're in a relationship with someone who is criticizing, manipulative, or feeds your anxieties about yourself, you're giving yourself the short end of the stick. You can do better. End the relationship and find someone who'll love you for who you are.

, Psychologists often describe what is called an ""locus of control,"" which can be placed either internally or externally. People with an internal locus of control look to themselves to decide whether or not they're successful. People with external locus? They look outward.


You can't change the way others perceive you, and it's a waste of time to try. Instead, focus on shifting your locus of control inward. You don't have any responsibility to others, you have one to yourself.

, If you're struggling with self-hatred, it may be helpful to think about others for a while and remind yourself how fortunate you really are. Volunteering your time can be an excellent way to build self-esteem and give back at the same time. It's hard not to feel valuable and valued at the end of a day spend contributing in a positive way to your community.


If your job is part of the aggravation, make a switch. Pushing a pencil all day's not doing for you anymore? Find something that benefits your community more directly. Take a risk to make a change in your life and commit to your own happiness. You are in control of your life.

, Instead of wallowing, decide to exercise your creative impulses and make something. Pick up a new hobby or return to an older hobby or interest that you may have abandoned at some point along the way. Want to write a novel? Start painting? Pick up an instrument? Get active and give yourself something to stay consistently proud of.

Keep your head up and your shoulders relaxed, allowing your arms to swing naturally by your sides.You’ll be surprised at how confident you come across when you walk with a sense of purpose.

, Communicate your confidence by smiling at people when appropriate. Avoid showing too many teeth because this might give the impression that you’re seeking approval from others.Direct your smile to people who return it and avoid smiling at people who give off a negative vibe.

, Look in the mirror to determine your body type, dominant skin tone, and any unique characteristics you would like to highlight or minimize. Knowing your body shape will help you find clothes and patterns that look best on you. Knowing your dominant skin tone will help you find and choose color combinations that you like and make you feel confident.

, Observe people whose fashion you admire. Look in magazines, on TV, in films, and in real life. Look closely to see how they’ve chosen their outfits. Make notes about what you like and don’t like.

, Separate your clothing, shoes, and accessories into three separate categories: love it, not sure, hate it. Get rid of everything in the ‘hate it’ pile. Get rid of items of clothing that you haven’t worn in a long time. Ask yourself whether you feel confident in the clothing that remains and get rid of any items you’re not sure about., Create a list of items you want before you go shopping. Set yourself a budget and pay with cash to avoid impulse purchases. Only purchase clothing that fits your style needs and makes you feel confident the instant you put it on.

Focus on experiences, not appearance.,
Provide opportunity for accomplishments.,
Take responsibility.",How to Increase Teenager Self Esteem Effectively1," It’s not healthy for anybody’s self-esteem to be rooted in their appearance. Our physical appearance changes rapidly, can be negatively affected by many things, and definitions of beauty vary from person to person. Choose something more stable to be proud of: experience and accomplishments which cannot be taken away.;
, Do things with your life that you are proud of. This is generally good advice for anyone of any age. If you see someone who seems to do everything in life that you want to do, go do those things. There are lots of different things to do so choose something that you think is rewarding or important. This will go further than anything else to raise your self-esteem.


Learn an instrument. Choose an instrument that you always wanted to be able to play and then learn how to play it. This will give you a great sense of accomplishment and happiness. It takes time and effort, but music classes are easily available through your local community center, community colleges, high schools, and through private tutoring.
Travel. Travel the world and see things that you think are interesting. This doesn’t have to be expensive. Money can be saved by using youth hostels, couch surfing, traveling by train or carpool, or just keeping an eye out for great deals on plane tickets. Lots of amazing things to see are located nearby and can be seen or experienced for free. Traveling will give you confidence, as well as more than a few great stories to tell.
Learn a visual art or sport. Which one of these you do will depend largely on if you are naturally a more physical person or a more mental person. Both, however, take time and a lot of practice to learn. You can take classes but you’ll learn best by doing, and especially doing them with other people. Doing art or sports will give you a great way to ease into interacting with others and meeting new people, since doing those activities with others is much more fun than doing them yourself.
Make academic accomplishments when you can. Get better grades, consider taking honors classes, and do your best in extracurriculars. These will make you feel good but will also help you later on in life. You will have better opportunities to make money and will be able to get much more satisfying jobs by working hard in school and going to college.

, Taking responsibility is a great way to build self-esteem and confidence. In doing important things, you will not only assure yourself that you are a capable person but also provide yourself proof that you have a positive impact on the world.Get a job. Getting a job will not only give you money to save for college or spend on things you want, it will also give you something to be proud of. Try to get a job that helps others, like an attendant at a nursing home or a grocery bagger. This will make you feel good about what you are doing.
Volunteer. Volunteering is a great way to boost your self-esteem. You will do valuable things for others and you can often boost your own skills while doing it. You can work in a local soup kitchen, build houses for Habitat for Humanity, or start your own volunteering group based on an issue which is important to you. These types of experiences also look very good on college applications.
Tutor or mentor other students. Using your life experiences to help other teens and younger students will make you feel much better about yourself. You can help students through your high school or middle school, or you can try to help at a local school which is designated low-income or high-risk. This will let you help the people that need it most.

Reduce your stress.,
Do something every day that you love.,
Spend time with those you love.",How to Boost Your Mental Health by Building a Daily Routine1," Many times you threaten your own mental health by putting far too many tasks on your to-do list and attempting the impossible. Spend a few days figuring out how long it takes you to complete your daily tasks. Then, build a schedule around that with extra room for travel, emergencies, and breaks.


Make it easier on yourself by tackling the grueling projects first. Also, be sure to include time for basic activities like cleaning, eating, and exercising.;
, Many people open their eyes then reach for their phones when they wake up. They check their emails, social media pages, and texts. Starting your day off by finding out what other people need from you can stop you from being proactive and instead, reactive.


Rather, start your day off by focusing on you. Make yourself some coffee, take a shower, spend some time reading. Putting your needs first when you wake up can set the tone for a great day.Be sure to disconnect from all of your devices for a while every day. Being constantly distracted by emails, texts, and social media messages can cause tension.

, Stress is extremely bad for your health. Too much of it can damage your brain. Creating a routine that involves as little stress as possible can not only make for a good day, but can boost your mental health, as well.


Do what you can during your daily routine to reduce the stress. This may mean carpooling to work or leaving earlier to avoid traffic, delegating some of your responsibilities to other people, or doing whatever you need to do to eliminate as much stress as possible., Life is full of responsibilities and people often don’t make time to just have fun. You can boost your mental health by adding something you enjoy doing into your daily routine. You may have to put your needs in front of others to achieve this, but it’s necessary.


Play a sport, a musical instrument, or a game. You could read a book, take a trip to the park, or even stop for a cup of tea. Do whatever you love once a day and you’ll feel and see the positive effects.Pay attention to how often you do things you don’t want to do. Frequently doing things you don’t want to do may mean that you need to say “no” more often.
Keep in mind that it is also okay to just do nothing sometimes. You don’t always need to be busy.

, Seeing people you love and appreciate each day can have a positive impact on your health. Make it a priority to see your friends, family, significant other, kids, or whomever you respect and have adoration for on a daily basis. Seeing them can boost your happiness, reduce your stress, and improve your overall health.


Use technology to see your loved ones each day if doing so in person isn’t possible. You could also join a group or attend a class to meet people if you don’t have many who bring you joy."

Don’t live to please others.,
Develop a sense of style.,
Explore your passions.,
Find people who understand you.,
Be assertive.",How to Increase Teenager Self Esteem Effectively2," Your life is exactly that: your life. You should be living your life and doing things so that you are happy, not to please anyone else. There is a saying that you can’t please everybody and it is absolutely true, so don’t expect or try to make everyone happy all the time. The best you can do is make yourself happy and try to live according to what you believe is right and good.


Most importantly, you will develop the greatest sense of self-worth when you stop trying to please the “popular” crowd and start trying to please yourself. If pleasing yourself means that you want to have a lot of friends, then do things that make other people want to be friends with you by accomplishing great things and being a wonderful person. Don’t try to make friends by wearing the right clothes or getting into trouble. People that spend time with you for these reasons aren’t really your friends and will only end up hurting you in the long run.

, Be you, don’t be someone else. Instead of going with the crowd and wearing all the popular brands, develop a unique sense of style. This will make you stand out and give you confidence by giving you something to identify with. Be sure that this style is one that means something to you and that you feel communicates something about who you are as a person.


Style inspirations include: 1920-40’s “dapper” look, 1980’s punk, japanese street fashion, or early 1990’s grunge. Any style or image which speaks to you is great!

, Figure out who you are and what makes you happy by exploring things you care about or find interesting. Do you think parkour looks cool? Do it! Have you always wanted to learn how to dance? Do it! The only thing barring you from pursuing things that you’re passionate about is you.Many high schools have clubs which will give you the chance to try out new sports, games, arts and other activities. Local community colleges or universities will also have clubs which teens may be able to participate in if they ask very nicely and pay a small fee.

, The best way to deal with the harder aspects of life is to have great friends. Great friends remind you how fun and wonderful you really are. To keep your self-esteem high, find friends who understand and like you for who you really are.


Good friends should like a lot of the same things as you and have some of the same goals in life. This will make sure that you connect on a deeper level and will help you motivate each other throughout your friendship. It’s okay if your friends don’t like all of the same things that you do, however. Some differences are good and will allow you to open up your mind to new possibilities.Don’t be friends with people who drag you down. Anyone who makes your life worse isn’t really your friend. If they make you feel bad about yourself or they want you to do bad things, then you shouldn’t be friends with them. Friends should bring out the best in us, not the worst!

, Don’t just let people push you around. Don’t just give in to the desires of everyone around you. It’s good to try to make people happy and it’s good not to be self-centered, but you need to focus on you and being your own person. Being assertive, standing up for what’s right for you, will do a lot for your self-confidence and self-esteem.If you are having a conversation with your friends or classmates, give your opinion. Ask for things that you need. Say “no” when you need or want to say “no”. And most importantly: don’t feel guilty when you do these things!

Practice proper hygiene.,
Wear clean, nice clothing.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise.,
Eat healthy.",How to Increase Teenager Self Esteem Effectively3," One thing you need to do in order to build your self-esteem is to practice proper hygiene. In taking care of yourself, you will come to care for yourself more and more. To take care of yourself, you’ll need to practice proper hygiene. Wash your hair, and your skin regularly. Brush your teeth and your hair. Use deodorant. Wash your hands when needed. This will help you feel good about your body.


If you or your family have a hard time paying for personal hygiene items, there are often many resources in the community where you can get them for free. Local churches and organizations will often have services that provide necessities. If they don’t, they may know where to look for help.

, Take care of your clothes. Wash them when they’re dirty and fold them to keep them from getting wrinkled. Don’t keep clothes that have a lot of holes or are ripped. Try to remove stains from clothing and if they can’t be removed, get rid of the clothes. Wear clothing that fits, not clothes that are too small or way too baggy.


If you have problems getting new clothes, you can get clothing for free from many local churches and community outreach centers. Thrift stores will also have clothing that is much cheaper than what you’d pay in normal stores. If you’re worried that all you can find is outdated clothing, try thrift stores in nice towns or nice parts of town. Stores next to big colleges will be your best bet. This will increase your chances of finding clothes which are practically new and certainly nice enough to wear for many years.

, Teenage years are formative years, and many teens suffer from a deficit of sleep. You may think it's fine to skimp on sleep, but this practice actually has a serious impact on your health. Scientists have found that poor or little sleep is associated with lower rates of optimism and self-esteem.

So if you want an easy way to boost your self-esteem as a teen, shoot to get at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night., A big part of feeling good in your own skin is exercising. Extra fat or generally being out of shape can make you feel sluggish, out of breath, or just unpleasant. Exercise will help you feel more energetic and healthier.


Anything which gets your heart rate up for at least ten minutes is exercise. Work out by jogging, doing push-ups and crunches, or doing squats. Anything that works for you is perfectly fine...just be consistent and don’t give up!

, Eating healthy, like exercising, will lead you to feel better in your own skin. Eating a lot of junk food will weigh you down and make you feel sluggish and sick. Eating healthy food will give you more energy and you’ll feel much happier. In feeling better, you’ll be able to feel better about yourself.

"
Avoid negative people.,
Concentrate on accomplishments, not on failures.,
Remove the idea of perfection.,
Practice self-affirmations.",How to Increase Teenager Self Esteem Effectively4," Don’t spend time with anyone who is negative all the time. This will make you feel bad about yourself and the world around you. You don’t want that in your life! Instead, spend time with people who understand that sometimes life is hard or sometimes people make mistakes but that things are largely good and should be appreciated for what they are, rather than held up to a standard they can never reach.


If you have a close friend who acts like this, try to help them change. If they continue to act this way, try to spend less time with them. It’s hard but being around negative people is very unhealthy and will not help you build a good image of yourself or your life.
If you find yourself acting this way: stop. You don’t want to be that person. If there are bad things in your life, things you feel negative about, change them. Don’t complain and focus on all the bad things...make those bad things into better things!

, Don’t spend your time thinking about regrets and all of the times you did something wrong or failed in some way. Learn from those mistakes and move on. Instead of focusing on things you didn’t do right, remember all the things you excel at. Remember all the good things you’ve done. This will help you remember that you do good work and can accomplish great things when you try.


Make a list of the things you are most proud of. Post it on your bedroom wall and look at it every day. This will motivate you to keep doing good things to make that list longer and longer. See if you can get it to reach down to the floor or be taller than you are!

, There is a saying that nobody is perfect and it is absolutely true. Nobody is perfect. Nothing is perfect. Perfection isn’t a real thing. This means that you need to stop trying to be perfect. In trying to be perfect you will only constantly disappoint yourself. It’s good to strive for something but this is the wrong way to do it. Instead, think about where you are and try to take it to the next step. Strive for getting a B on that next test before trying to get an A. Sometimes you’ll surprise yourself and do better than you thought you would!

, Tell yourself every single day that you’re a good person. You have something to offer the world. You can do things that no one else can do. You can handle all the challenges that life throws at you. You can be better and happier. You will love others and you will love yourself. You will always do your best. All of these things are true if you let them be true. You just have to be willing to put in the work. Remind yourself that these things are true every day and you will feel better about yourself and your abilities.


Sometimes it may not feel like these things are true or possible but they are. If you feel like you don’t have anything unique to offer to the world, then you just haven’t found out what it is yet. If you don’t feel like you’re a good person, give yourself the opportunity to be. Sometimes it takes work to change the things we don’t like about ourselves, but if you try you will find that with time you can make yourself into a person that makes you happy.

Get enough sleep.,
Meditate.,
Play games that are designed to stimulate your brain.,
Eat foods that help your brain.",How to Boost Your Mental Health by Building a Daily Routine2," Finding time for shut eye can be difficult in your busy life, but doing so is imperative. Lack of sleep can contribute to depression, and make for an otherwise miserable day. Eliminate other activities from your day if you must, but find ample time for rest on a daily basis. Aim for 7 to 9 hours each night.


Your brain processes memories and new information while you sleep. Not giving it the time it needs to rest and restore itself can actually lead to changes in the structure of the brain., If you’ve ever tried to meditate you may have found it to be difficult at best. Providing your brain with these quiet moments daily, however, has a variety of positive effects. Improved memory, better focus, and greater decision-making skills are just a few of the benefits you may see if you meditate every day.


If you’ve tried to meditate and failed, try again. You may find that over time it becomes easier. You can also attempt to master one of the many different types of meditation, such as guided meditation, sensory meditation, moving meditation, or mindful meditation., Take a few minutes each day to play games that make you think. Games like Sudoku and crossword puzzles force you to use your brain and allow you to enjoy yourself at the same time.


Install a mind game on your phone if you don’t have much time during the day to play. Having a device with games installed with you allows you to participate in them on the train or bus ride to work, while waiting to pick up your child from school, in the lobby of your doctor’s office, or wherever you have a few minutes to spare., Believe it or not, some foods are better than others when it comes to your mental health. Foods that are rich in nutrients increase productivity and can even prevent memory loss. Eat these foods daily and you’ll likely find a noticeable boost in your mental health.


Foods that are high in Omega 3 fatty acids, such as eggs, certain fish, walnuts, and leafy greens improve concentration. Flavonoids, which are found in coffee, berries, dark chocolate, and leafy greens, also greatly benefit the brain."

Take a daily walk.,
Schedule your exercise for when your energy level is the highest.,
Incorporate muscle-building exercises into your routine.,
Look for ways to get more activity in your daily routine.",How to Boost Your Mental Health by Building a Daily Routine3," Adding a walk into your daily routine can reduce stress and even eliminate depression. It also allows you to get some fresh air and work off extra weight, which is also good for your health.


Research shows that walking 200 minutes a week, which works out to less than 30 minutes a day, can be just as effective against depression as medication. Even if you’re not depressed, walking every day can still have a positive effect on your mental health., Being tired is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to exercise. Combat this by working out when you feel most awake. You’ll reap more benefits this way and be more inclined to stick with it.


Exercise during your lunch break if you feel most awake mid-day. Going for a brisk walk or doing some jumping jacks and push-ups each day during your break can do a great deal for your mindset., Cardio isn’t the only type of exercise that can boost your mental health. Workouts that build muscles can also do wonders for your mood. Doing a mixture of aerobic and muscle-building activities can reduce your risk of depression and help you rest better.


Engage in these types of exercises three to five days a week for 30 to 60 minutes to get the most out of these workouts., Adding small bursts of activity or finding ways to get a little more movement in can help you to get more exercise. For example, you can take the stairs instead of the elevator, park further away from the entrance at the grocery store, take a walk during your lunch break, or ride your bike to run errands instead of driving."

Take the time to listen to people.",How to Stop Being a Drama Queen," One way to stop being a drama queen is to become self-aware enough to know when you're the one bringing on the drama. Do you find that you always end up getting in conflicts with people, and that no one in your life is easy to get along with? Do you find yourself getting heated, crying, or stomping your feet on a daily basis? If that's the case -- unless you're living in a war zone -- chances are that a lot of this drama is self-created. Knowing that you are the source of a lot of the drama is the first step to curbing it.


Once you see that you're the source, you'll stop blaming the people around you and will see that you're in control of the situation.;
, If you're a drama queen, then you must be an expert at taking a 3 or 4 situation up to a 10 on the drama Richter scale. The next time you're faced with a conflict or a minor disturbance, take a minute to ask yourself how big of a deal it is, in the scheme of things. Maybe your boyfriend is 10 minutes late for your date. Maybe you spilled a little bit of coffee on your sweater. Will this matter to you 10 hours from now -- or even one hour? Is it worth crying over? Is it worth ruining your day over?


These are important questions to ask yourself. Chances are, you'll see that you're making a big deal over nothing and will be able to move forward without throwing a fit.
Making a big deal over every little thing will not help your mental state. It'll make you stressed out, sleepless, and generally irritable. Remember that minimizing your problems will actually make you feel better.
If you make a big deal over everything, then no one will take you seriously when something that is actually devastating happens to you.

, A lot of the time, drama queens are the way they are because they have a low self-esteem. They may feel like people will only pay attention to them or give them the time of day if they are constantly being dramatic, loud, or talking smack about people. Ask yourself if this sounds like you, and think about your own self-image and how you really feel about yourself. When you get up and look in the mirror, what do you see? Work on loving the person you see there, and not basing your self worth on how much attention people give you.


Of course, building confidence takes a lifetime. The sooner you start realizing that your worth should come from yourself, not from what people people think of you, the sooner you'll stop creating drama.
Really think about yourself. Nobody's perfect -- what are your flaws? How can you work on addressing -- or accepting them?
Part of feeling good about yourself is hanging out with people who make you feel good. Are there people like that in your life? If everyone around you is focused on putting you down, then you won't be able to feel good about yourself until you ditch them.

, A lot of your drama may come from the fact that you feel like everyone has wronged you, that the world has treated you badly, and that you deserve a lot better than what you're getting. Of course, some of this may be true some of the time, but it's unlikely that everyone in your life is determined to make you feel horrible. Instead, get empowered by the fact that you are in control of your own destiny. Stop saying, ""I can't believe what he/she did to me…"" or ""I can't believe what happened to me…"" and start your sentences with something positive like, ""I did this cool thing today…""


Don't give people so much power over you. Instead of obsessing over what they did to you, work on doing things to make your own life better.
Ask yourself why you need to look for sympathy all the time. You don't really want that kind of attention all the time, do you? Sometimes, you may really need sympathy, so don't use up your sympathy points over nothing just to get attention.

, People who are hung up on drama tend to live in the past, obsessing on the ways that people wronged them, past fights or drama, or just situations that they wish hadn't turned out the way they had. While the past can be informative, helping us repeat the same problems over and over again, if you get too hung up on the past, you won't be able to live in the moment or to move forward. If you live in the moment, you won't be so worried about what someone said to you or how you feel you were ""wronged,"" or even about getting people back.


Instead, work on having fun with where you are, whether you're with friends or taking a long walk. Stop obsessing over the past and you'll soon find your way to a much healthier mindset.

, Writing your thoughts down in a journal can help you really process the things that have happened to you, deal with them emotionally, and take the time to deal with your problems. It's far better to write down your problems than to talk about them before you're ready, especially when you have the impulse to talk about everything with everyone within earshot. Writing things down will help you think that hey, it's not the end of the world, and can help you take a step back from your drama.


Try journaling at least once a day. If you have to talk to a friend about something that's been bothering you, for example, consider writing about the conflict first so you feel more calm about it. But remember, do not let anybody see any important things you have written in your journal. This could lead to more drama that you don't want, so be careful.

, Drama queens tend to think that almost everything is worth getting mad and throwing a fit about, but that's almost never the case. While you may hate hearing people say, ""It's not the end of the world,"" sometimes this is something you have to tell yourself when you face difficult situations. Let's say you did poorly on one test. Ask yourself if it's really going to ruin or affect your life in the long run. The answer is almost never, never yes. Think about this the next time you feel the anger boiling up, or the tears brimming in your eyes.

, Though you may be the only drama queen in your circle of friends, it's likely that there are other dramatic people around you, or just people who like to talk about their drama. Don't let them get to you, rile you up, or make you angry for no reason. If someone else is acting dramatic toward you, tell him or her to cool it, say it's not that big of a deal, and move on with it instead of letting it get to you. When it comes to other people who want to fight with you, rile you up, or just make a mountain out of a molehill, the most important thing is not to engage them.


Engaging in an argument is a choice. If someone wants to talk to you about something, insist that you'll only do it in a calm or reasonable manner.

, Some people love drama so much that they are always finding themselves in relationships where they are always fighting, crying, or just generally being dramatic. If that's the case with you, then you need to ask yourself why you need this person in your life. You may care more about the drama and the person, who just fuels the fire. Instead, go for relationships, whether they're friendships or romantic relationships, that make you feel happy, content, and at peace -- at least, most of the time.


Of course, you may be attracted to people who are high drama. The next time you meet someone like this, ask if it's really worth it.
This goes for friendships, too. Stop hanging out with your frenemies just so you have something to complain or be mad about. Only maintain friendships with people you actually care about, please.

, Another thing you can do to avoid being a drama queen is to be able to recognize your triggers. If someone says something that makes your blood boil, know when you're starting to feel yourself get angry, and excuse yourself for a minute. This may seem unnatural to you, but it's a great way to give yourself time to assess the situation and avoid saying something you'll regret. Step out for a short walk. Get a drink of water in the other room. Say you need some time to think about what happened. Being able to take a few minutes to yourself will help you deal with a situation in a rational and calm way.


Be honest with yourself. You may think you're ready to deal with a situation, but if your hands are shaking, you're tapping your feet, or you feel your temperature rising, then you may need some more time.

, This may sound silly, but a lot of the time, people create drama just because they're bored. That's right. You're sitting at home, The Bachelor is boring this season, your siblings aren't home, and you don't have anyone to annoy or mess with. Suddenly, you start thinking about that one thing your friend said to you that morning, and get really really mad…and make a passive aggressive Facebook post about it. If this sounds like you, then you simply need to find more meaningful things to do with yourself. Soon, you won't have time for drama. Here are some options:


Pick up a new hobby, like painting or writing poetry. You'll find that this is a much more useful way to release some of your energy.
Volunteer. Spending time with people who are actually in need will remind you how much you have to be thankful for -- instead of complaining about everything.
Even if you don't believe you're the type to stir up drama when bored, finding other ways to occupy your time can help.

, People who are dramatic are notorious for making absolutely everything revolve around them. When people try to tell them about a problem, they tend to say, ""…that's almost as bad as something that happened to me,"" or ""That's exactly how I felt when…"" While it's okay to try to relate to people, it's not okay to turn any situation into a problem having to do with you. People will quickly get bored and think you're an attention hog; they'll see that there's no point in confiding in you.


Instead, work on respecting people, and recognizing that they have to deal with problems (and sometimes, drama!) too.

, Another thing drama queens tend to do is react in the heat of the moment, blurting out rude and insensitive comments just because that's what comes to them. This is similar to giving yourself time to cool off. Before you say something, ask yourself if you really mean it, or if you'll regret it after five minutes. You may feel like insulting your best friend, boyfriend, or sister in the moment, but chances are, you'll feel like a fool in the long run. Instead, take the time to think about what you're going to say and ask yourself if it's really constructive or meant only to hurt people.


Don't be afraid to say, ""Hang on, I need a minute to figure out how to react…""

, Drama queens love to broadcast their drama to anyone within shooting range. Not only is it rude to give TMI to the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker, but people will also quickly tire of your antics. If something is really bothering you, then you should talk to your best friend, your mother, or a close friend about it. This will help you get another perspective, let out all of your pent-up energy, and will keep you from telling your entire math class or soccer team all of your business.


Talking to someone who actually cares about you first will help you see that you don't have to tell everyone about something the second it happened just because you absolutely have to get it off your chest. Instead, learn to be patient. Blurting things out won't help you deal with them.

, A lot of drama queens are the way they are simply because they want people to look their way. Well, the next time you want to get people to look at you, why don't you get their attention for something positive instead? Kick butt at your next soccer tournament. Be a killer Desdemona in your school's production of Macbeth. Write an awesome article for your school paper. Do things that make you feel good, and people will be impressed by them naturally -- instead of just annoyed by all of your tears and complaints.


Think about it: if you feel like people only pay attention to you when you're having drama, then you have to seriously work on finding a positive way to channel your energy.

, This may sound like the impossible, if you're used to dealing with your problems by talking about the people who are bothering you instead of talking to them. However, you must know by now that this won't get you anywhere. The next time you have a real conflict, take the time to talk to the person you're having problems with in an open and honest manner that encourages communication. This doesn't mean you have to tell the person all of the horrible things you're thinking about him or her, but it does mean that you should have a constructive conversation with the person, if you want to resolve the issue.


Take the time to calm down and to discuss the problem in a rational manner instead of getting caught up in the heat of the moment.
Sure, it's easier to just complain about the person than to deal with it. But if you deal with the problem head on, the person will have more respect for you, and you'll improve your relationship.
Take the time to hear the person out. Don't just tell the person everything you're feeling and expect him or her to have nothing to say.

, Drama queens can't help themselves. They love gossip more than Perez Hilton does. If they hear something juicy, they just can't wait to share it with their 3,000 Facebook friends. But if you want to stop your antics, then one of the easiest things you can do is to stop gossiping about people. The less you gossip, the more people will respect you, and the less they'll gossip about you in turn. This can be a bad habit to kick, but once you do it, you'll be grateful for all of the positivity that flows into your life as a result.


Instead of talking about people behind their backs, start praising people behind their backs. This will make you and everyone around you feel better.

, Drama lovers love to yell, shout, or just speak louder than everyone else so everyone hears what they have to say. This is another bad habit you've got to kick. The next time you feel yourself getting louder, take three deep breaths, and try to get your tone of voice and volume to match that of the people around you. Don't think that you just don't have the ability to talk more quietly; everyone does.


If you talk more quietly, people will want to be around you more. Nobody wants to be around a person who completely dominates them in conversation.

, What's the point? It will feel good for like, point-five seconds, and then you'll look like an idiot. Do you want people cursing at you and calling you names? If you do, then you have a problem. Only tell people the things that are constructive to helping you resolve a conflict. And if you do end up saying something hurtful, apologize.

, Your own drama should be enough to deal with, right? Don't get all worked up because of how your sister's boyfriend is acting, or about how your friend's cousin got into a fender bender. Stick with your own problems and don't put your nose where it doesn't belong. Drama queens love to feed off the drama of other people because they feel like there's not enough going on in their own lives; if you find positive things to fill your time, then this won't be you.

, Drama queens are so focused on themselves and all of the things that happened to them that they don't ever really take the time to hear other people out. When someone is talking to you, make eye contact, really take in what they're saying, and don't interrupt. See the people who mean something to you on their own terms and stop looking for opportunities to talk about your own problems. Every person in your life has his or her own problems and dreams and goals, and you should treat them as your equals, not just as people who should care about you, you, you.


People seek out good listeners because they are so hard to find. If you learn to truly listen to people, you'll be a much better friend -- and much better person -- in the process. Recognizing that other people have drama, too, will help you see that your drama isn't that exciting, after all.

You can play freerice.com (a game that gives rice to people who need it); switch your search engine to something like benelab.org (which donates all proceeds to charity); have a bake/lemonade/garage sale for a charity of your choice; or help your parents around the house.


For over 14. It is easier for you, because in addition to doing the steps for under-14s, you can volunteer at a hospital, or other charity. You can also help little siblings, or write/edit articles on WikiHow.

, Get to know new people, and talk to people you meet. Make friends with that other boy at the supermarket while your parents shop, or the kid in your science class you don't know.

, You don't have to be a health nut; you can eat fast-food and ice cream once in a while. Just exercise and eat mostly healthy foods.

, Try doing something that you have never done before. It can be as simple as a new sport, or it could be as adventurous as skydiving. It can be as old as knitting (which is not just a skill for grandmas, kids can do it too), or as recently invented as Photoshop. Find something you have never done before, that you love.

, Whether you like video games, watching TV, reading, or making home movies, don't spend all your time exercising, volunteering, and helping at home. Just don't spend all of your time watching TV either.

Learn to say “no.” Perhaps these girls are so intimidating to you that you find yourself doing things for them when they ask, even if you don’t want to or if it requires you to go out of your way.,
Approach them with kindness.",How to Not Be Intimidated by Other Girls," Remember that comparison is the thief of joy. No two people are the same and each of us as individuals bring our own collective positives and negatives to the world. Though you may be intimidated by these girls, remember that they too have flaws just like you. You can never be just like them just like they can never be like you.


Think about all of the positive attributes you have that they don’t. Perhaps you can play piano well or volleyball, or maybe you are a very nice person. Focus on your own strengths.
You might even try writing down your strengths and posting them somewhere that you will see them daily, such as on your bathroom mirror or closet door. You can invite trusted friends and family members to contribute to your list if you are having trouble coming up with a list of your strengths.;
, Though we all have a desire to fit in with others, never pretend to be different or more like others just to be accepted. Most people can sense fakeness from a mile away and no one respects a person who is not genuine. Allow your own authenticity to shine through and even if people do not respond positively to it. At least you will know that you are being true to yourself.For instance, if you notice everyone is wearing a certain brand of shoe, but you don’t like that shoe, don’t buy it just to fit in. Wear the clothes that you love and you’ll feel happier and more like yourself.
It is also important to avoid changing your personality or behavior to fit in with others. Do things that are within your moral compass and be yourself.

, These girls have their own insecurities that they likely deal with on a daily basis as well. They may be just as nervous as you around others even if they play it cool. Sometimes, we interpret others as being intimidating when they are actually just shy. Consider that possibility as well as others and move forward without making assumptions about their personality.Consider that they also may find you intimidating. This will help you feel more comfortable when you are around them if you feel that the two of you have similar feelings and are equals.
Keep in mind that social media can make anyone seem confident, even if they are not.

, Often times, the fears that you have are not as bad as you think. In interacting with these girls, consider the worst possible thing that could happen. Perhaps they might ignore you should you speak to them or maybe you fear that they will insult you. Those these situations are certainly not ideal, they are also not the end of the world. If you feel prepared for the worst, then you can be ready in the event that it does happen. You can also feel less fearful because even the worst case scenario is probably not that bad in reality.Try to have some ideas about how you will handle a situation if it does not work out, but also avoid anticipating the worst. Try to think positive and imagine that the situation will go well. Expecting the worst to happen may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Even if they insult you, you can just walk away from the situation. They’re not worth your time.

, In interacting with these intimidating girls, you might also find that some positivity can come from it. Consider all of the wonderful things that could happen should you surround yourself with them. Perhaps you will make a new friend or you will discover that they are more like you than you thought.Remember that they may be shy and are perhaps just waiting for you to talk to them first.

, Entering into a situation where you feel intimidated can be very stressful, but you can combat this stress. Before you see or have to interact with them, take a few deep breaths. Sometimes, when there is tension, we often forget to breathe normally. Take a moment to breathe and to reassure yourself to be calm.


Breathe in deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Do this a few times until you feel calm.
You can also do a quick scan of your body to locate any areas of tension. This will send a message to your brain that everything is okay.

, In order to feel less intimidated by these girls and by anyone else in the future, it’s important to begin building your confidence. One way to do this is to identify your strengths. Perhaps you have been so caught up in thinking about the girls who intimidate you that you have forgotten about how wonderful you are. Take some time to reflect on the positives of you.Think deeply when compiling this list. Think about all of the nice things you have done for others later or the ways that you are special. Some examples of positive qualities are intelligence, beauty, kindness, humor, empathy, and ambition, but there are many more.
You can enlist the help of friends and family members to help you make a complete list. They might point out strengths that you had not considered.
Post the list where you will see it daily.

, In addition to all of the wonderful things that you are, consider all of the wonderful things that you have done. You can use the list of your strengths in thinking of your achievements. If you indicated that you are intelligent, then make a note if you make good grades as well. Think back on times that you have received awards, or praise from your parents or others.Remember that achievements are beyond your grades. Accomplishments are not just in the things that you can produce, but also in how you impact people. Maybe you are a very good babysitter or help take care of your siblings. That is important and should be noted.
Your effort and hard work are also things that you should add to this list. For example, even if you did not win first place in a track meet, all the training time that you put in to prepare yourself for the race is an accomplishment.

, People tend to feel great when they are wearing their favorite outfit, and feeling great can help you exude confidence. Take some time each day to select an outfit that looks nice on you, flatters your body shape, and is comfortable.Pick your outfit out the night before school so you don’t have to rush in the mornings.
Select clothes that are ironed and clean.
Accessorize with something unique like a cool pair of earrings or funky shoes.

, The better you feel, the more confident you will tend to be. Take care of yourself by exercising regularly and eating healthy foods. Perhaps you are intimidated by these girls because they are more physically fit than you or they outperform you in sports or gym class. This is a great way to improve yourself, get active, and boost your confidence.Don’t overdo it with exercise, however. If you are not very physically active, start small by exercising 2-3 times per week.
Don’t exercise to look like these other girls. Do it for yourself to look and feel better!

, Often times, we deal with insecurities that trouble us very much in our daily lives. These insecurities are likely why you feel uncomfortable around these girls. However, it is also important to consider which of your insecurities are rooted in real internal flaws and which are more a figment of your imagination. Often times, your negative thoughts about yourself can be illogical.For instance, if you sometimes think of yourself as being unattractive, think of all the times that others have told you that you are pretty. Also recognize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we all have traits that are beautiful and unique to us.
If you find yourself dwelling on an insecurity that you can’t seem to overcome, then you may want to see a therapist for help.

, Take some time to identify people in your life who you look up to or who have qualities that you admire. If it is possible, seek to spend more time with these people. There is a proverb that states that you are the compilation of the five people that you spend the most time around. If you spend time around people who you want to be more like, then you will eventually become more like them.Try to spend less time around people who are negative or who make you feel badly about yourself. This is a confidence killer.

, Remember that feeling intimidated is often less about those girls than it is about you. They are not taking your power away from you, but you are giving it away to them. Once you recognize that, you can begin to reclaim that power. You are much more powerful than you realize and give yourself credit for. Don’t give up your power for anyone., No one can make you feel inferior without you allowing them to in some ways. Though you cannot perhaps prevent mean things that people do or mean looks that people give, you can help how you feel about it. Refuse to let their intimidation alter how you feel about yourself. Life is too short and too wonderful to allow people you aren’t close to make you feel bad longterm.You can try repeating positive mantras in your head like “I will not let them hurt me. I am powerful and wonderful and no one can make me feel otherwise.”

, A huge part of self-value is entrenched in taking proper care of yourself. In addition to exercise and eating well, there are other practices that you can employ to care for yourself beyond just the physical. Take some time every day to do things that make you happy and enrich your spirit.


Take a nice hot bubble bath after a long day.
Read a new book or an old one that you enjoy.
Watch a movie.
Have an at home spa day. Do your nails and hair and put on a face mask.
Indulge in a favorite hobby, or start a new hobby and spend some time learning it.
Advocate for causes that you are passionate about, such as education, the environment, or animals.

, The friends you spend time with will make a huge impression on your life. If you find yourself in situations where you must be with people who intimidate you, try to add your own friends into the fold as well so that you don’t have to be alone. Though you can’t be with your friends all the time, you can still find moments to spend with them throughout your day, especially if you have class or lunch together.


You may also want to evaluate whether certain friendships are healthy or not. If they are unhealthy, then you may need to let them go.

, Self-value is also largely about recognizing the things that make you ‘you’. You are the only you on the planet and you are important and the world would be a different place entirely without you. Take some time to think about all of the things you add to the world. Think about how much your parents, other relatives, and friends love and value you. You have made their world all the better simply by existing!, Make a list of the people you love and those who love you as well. Though you are young, look at all the people you have impacted already! Keeping this list can help remind you of how important you are.

, Never forget that you deserve to be there just as much as those girls that intimidate you. Whether you are in a class with them, on a sports team, or in an organization, those things are just as much yours as they are theirs. Remember that and take up the place that is rightfully yours.


Don’t take a seat at the back of the class or move off of the sidewalk to make room for a group. Sit where you would like to sit and walk where you would like to walk without being rude.

, Perhaps these girls are some of the most intimidating people that you have ever encountered and you feel fearful to approach or talk to them. Think on others who intimidate you in life, but slightly less. Talking to these people first can build up your courage and make it easier for you to talk to the girls who are intimidating you.For instance, perhaps you feel intimidated by the lunch lady or by your older sister, but not to the point that you feel afraid or overly nervous around them. Talk to them more during the day than you normally would. You’ll feel all the stronger for it.

, It can be scary to approach girls who intimidate you and strike up a conversation with them. However, you can start speaking to them in small ways to break the ice and get rid of the allusion that you have of them as being untouchable or scary. Be sure to smile and make eye contact to indicate warmth.


Ask one of them to pass you a ball in gym class or a cup in the cafeteria.
Make a remark to them that doesn’t require a response like “the weather is so nice today.”

, One other way to make them less intimidating to you is to imagine them in ridiculous or funny situations. For instance, perhaps when you go to approach them to speak you could imagine them wearing a bunny costume or having googly eyes or anything that will make you feel less nervous about them.Be sure not to laugh out loud when you are talking to them unless one of you says something funny.

, Remember that they are not your parent, boss, or teacher and you are not required under any circumstances to say yes to them. Use the power within you to say ‘no’ if you don’t want to do something., Show these girls the kindness that you are hoping that they will show to you. Greet them with a “hello” and a smile when you see them during the day. Don’t say rude things about them behind their backs. Make sure you put into the situation what you are hoping to get out it."
"
Avoid thinking about how your peers must see you, and do what you want.,
Hang out with people from all different walks of life.,

Be a little of everything!,
Learn to see the beauty in others.,
Embrace your inner weirdo!,
Inspire others to do the same!,
Be a nice person.",How to Stop Getting Labeled As a Teen," You can listen to emo music, shop at Hollister, and read Edgar Allan Poe if that's what floats your boat. When you deviate from the stereotypes and do what makes you happy, there's only one name for you: a free thinker.;
, This teaches tolerance and awareness for people who are different from you, and it helps to expose you to all different things.

, Confidence is defined as ""belief in oneself and one's powers or abilities"".How many times have you looked in the mirror and thought ""ugly"" or ""worthless""? Probably at least once. Confidence is a gradual process for some, and so, it takes time to build. When you look in the mirror, look not for the little flaws and blemishes, but for the parts of you that you love. (You know there's at least something you like about yourself.) Know that you're beautiful and unique, even when you can't see it, and that you don't need to be like everyone else to be happy with yourself.

, If you love your black Converse All Stars, then, by all means, wear them! Same thing goes for that frilly pink dress, the baggy pants, and the Zelda Triforce tee. Wear clothing that you feel comfortable in, you like, and that shows something about you and your interests.


Shop wherever you want. You don't need to limit yourself to ""prep"" stores, like Aeropostale or Hollister, nor do you need to shop only at ""emo"" stores like Hot Topic. If you like an article of clothing, don't worry about what your friends will think when they see you sporting it; if they're really your friends, why should it matter what you're wearing?
Wear clothing with personality (yours, not the personality others think you should have)! Let your outfits reflect the real you and how you see yourself.
It's not about the way you dress: it's about the way you act. Wearing cutoff shorts and a tank top doesn't make you a ""slut"", so don't let others address you with this sort of derogatory term. Dressing a certain way is different than acting the part, so never let anyone tell you otherwise. It's your body, so others have no right to negatively influence your body image. Just remember that modesty is an important virtue.

, Whether your passion is dancing, baking, or trading Yu Gi Oh! cards, get out and do it! Doing things you love makes you a happier, better person, and when others see that you're comfortable in your own skin, they'll respect you. You should never hold back talent for fear of what others might think; instead, share your talents and interests, and maybe you'll meet people who share your interests.

, Maybe you're not ""emo"", but you still love to rock out to emo music; maybe you're not too into the ""goth"" thing, but you love Anne Rice! While you shouldn't go out of your way to ""like"" things that simply aren't you, you still shouldn't deprive yourself of things you like just because you don't want to be labeled. Learn to appreciate all sorts of things, and you'll have things in common with everyone.

, Give them the same respect and acceptance that you want from them, and you'll receive it.

, Don't be afraid to be eccentric and odd; the world needs more people like that! Share your strange ideas and express yourself.

, As humans, we're often afraid to deviate from the norm; instead, we tend to stick to it and wait for someone braver to break the cycle. Only, sometimes nobody's brave enough to step up to the plate. What happens then? It's on you. Don't be afraid to be the only one; be your own person, and others will be inspired.

, You may get judged not only by looks, but by personality. Be a good, kind friend to everyone. Nobody will ever look at you again and think ""poser"" or ""liar"" or anything. Just be sweet and be you!

Get a driver.,
Have a couple of things planned, but not the whole night.,
Don't drink or do drugs.,
Have a good group.,
Avoid legally risky situations.,
Use a house!,
Get a pool.,
Always plan for food.,
Don't be uptight.,
Don't invite hard partiers.,
Take lots of pictures!",How to Have Fun As a Teen without Getting Into Trouble," Having a driver makes things a lot easier and gives teens that little taste of being adult they crave, before they go home and the bubble is burst by parents, chores and homework. The driver could be a friend who just got their license, using mom or dad's car, a friend who has their own car, or if you're rich, get a limousine or town car. The driver is extremely important, and should be respected and treated as a crucial invitee. Why get one? Freedom! Being able to drive around town at will is far superior to any other option.;
, Plan to go to a movie or amusement park, mall, water park, anywhere you can be loud obnoxious teenagers. Loud and obnoxious behavior is an inevitable by-product of fun as a teenager even if it's good, clean fun. Also, the planned event is important because it allows for an answer to parents when they grill you on where you're going, if they do that sort of thing. Chances are, you or at least one of your friends will have parents who do that sort of thing, so they'll be able to say,""Oh, we're going to see such and such movie."" It'll make things a lot easier on that friend. Another benefit to having some things planned is the ability to scout out deals, discounts and coupons. Having extra money to spend is always good, especially since some unplanned events will almost definitely come up, so plan, and look for deals and discounts.

, As a teenager, it's more trouble than it's worth. It makes driving dangerous, leaves those who can't or won't drink or get high feeling left out, and can and does lead to addiction or overdose/alcohol poisoning. Also, as a teen, being drunk is illegal, so yeah, just don't do it.

, Make sure there's a good mix of boys and girls, couples and singles, the more singles the better, the more girls the better. Think about it. What do you call a group of all guys going out together? Nerds? Dorks? Uncool? Sausage party? Ok, now what do you call a group of all girls going out together? Loud, obnoxious, fun, cool. Also, include the driver and someone zany to push the outing in a fun direction. Most importantly, get open minded people with simple taste who find fun wherever they go. Stuck up people with high expectations or complex taste will never find fun until they're 21 and/or have a lot of money.

, No one will admit it, but when the group does something legally risky (trespassing, vandalism, drinking, etc.) anyone smart gets a little nervous and its that much less fun for them. Also, getting busted will inhibit future fun and get parents all uptight. They'll take your freedom.

, Make sure to stay at someone's house as much as possible, ideally when parents are out of the way, I.E., out for the evening or contained to a certain room. Games like pool/ping pong are always unexpected hits with a fun, open minded group. Sleepovers are awesome and reminiscing over one is a good friendship solidifying activity. Also, there are much fewer police/laws to break, in a house.

, SWIMMING IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME. Seriously, just hanging out gets a lot more fun in a basin of water, it's magic.

, Teenagers love to eat. Even those who don't admit it will later be caught devouring the chips. Its just science, the growth of puberty/adolescence requires calories. Also, hungry people are cranky people. Even if you've just had dinner, make sure there are snacks wherever you go, especially at a house. Sometimes the whole evening can even be food centered.

, This is a sure good time killer. Even if you're just being responsible, be chill about it.

, This goes back to #4, but special emphasis is needed. Don't include people who normally drink or do drugs. They'll poison the mindset of your simple group with their glorified tales of chemical experimentation. You'll notice as you progress into/through college, these people will multiply exponentially as more and more people get turned and then turn others, like a zombie plague. Keep your fun simple for as long as you can, because inevitably you'll get to that point where you're an adult and every simple get together simply must involve cocktails or beer/wine at the very least. Having sober fun in your teenage years also helps you to develop valuable fun having skills for those times when you or someone you're with can't drink or get high. In the future, you'll be a valuable friend for the guy who just had a liver transplant.

, This will provide evidence of your legendary exploits, and can be a filler activity in itself. Also, looking at the pictures of past nights out can get the fun mindset going on, provide a good talking point, and be a good way to include new people, ""Hey new guy! Check out this picture we all took in front of the big whatever at the mall.""

Make lots of friends and acquire many acquaintances.,
Balance work and leisure.,
Set aside some time each day to spend with your family.,
Remember that appearances don't make a person, but take care of what you have.,
Don't swear all the time - it brings down your mood and can make you seem aggressive to others around you.,
Don't always care about what other people think of you.,
Stay innocent by not being guilty of anything.",How to Have an Innocent Happy Life (Teenager)," A innocent, happy life is impossible for a teenager without friends. Even if you only know these people to call out their name on the street, it will boost your self-esteem immensely if you know people and they know you. Of course, don't forget to have a few close friends around you, also. Friends (if chosen carefully) can cheer you up enormously, give sound advice, and are fun to be with. Brush off toxic ""friends"" who sap your energy and make you feel inferior; they're not worth your time;
, Study enough to keep your grades at a respectable level, satisfying you and also your parents. Counteract your hard work with leisure time outside the home - it doesn't have to be expensive, the point is that you can switch off your mind for a little while. Walking the dog, going to the gym, cycling, dancing, even hanging out with friends are all great ways to switch off, and meet new people. If you are 19 and have a job, you can still maintain healthy work / life balance.!

, Talk to them over dinner, or if this isn't possible, do a little housework alongside them. You will not only develop a lifelong bond with your loved ones, but you will be more able to open up to them about your feelings and worries. Also, if you are seeking more freedom or responsibility, your parents will take your efforts into consideration. Apply this to your children, if you have any.

, Brush and floss your teeth for that winning smile, and wash yourself every day. Use deodorant, perfume or aftershave to keep yourself smelling nice. You can also workout occasionally if you feel you need to (but always consult your GP before embarking on a fitness regime). These actions show others that you care about yourself, as well as making you feel and look much healthier and happier - because let's face it, who doesn't feel better when they are clean and well-kept?

, If you have developed a bad habit of swearing all the time, then wean yourself off by recording every swear word you say each day, or limiting your ""swear count"" to a few words.

, Unless someone is in a position of authority (teacher, instructor, etc.) then their opinion of you shouldn't matter in the slightest. Many teenagers constantly worry about other people and how they appear to the world, without realising that they become self-absorbed and unappreciative of the more important aspects of life. Unless what you do or say will intentionally hurt someone else, then go ahead! Stand by your actions and your positive energy and pride will rub off on others.

, Teenagers, as well as other groups in society, are commonly involved in certain illegal behaviour. Have a happy, innocent life by avoiding recreational drugs, joy-riding, truancy, shop-lifting, carrying offensive weapons, petty theft, mugging, vandalism, trespass, cyber crime (ie downloading illegal movies or music), stalking and obtaining good through deception (e.g., buying alcohol with a fake license). Of course being innocent isn't just related to criminal activity. Be innocent of crimes against society by not bullying, not intimidating people in public by hanging around in a gang swearing and being rowdy, not littering, not wasting any public funding you are in receipt of, and not becoming a burden on society by growing up able to support yourself and anyone else who is dependent on you."

Find one action you can take in the next three minutes.,
Throw your negative thoughts in the trash.,
Tell yourself to stop.,
Shift your thoughts in a positive direction.,
Change the word “failure” into “mistake.” Tell yourself that you’ve made a mistake instead of a failure.,
Focus on the bigger picture.,
Change your definition of success.",How to Stop Feeling Like a Failure1," Sometimes, thoughts of failure pop up because you feel overwhelmed by a specific task. You might be looking at a mountain of work that seems impossible. You can't figure out how you'll tackle it. One strategy is to figure out one thing you can do within the next three minutes to take action. Then, do it.For example, your room hasn't been cleaned in weeks and it's a complete mess. Figure out one action you can take, such as picking up dirty clothes from the floor. As soon as you figure out an action, get started.;
, Write down the negative thoughts you're having on a sheet of paper. Be very specific by noting exactly what's going through your mind. Once you're done writing, ball up the sheet of paper and toss it in the trash.This exercise helps you release the hold negative thoughts have on you.

, Let the word “stop” come into your brain when the negative thoughts begin to creep in. Do not allow yourself to complete the thought, as doing so means the thoughts win. Instead, tell yourself to “stop” and then distract yourself with something else.You may feel like you have to tell yourself to “stop” all of the time. But eventually, it will become less and less.

, It’s easy to beat yourself up when you feel like you messed up. Negative thoughts might enter your mind and add fuel to the fire of what you already believe about yourself. Reframe these negative thoughts by making them more positive and realistic.


For instance, instead of saying “I always get this problem wrong,” you could say, “In the past, I’ve been wrong about this.” Changing “always” to “in the past” gives you the potential for growth and change in your mind. Your next attempt may result in a different outcome., The word “mistake” sounds less permanent and harsh than “failure.” Looking at it this way may help you feel better about the situation. Plus, when you use the word ""mistake,"" you can look for a learning opportunity.


Making a mistake also gives you a chance to grow. You can learn from what you did and use it as a chance to give yourself more information for next time., Everyone has things in their life that they want to improve. However, you end up feeling like a failure because you are overlooking the bigger picture and getting caught up on the little details. Take a step back and look at the overall picture. Is your life really that bad? Or, are you caught up on small details?For instance, you might find yourself obsessing that your crush didn't say ""hi"" or worrying about your unfinished to-do list. Allowing these small things to nag at you can make you feel bad. But, they aren’t important enough to allow that to happen.

, You may want to rethink what you believe to be success if you’re still hanging onto the beliefs you made as a child. Striving to be rich or have what you believe to be the perfect family may not be something that is achievable for you right now. Create a new definition of success and you may feel better about yourself.Sit down and make a list of what you believe defines success. Don’t just focus on material things. Concentrate on personality traits and characteristics of that nature. Now, ask yourself if this list is realistic.
If it's not, try to revise your definition with traits and strengths you have right now. For example, if you are going to school or have a job, that's a form of success. If you have a roof over your head and people that love you, that's success, too.

Call or visit someone who can take your mind off things.,
Practice visualization.,
Have a warm treat.,
Get lost in a positive activity.",How to Stop Feeling Like a Failure2," A good friend or family member can help you change your focus when thoughts of failure come up. Choose someone who is light-hearted and can make you laugh or smile.


You might call or drop by and say, ""I'm in a funk. Can you help cheer me up?""
You may even be able to take your mind off your own problems by helping this person with something. See if they could use your help with something., A great distraction technique is visualizing the order of something. This can help take your mind off thoughts of failure, and improve your mood.For example, close your eyes and imagine you are in the grocery store. Think of one specific aisle and visualize the different items on the shelves.
You can also try this trick with songs on an album or with the order that items are placed in your bedroom.

, Negative thoughts can make you feel cold and lonely inside. Comfort yourself with something warm. Sipping hot tea or taking a hot shower or bath may help to warm you up emotionally.Take your treat to the next level by choosing exotic teas or by adding scents to your bath.

, One way to overcome feelings of failure is by doing something. You'll naturally feel less negative when you exercise your brain and get in the flow of an interesting activity.Distract yourself with activities such as exercising, gardening, reading, watching a movie, making a to-do list, or practicing a sport.

Make healthy choices.,
Avoid alcohol and drugs.,
Ask for support from loved ones.,
Practice self-care.,
Seek help if a mental illness is the cause.",How to Stop Feeling Like a Failure3," Negative thoughts can influence your health and wellness for the worse. They also impact your immune system, making it more likely that you'll get sick. A self-defeating attitude can even cause you to make poor lifestyle choices like skipping workouts or binge-eating junk food.You can counteract these negative effects by making healthy choices for your physical health. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. Eat nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein, and low-fat dairy. Get enough rest each night--aim for 7 to 9 hours.

, Negative thinking can tempt you to turn to drugs and alcohol. These substances may temporarily numb painful feelings, but they only make the problem worse in the end. Avoid them in favor of relaxation exercises and self-care activities., Having low self-esteem can even harm your relationships. You may put your negativity off on the other person, blaming them for the way you feel. Counteract this problem by communicating with those closest to you and letting them know what you need.


Telling them may help them understand that you are the one with the issue, not them. For instance, you might say, ""I know I get down on myself sometimes. I really appreciate you trying to cheer me up. I need someone positive in my life like you right now."", Do something positive for yourself once a day. Focusing on a task that makes you feel good can break up those awful thoughts. You can use that time to boost yourself up instead of tearing yourself down.Go for a walk, meditate, read a book, hit the gym, or do whatever makes you happy. Purposefully doing nice things for yourself may make you feel like less of a failure.

, Depression and anxiety can cause you to feel like a failure even when there isn’t any real reason behind it. Visit a doctor or psychiatrist if you feel that this could be the cause.

If you constantly feel bogged down by an overwhelming feeling of failure, you could be suffering from depression. Other signs include feeling tired all the time, worthless, unmotivated, and suicidal. Talking to a therapist or taking medication may help you overcome these feelings of failure."

Exercise regularly.",How to Reduce Stress As a Teenage Boy," Your feelings of stress are connected to the “fight or flight” response that humans have experienced since our earliest ancestors were running away from sabre-tooth tigers. Even if modern stressors are not typically so life-threatening, your body responds in a similar fashion.When a potentially dangerous or challenging situation arises, your body releases hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which give you increased energy and focus, among other changes. In small doses, these changes can help you accomplish tasks more successfully. If you are stressed too much and too often, however, they can damage your health.;
, How do you explain to someone what it feels like to experience stress — say, when you realize the term paper that you haven’t started is due tomorrow? A pounding heart? Sweaty palms? Trouble catching your breath? An inability to focus, or perhaps instead an extreme focus? Stress is a unique experience for each person, but there are some common physical symptoms.The release of hormones in a stress reaction can cause, among other changes: an increased heart rate and breathing rate; increased blood pressure and metabolism; increased blood flow to major muscle groups (arms and legs, for instance); dilated pupils, enabling you to see more clearly; profuse sweating (to cool the body); and a burst of energy caused by the release of stored glucose (your body’s fuel).
These changes are natural and beneficial if they enable you to focus on and complete an important task (like that term paper). Feeling stressed too often, however, can have negative physical consequences.

, In the short term, after the burst of energy that stress gives you, you may feel more tired or irritable. If you experience too much stress too often, you will begin to notice more significant long-term changes in how you act and feel.Long-term effects of excessive stress in teens can include: anxiety; depression; insomnia; digestive problems; reduced immune response (more colds and illnesses); constant bad mood; trouble getting along with others; substance abuse; and self-injury.
Essentially, if you are feeling too stressed too often — for instance, if your parents are going through a divorce or you are failing three classes — you may feel physically and emotionally drained all the time., For some people, the signs of excessive stress may be too subtle to notice. Other people may willfully ignore or deny the signs, or simply attribute them to some other cause — the flu, a few bad nights’ sleep in a row, etc. Sometimes, however, you can recognize your stress by observing how other people are responding to you. If people are treating you differently or telling you that you seem different, it may be due to stress overload on your part.Friends or family may say you seem more distant, or disinterested; that you are more moody, irritable, or unpredictable; that you lash out more, or that you seem to be “beating yourself up” over every little thing; that you look tired or sick; that you aren’t as much fun anymore; or that you “just don’t seem like yourself anymore.”
Use the clues provided by those around you to help you identify whether you are experiencing excessive stress, what is causing it, and what you can do about it.

, Sometimes adults like to say that kids and teens “have it easy,” because they don’t have “important” things like mortgages and insurance co-pays to worry about. However, the teen years are a legitimately stressful time for many boys (and girls). As a teen, you are undergoing many rapid changes and beginning to establish yourself as a unique individual — and that means that causes of stress can be everywhere.


Common sources of stress for teenage boys can include: school work; peer pressure; romantic relationships; family troubles; sports and activities; body image issues; bullying; discrimination; substance abuse; and high expectations, among others., Grab a physical or digital notepad and jot down common activities, situations, or people who stress you out. Taking some time to do this kind of journaling regularly — simply writing down how you feel — is actually a good way to deal with stress on its own.The Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory is commonly utilized by professionals who deal with stress. It lists 43 common stressors by general severity, and assigns each a point total. By marking down the stressors that impact you and adding up your total points, you can get a general baseline of your overall stress level.

, Some of the stressors you deal with are unavoidable, but others can be avoided. After you have identified the causes of your stress, you can set about finding ways to ignore, change, or prevent those stressors that are avoidable.If being late all the time causes you stress, work on strategies to be on time more often. If a certain friend causes you excessive stress, reconsider your relationship with that person. If reading others’ comments about you on social media causes you stress, spend less time looking. Control what you can control to limit unnecessary stress.

, Avoiding stressors is one way to be proactive about dealing with stress; planning ahead to “nip” stress “in the bud” is another. If you become more assertive in addressing potential stressors, you can contain and limit their impact before they affect you. Try, for instance:


Getting organized. A messy living space tends to cause more stress, especially if you can never find what you need when you need it.
Learning to say “no.” People with excessive stress often accept too many commitments and can’t keep up. Know your limits.
Carving out time for relaxation. When you do reduce your stressful commitments, try to fill at least some of that time with stress-free activities that you enjoy.
Working on your problem-solving skills. If you can solve a potentially stressful issue before it fully blooms, you can save yourself a lot of time and trouble.
Surrounding yourself with supportive people. Give more of your time to friends and family who show understanding, compassion, and support for the stress in your life.

, Sometimes, a simple change of scenery can positively impact your feelings of stress. Take a walk; get some fresh air; find a new spot to eat lunch; find a different after-school hangout.


Once you’ve identified places and situations that tend to cause you stress, you can work on avoiding or limiting your time there.
Sometimes you can simply adjust an existing environment, by, for instance, playing relaxing music, introducing pleasant aromas, or tidying up.

, Stress is real, and the negative impact excessive stress can have on you is also very real. Often, the act of talking to someone about your stress can help manage or even eliminate it. Seek out a parent, a trusted friend or teacher, or a professional counselor or therapist. There are plenty of people out there who want to (and can) help; you just have to let them.If your stress ever causes you to consider harming yourself in any way, talk to someone immediately. Call emergency services or a crisis hotline. Do not be too proud or too afraid to get the help you need.If you know someone else who is considering self-harm due to stress, get help for them. Be a true friend.

, Think of the list of stressors you draw up as a list of opponents to “pick off,” one by one. You can’t conquer them all, but you can get rid of plenty of them with methodical, thoughtful planning.Start at the bottom of your list, with less severe stressors that are easier to address. For instance, if being late to school or work all the time stresses you out, develop a strategy for getting ready faster.
As you work your way up the list, the task will become more difficult. Some stressors simply cannot be overcome. For instance, you may not be able to avoid worrying about your math grade. You can, however, improve the situation by seeking tutoring, perhaps.

, Quiet, calming, thoughtful activities can help reduce your stress experience. Turn to them when you are feeling stressed out, but also use them as preventative measures, to get you in a less stressful frame of mind before a big test, for instance.When it comes to calming the mind, everyone is different. Some common options include: reading; laughing; positive-thinking exercises; deep-breathing exercises; meditation; prayer; or whatever works to calm you and help your stress melt away.

, Calming the mind and calming the body often go hand-in-hand. In combination, they can help you deal with many common causes of stress, from a bad breakup to your basketball team’s losing streak. Try, for instance:


Taking a bath.
Listening to relaxing music.
Painting.
Giving yoga a try.
Taking up a new hobby, or returning to a favorite one.
Getting outside. Take a walk. Breathe in the fresh air. Clear your mind and relax your body., Study after study has shown that most people (including teens) don’t get enough sleep, and that a lack of adequate sleep can cause a host of physical and emotional problems. Among the many negative impacts, inadequate sleep increases your stress hormone levels, even before factoring in your actual sources of stress.Everyone’s sleep needs are different, but the average growing teenager should strive for 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Try to get that same amount each night, and try going to bed and waking up at the same time each day (yes, including weekends and summers!).With adequate sleep, you will be more focused, in a better mood, and better able to deal with your stress.

, Excessive stress negatively impacts the body, and so does unhealthy eating. Maintaining a healthy diet, full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, will help you be more physically able to deal with stress, and can even reduce stress hormones and increase stress-fighting ones.People often turn to sugary snacks or other junk food as “comfort food” to deal with stress. This might temporarily reduce your stress, but will not provide any lasting benefit. Focusing on your overall health by way of a healthy diet, and dealing with your stress directly, with effective stress reduction strategies, is the better option.

, Physical exercise is not only good for your muscles and cardiovascular system, it can help you reduce your stress levels as well. Exercise can be a calming distraction, and it also causes a release of endorphins, which naturally improve your spirits.Studies have shown that exercise is one of the most effective stress-reduction techniques, including among teens. Strive to get an hour or more of exercise every day, or at very least several times per week. Try walking, running, swimming, biking, team sports, or other activities you enjoy."

Look at the situation through someone else's eyes.,
Remove absolute words from your vocabulary.,
Recite empowering affirmations.,
Start a gratitude practice.",How to Overcome Self Doubt1," Most of the time, you may be much harder on yourself than you would be on others or vice versa. Think about how a dear friend or family member would see your situation.Ask yourself whether you can look at your circumstances differently. For example, you encounter a setback while applying to college that makes you question your worthiness. How would your best friend or mother view the situation? They would likely tell you to keep pushing and not beat yourself up.;
, The words you use to describe yourself have the power to tank your self-confidence. Plus, absolute terms are often very unrealistic. Remove absolute terms from your vocabulary and notice how your feelings of self-doubt start to change.Skip words like “always,” “never,” “no one,” or “should.” These terms are rigid and unrealistic, only adding to your sense of insecurity.

, When you lack self-confidence, you can trick your brain into thinking you feel empowered by repeating a mantra. Certain words or phrases have the capacity to shift your thinking and help you believe in your abilities.For instance, you might say, “You are worthy” or “You are doing great.” Repeat these aloud for maximum impact.

, Cultivating gratitude is another way to shift your thinking in a positive direction. If you are insecure, you may focus primarily on what’s going wrong. The very nature of gratitude is the opposite—to focus on what’s right in your life. Spend some time each day in gratitude.Start a gratitude journal or log. Add two to three things that you appreciate about your day to the journal.

Nourish your body so that it can grow strong and tall.",How to Handle Being the Smallest Person in Class," Being the shortest and/or thinnest person in your class can automatically present you as a target for getting picked on. In general, certain kids are teased in school when they demonstrate a tendency to react either with sadness or anger. Ignoring those who tease you can show them that they are not affecting you; and, hopefully, the teasing will soon stop. You can even practice tease-proofing at home.


One cognitive behavioral technique studied by researchers involved kids thinking of themselves as a video game machine in which the other teasing kids are constantly pressing the buttons. The strategy teaches kids who are being teased that they have the power to ""unplug"" their machine and not allow those teasing them to get a reaction or press their buttons anymore.This technique practices three different subsequent steps for ignoring: P.Z.W. First, ""play it cool"" and try to avoid making any facial expressions or physical aggression to the teasing. ""Zip the lip"" reminds you to not respond with any verbal aggression. Finally, ""walk away"" allows you to remove yourself from those teasing you either by leaving the environment or focusing your attention on something else like completing your school work or reading a magazine.;
, They may not realize that what they're saying is bothering you. Don't be over-emotional when you do this. Simply assert yourself and stand up for your rights.


A confrontation does not mean a fight or verbal disagreement. Practice assertiveness by raising your voice and speaking clearly.You can say something straight-to-the-point like ""Leave me alone"" or ""Can you please stop it with the short jokes?"". Make these statements while standing with your chin up, shoulders back, and maintaining eye contact with the person teasing you.

, Sometimes, friends or family members may tease you gently as a sign of affection or bonding. However, if teasing in your class causes you psychological distress, meaning you feel upset or sad because of it, then you need to take the proper precautions to Stop Being Bullied.


A bully will usually pick on you nearly everyday, and this person seems to get joy or satisfaction out of your distress. Most of the time, bullies choose targets that are smaller, younger, or less socially connected than them., You may not want to involve an adult, but this may be necessary to stop the teasing before it does too much damage. Pull aside a teacher you trust or speak to your parent or guardian after school about the teasing.The adults will know the appropriate channels to go through to handle a bully., Even if you are the smallest kid in your class, you can still walk with your head held high and back straight. Demonstrating confidence can actually go a long way towards fending off potential bullies since these kids generally target those they view as weak or lacking self-confidence.Suggestions for showing confidence include walking tall and sitting with good posture. Lift your head and look those you talk to straight in the eye. Listen to music that makes you feel more confident or channel your favorite celebrity who is good at portraying terrific self-esteem., You may even take a jab at making fun of yourself. Of course, you should not make yourself feel bad in doing so. Just consider poking fun of yourself showing them that you can be light-hearted, like you don't care about what they say, and those who tease you will probably back off.


An example of using humor could include joking that a taller person is a ""giant"" when the person refers to you as a ""midget"". You could also wittily remark that you will never feel cramped in a car or airplane like a taller person. Share some other perks of being short such as those found here.

, While constant teasing is never easy to deal with, the situation may be difficult because you are ashamed of your height. Don't be. Many kids may be shorter in grade school because they haven't reached their growth spurt. Who knows, in a few years you may be towering over all of your peers.


Quiet that inner voice that cringes because you are smaller than your classmates. If you continually beat yourself up because of your size, you are doing just as much damage as your classmates who tease you., One way to start accepting yourself as you are is to play towards your strengths. There is a long list of positives to being smaller than everyone else. You just need to open your eyes to all the possibilities.


Don't think you can't play sports such as basketball due to your height. Many players over the years have excelled at this sport despite their size by using their height as an advantage.
Get ready to surprise your peers. Many of your classmates may look at your size and wrongly assess your abilities. Frequently, shorter people are faster and harder to defend. Prepare to astound your friends with your athletic performance.
Being the smallest person in your class may prove to be beneficial in some situations. Think about it: you will often have the best hiding places during hide and seek because you can squeeze into places larger classmates cannot. Plus, if you're a girl who is interested in cheerleading, being very small might allow you to function as the flyer--the person who gets thrown in the air and does all the crazy, fun stunts.

, Your entire identity should not involve how tall or big you are. If fact, some people have such large personalities that others forget about their height all together. You have certainly done well in many areas such as sports awards and extremely good grades. All of these abilities can help make you feel tall. Every time somebody makes fun of your height, know that you have things to be proud of in your life, and these will make you feel better about yourself.

, While some people will be short for the duration of their lives because of genetics or their environment, there are some things you can do to take charge of your growth and help your body at least look taller.


Promoting strong bones can help you appear taller. Drink more milk or foods rich in calcium and iron such as spinach and beans.If you are slightly overweight, getting adequate physical activity, may help you trim down a few pounds and appear slimmer and, therefore, taller. However, you should only start a weight loss regimen after consultation with your physician.

Own the past.",How to Get Over the Past1," Ruminating on the past can bring up a whole host of negative emotions, and it's important to name the things that you feel. Find ways to get in touch with your emotional angst. Try writing about your feelings or quietly meditating on the past. Consider speaking with a trusted friend or counselor.


Perhaps you feel guilty about something that you did, or you regret something that you didn't do. You wish that you had acted differently, and you cannot stop blaming yourself.
Perhaps you feel sad about something that happened beyond your control. You feel melancholy, wistful, powerless.;
, If you're having trouble getting over the past, there's a good chance that you are fixating on something that happened. Decide whether you need to get over a tragic event, an unhealthy relationship, a negative habit, or a more complex pattern. Try to understand what is making you feel the way that you feel. You may remember this thing clearly, but it might also be murky and tangled in your head. Clarify the past for yourself.

, This is your history, and there is no escaping it. Do not try to cover up the past, and do not try to run away from it. What has happened has happened, and you cannot change it. Granted, this is easier said than done. However, it is only once you face the past that you can truly grapple with it and overcome it.


Consider the freedom that comes with this reality. If you cannot change the past, is there any sense in worrying about it? Can you turn your attention to the present and the future?

Ask yourself: ""Was a person capable of using and manipulating the goodness in me the man/woman I really want in my life""?

, You've made a decision to liberate yourself from someone who was willing to trick you in order to get something out of you that they wanted.

, Then reflect on some things that you are proud of about how you conducted yourself. Give attention to that good person in you that was mistreated. Act more quickly next time you find yourself in an imbalanced relationship.

, Move on with your life, and remove any unhelpful reminders. Try to forget the person and find other people and activities to keep yourself occupied.

Keep a record of your achievements.,
Get a daily dose of motivation.,
Invite positive people into your life.",How to Overcome Self Doubt2," Self-doubt can create a chain of uncertainty if you let it. Reel in your uncertainties by focusing on your strengths, not your shortcomings. Rather than dwell on your faults, take out the time to reflect on the many successes you have enjoyed in your life. Remembering successes helps develop a “can-do” attitude that eliminates self-doubt.Write down the accomplishments of your life. Keep a running list and add to it each time you conquer an obstacle, big or small.

, Podcasts, videos, books, and movies with an optimistic perspective can help you overcome your self-doubts. What’s more, such materials often provide practical solutions for dealing with life’s challenges, so you will feel empowered to act.Find some empowering people to listen to and/or read. Turn to these sources when you’re feeling low in confidence.

, Surround yourself with people who see your value. A strong support system is an asset for your life, in general. When trying to cope with self-doubt though, it can help to spend time with people who treat you fairly and make you feel worthy. Periods of insecurity may come and go, but you’ll feel more resilient to them if you have a positive social circle.Enrich existing relationships and form new ones. Spend more time with your current friends, but also make an effort to forge new friendships by getting out more.

Set immediate, actionable goals.,
Enhance your skills.,
Seek feedback from others.,
See a therapist for chronic self-doubt.",How to Overcome Self Doubt3," Long-term goals are great, but self-doubt is likely to creep in when you don’t see yourself progressing. To build morale and keep your insecurities at bay, develop short-term goals that allow you to see more immediate results.For example, you might set a goal to double your income in a year. While this goal is motivating, it may help to create smaller goals, too. Try adding other goals like reaching a certain income within the next month. Or, strive to get five new clients in the next two weeks. Make them short-term, feasible, and exciting for best results.

, Sometimes, self-doubt creeps in when you feel incompetent in a certain area. As you work to stop self-doubt, it can help to hone your abilities in key areas of your life. You might do this by joining a professional development organization, taking a certification course, or reading books relating to your industry., Having an ongoing conversation with those around you about your talents and abilities can stop self-doubt in its tracks. Frequently, people avoid discussing areas in their lives in which they feel insecure. When you purposely bring these areas into focus, the self-doubt will gradually disappear. Plus, feedback helps you see both the positive and negative aspects of your abilities.The next time you catch yourself caught in a web of self-doubt, reach out to someone for feedback. For instance, you might say to your partner, “I feel like you are avoiding me. Have I done something wrong?”

, Whether your self-doubt is a recent issue or it stems from childhood insecurity, you must reach out for help if it’s undermining your goals.

Keep your body healthy.,
Exercise!,
Watch what you eat!,
Have a healthy mind!,
Care for your appearance.,
Be friendly.,
Get along with your parents.,
Pay attention to your studies.,
Use your common sense!,
Be sociable!,
Be confident and believe in yourself.",How to Have a Great Life As a Teenage Girl," Being healthy doesn't mean being the skinniest girl. Being extremely skinny can be unhealthy, and guys aren't attracted to it either.


Don't compare yourself to other girls at your school. If you are concerned about your weight, ask your doctor for proper health advice.
Don't go on those fad diets, like ""Hollywood Cookie Diet"" or anything like that. If it sounds fake, it probably is. Plus, you're a teenager; you're growing and not getting the nutrients you need won't make you healthier if you follow some silly extreme diet!;
, You can't be very healthy if you don't have any exercise. It's very easy, actually. As long as you're moving or on the go, you're doing fine! It all keeps you healthy.


Find ways to make the activities you're already doing a little healthier. For example, you can try doing sit-ups while you are watching TV. If you're listening to your iPod, you can take your dog for a walk and still listen to your music.
Doctors and health physicians recommend that you get an hour of exercise every day. You can make it fun, too! Invite a friend over and watch some of your mom's old Tae Bo videos while exercising along with it!
You don't have to be perfect at it, as long as your heart rate is up that's great! The best way to burn calories, however, is by running, mainly. Do you have a treadmill in your home, or a fitness center in your town? If you have a treadmill in your home, just enter your accurate weight and age and it's easy to burn calories! Just keep at a steady running pace, and you can make it more fun by watching TV or listening to the radio.
Something to keep you exercising every day is to make goals. For example, give yourself a reward after exercising each day after two weeks. Don't make it something that will ruin it, like eating a hot fudge sundae. Instead, go to the mall and buying a new shirt or pair of jeans to celebrate your healthier body!

, This may sound like the hardest part of being healthy, but really, it's not at all. One of the main things to do is eat breakfast every morning.


Do not skip breakfast to try to lose weight. If you do, your body will just use stored fat as your meal which is very unhealthy and will make you gain weight. You will also be more tired, and your brain won't be at it's best.
Some good breakfast meal ideas are sunny side up eggs, a banana and a glass of milk, cereal, whole wheat toast, yogurt, or Special K waffles with low-fat syrup, or a cereal bar. Yum! They also will keep you going for the rest of the morning until lunch.
Speaking of lunch, be wary of the cafeteria foods. The cookies and brownies and doughnuts and french fries they may have are delicious, but don't tempt yourself. A good idea for a meal is a bottled water or apple juice or milk with a chef salad. If you are still hungry, most schools have the ala carte option so you can have baked chips or a 100 calorie pack to go with it.
For dinner, you can have whatever your parents are cooking.
This is always being repeated to kids, but eat lots of fruits and vegetables. You can basically eat as much as you want of those because they're so good for you. Go to the grocery store with your parents one day and pick out a variety. Find your favorite ones! But most importantly, think about what you eat!

, Being mentally healthy is also key to being the best teenage girl you can be. You don't have to be the brainiest girl in the room, but always try your best! Also, it doesn't mean getting good grades. It's also having common sense and knowing what's best for you.

, Bathe regularly. Especially as you get older, shower every day to keep yourself looking and smelling clean. Complete this look with your clothing. Rather than wearing loose, oversized, baggy old clothing with holes and stains everywhere, take care to present yourself as clean and organized. This doesn't take much effort. Get a couple pairs of jeans that fit you, and make sure only to wear clean shirts. If you're concerned about fashion, devote a little more time to researching and shopping for the cutest, most popular outfits; however, this is not necessary.

, The best way to make friends is to be friendly to everyone you meet. Greet others with a smile and a nice ""hello."" Ask people how their days are going, and open up to them if they return the favor. Presenting yourself as a friendly, approachable person will help others feel comfortable and happy around you and will help you make friends with more people.

, Like it or not, they're going to be a huge part of your teen years, so you might as well get along with them. Don't go out of your way to disobey them or make them unhappy. Instead, obey them as much as possible, and talk to them when you have problems or concerns. After all, they've already been through everything you're dealing with, and their wisdom can be invaluable. Having a good relationship with your parents will make a huge difference in how much you enjoy being a teenager.

, One of the most important things is to always listen to what your teacher says. If you are spacing off or passing notes to your friend while your teacher is trying to explain something, you will miss out on what you were supposed to learn and not understand how to do a math problem or what pages to read in a book, etc. Or worse your teacher could call on you, and you won't know what he/she is talking about, which can be very embarrassing.


Always do your homework. Yes, it can be boring, but just work your hardest on it and get it over with. If you don't do any of it, you'll probably fail your next test on that chapter because you won't understand anything. And when you fail a test, that moves your grade down, which will show up on your report card and which will tick off your parents. See how this domino effect goes?
And it would all be because you didn't do your homework. If you don't understand it, ask your parents, or a teacher. Even during class! You may feel dumb, but chances are there will be someone in your class who had the same question, and your teacher will appreciate you asking.
As a last resort, you could ask a friend. But make it a good, reliable friend who won't go off-track with the assignment and start talking about something else. The best thing about getting better grades is that you will be proud of yourself, plus your parents will be proud too, which leads to them trusting you more and giving you a longer leash.
But on the other hand, what if you fail a test? The first thing you may want to do is rip it into a million pieces and throw it in the garbage. Don't. Your parents will find out anyway, so you might as well keep it. The next thing you should do is go over what you did wrong. Did you make a small mistake? Or you possibly didn't get it?
Make a list of questions on things you want to go over with your teacher, and he/she will respect you for wanting to responsibly take care of it. You could maybe even ask your teacher if you could redo the test, or do something for extra credit. Another thing you might think when you get a bad grade is, ""I'm so stupid the only career I'll ever get is picking up litter!."" Always remember, one bad grade on a test won't affect your entire grade. Just study more on your next test and all is well!

, Well, common sense may sound like a no brainer, because it is. You are your own person, and everyone else should respect that. Don't let anyone judge you upon first meeting you. If they do, they're not worth your time.


Also say no to drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes! They aren't cool. If someone offers it to you, just say, ""Sorry , but I don't want to mess up my body."" If they think that's lame, they're the ones who are! You are the cool one because you know how to stand up for yourself and be smart! Also, drugs and cigarettes can lead to baggy skin, big under-eye circles, and yellow-brown teeth. And alcohol can make you act like someone you really aren't, not to mention all the bad things for your body.
And remember you don't have to have sex if you don't want to. If a boy wants you to do that even though you're not ready yet, it's wrong, and if they truly care for you, they won't try to persuade you or if they do and you say no, they'll respect that and won't ask again. And if they say ""If you really love me, you'll do this"", a red flag should go up! This is wrong, and do NOT say yes! Don't do it until you're ready! Don't ever feel pressured to do things like that. You don't have to do drugs, drink, or sleep around to be cool or respected. Being cool and earning respect from others comes from being yourself. Of course, there is nothing wrong with sex, as long as it is safe and consensual.
The bottom line is that you must treat your body and self with kindness!

, The most popular girl in the room isn't the one with the thinnest waist or fairest face. It's the one who has self-confidence and is happy with who she is! It isn't that hard at all.

, If you're constantly worried about what others will think of you, you'll be too nervous to give them anything to think about. Don't worry about other people, as they're only focusing on themselves and their opinions don't really matter. Instead, do what makes you happy. Relax and have fun with yourself, regardless of what everyone else is doing.

Take action.,
Learn from what happened.,
Look toward the future.",How to Get Over the Past2," Look for a solution, or for a way to take control of your circumstances. You may find that you feel trapped by the permanence of the past. If you take action in some way, you might empower yourself to move forward. Escape the chains of the past, and find your purpose in motion. Dive back in, and do not be afraid.


You cannot fix everything. Irreversible things happen, and you can only act upon the new reality that exists in the wake of the event. Think about how you might ease the suffering of others, or make amends, or keep what happened once from happening again.

, Once you acknowledge and accept the past, you can begin to take valuable lessons from it. Study the past, and use it to guide you into the future. Be careful not to internalize bad habits and anxieties – only practical lessons. You may not be able to undo what happened, but you might be able to keep it from happening again.

, Evaluate your goals, and throw yourself into something new. Change the static energy of grief into the kinetic energy of action. Give something new the space it needs to bloom.

If you are trying to get over a relationship, consider whether you are ready for another relationship. If you lost a friend. think about ways to connect more deeply with other friends. If you regret something that you did or didn't do: look for a situation that gives you the opportunity to make the choice you wish you'd made.
You won't really get over the past until you stop thinking about it so much. Throwing your energy into something new can be a great way to stop thinking about the past. Change your focus. Reengage with your life.

"
"
Try to live in the present.,
Forgive yourself.,
Change the way that you talk about the past.",How to Get Over the Past3," Indeed, you are always in the present, but it can be easy to let your mind wander back into the past. Learn to consciously choose where you place your attention. Notice when you are fixating on the past, and force yourself to turn your gaze to what is around you in this moment. Check yourself.


Consider whether ruminating on the past is useful for you. When you replay the past, your mind only has a finite number of memories to relive. Your thoughts run in loops, and it is easy to wallow in your emotions – but you have a choice in the matter!, If you are beating yourself up about something that you did or didn't do: remind yourself that you did what you could. You were acting on the information that you had at the time, and you made your choice as the result of a specific set of circumstances. You might make a different choice now – but that was the choice that you made then. You are human, and it's okay to make mistakes.

, Whenever this thing from the past comes up in conversation, try not to complain or wistfully reminisce about it. The way that you frame something dictates the way that you interact with it. Instead of talking about the negative, unchangeable aspects of the situation, try to talk about what you've learned. Share the bright side, and see how that shapes your perspective.

Accept that freedom has a cost.,
Put distance between yourself and those who bring you down.,
Surround yourself with kind people.,
Say please and thank you.,
Figure out what makes you happy.,
Find a hobby or two.,
Think about starting a new career.,
Less is sometimes more.,
Step out of your comfort zone.",How to Find Freedom in Your Life,"   Whenever you make changes in your life you will have to deal with the pros and cons. You might need to leave friends or family behind while you strive to achieve your freedom. You might have some hard times and emotional struggles but in the end freedom is worth the cost.;
, It might be people who play a big role in your life, your family, teachers, boss, etc. An atheist may feel trapped if their family is strictly catholic, students often feel stuck when their grades start falling. These are examples of stressful social situations. If you cannot create peace with a person or group of people, move on without them.

, Introduce yourself to that one girl you always see smiling and opening doors for others, start hanging out with people you trust, and in return be a good friend as well. Even if you don't have a lot of common interests its good to have at least a few really compassionate people around in case you need a friend.

, Even if it sounds like something a mother might say to her child, people with manners really do go farther in life. Plus if you make someone else smile, chances are you will smile as well. Showing good manners also make for great first impressions and will make people less shy to introduce themselves to you.

, And when I say happy, I also mean inspired, comforted, or at peace. Find at least three things that make you smile and try to surround yourself with those things. If animals make you happy, get some pictures of animals and put a bird feeder in your yard. If you're a band geek put up posters and quotes from your favorite artists. Also make sure you have something to play your music. Be creative and unique.

, Hobbies are the best when you are the only one you know who does that hobby. Start hula hopping or recycling things to can find at garage sales. Keep a journal that you write one sentence in every hour on the hour, first thing that pops into your head. Do something worth having a conversation about.

, A lot of people feel stressed out about their job or wish they could be their own boss: and you can! Either getting a new job with a friendly manager or becoming self-employed can help make work less taxing on your happiness.

, Maybe the reason you feel trapped is because you have so many responsibilities and obligations that you can barely keep up with your life. Its healthy to keep busy but remember to make time for yourself.

, Do something you never thought you would be able to do. Do something you can be proud of. Call up that pretty girl you met the other day and ask her out, start eating healthy, face your fears. Make small, achievable goals and then just make them a little harder every time. You will be shocked at what you can accomplish.

Control your thoughts.,
Focus on the physical advantages.,
Consider the practical benefits.,
Remind yourself what you like about others.",How to Deal with Being a Short Male1," It’s much easier said than done to change the way you think. That said, it’s possible to push away negative sentiments by reminding yourself that perceptions of personal shortcomings are just that - perceptions. To start doing so, try to be more aware of your cognitive behavior. This means recognizing and identifying your thoughts.For example, when you think negatively about your height, you’re betraying a cognitive bias that is leading you to focus on this single physical attribute. Call your mind out, and redirect your thoughts!
It’s worth seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist to help with being aware of your thoughts. They will help you use mindfulness to catch yourself in negative thought processes and replace them with positive, more worthwhile thoughts.
Try to identify and write down where your ideas about being short came from. Pinpointing the source of your thoughts can help you to question their truthfulness.;
, Though it may not always feel like it, there are some definitive advantages to being a short male. For one, you likely build and retain muscles more easily. There are other potential physical advantages as well, such as quickness and agility that can benefit from a lower center of gravity.And don’t forget, attraction is a purely subjective phenomenon. Some potential partners will absolutely prefer short men, just like some people are attracted to guys with beards or bald guys.
Along with physical advantages, short men tend to have more stable marriages, lower cancer rates, more active sex lives, and longer lives overall., Aside from strength and agility, there are other tangible benefits to being short as well. For instance, you will likely have an easier time staying comfortable in many contexts, including airplane seats and smaller vehicles. While these may not seem like important considerations, it's worth acknowledging the fact that there are always relative advantages for people of any height.

, Think about what you like about other people. In particular, think about what makes you enjoy spending time with certain people, and value the relationships you have with them. Chances are, you didn’t worry too much about their height.On the other hand, think about what others probably like about you. The fact of the matter is that whatever reputation you’ve developed has much more to do with your behavior than your stature.
If you're consistently bummed about your height, it may help to write out all of the attributes you like yourself. Don't limit the list to just physical attributes. As you look the list over, think about which factors are the most important to you.

Get your clothes altered.,
Buy “made to measure”.,
Wear pants at your waist.,
Accessorize to complement your body type.,
Wear darker colors lower.,
Wear vertical patterns.,
Get a jacket with the perfect proportions.,
Avoid shorts and short sleeves.,
Consider getting shoe inserts.",How to Deal with Being a Short Male2," Tailored clothing helps people look their best, and is the easiest way to immediately up the quality of your wardrobe. Clothes are designed for average height people, and designed to accommodate multiple body types. Accordingly, your pants and shirts may be too long, or may be sewed in a way that makes them fold in odd spots.In particular, get your pants hemmed - it will not only shorten the legs, but make the pants fit better on your whole lower body.

, You can also purchase clothing made to fit you perfectly. This is especially worthwhile for button-up shirts, which will almost always need to be altered or custom made to fit you well. On the topic of dress shirts, opt for short, downward-pointed collars.For online options, Modern Tailor and Blank Label are retailers that specialize in making clothes to fit your specific measurements.

, A longer leg line from a longer pant leg will help make you appear taller. Though many popular styles of pants are worn on the hips, this risks making your legs look stocky. To emphasize a lengthening look, wear trousers without belt loops and wear suspenders.Get a high quality pair of dark, well-fitting jeans. Opt for a pair that fits your form, avoiding a baggy or tight fit. Boot cut jeans are especially good for shorter legs, as they add silhouette to your body without adding boxiness., Watches, jewelry, and neckwear can help tie an outfit together. Choose particular items in proportion to your body type. Big watches belong on big wrists and stocky arms, while slim, short men look especially good in slim ties., Here’s a simple style rule to follow: always keep darker colors lower on your body. A dark pair of pants and a lighter colored shirt will make you look taller, while a dark shirt and light colored pants risk making you look shorter., The classic example is vertical stripes, which have a slimming effect. Consistently-spaced, thin, vertical stripes without much room in between are ideal. Of course, any texture that is vertically oriented will have similar effects. Accordingly, opt for corduroy and herringbone patterned materials for heavier weighted clothing., Most importantly, avoid jackets that have extra space in the armpits. This may be the case even if the sleeves are the right length, and will make you look heavier. This is because the proportions of the jacket are not designed to fit your body. When shopping for a suit coat, work with a tailor who can make you a jacket or make the necessary alterations on a store-bought jacket.Shoot for about ¼ inch of shirt cuff showing beyond the end of your jacket sleeve. This is proportional to a shorter arm length. Opt for thin collars and lapels too, for a lengthening effect.

, Simply put, shorts and short-sleeved shirts will make you look shorter. This is in part because short men usually have relatively short appendages, and these types of clothing will draw attention to them. Linen pants in hot weather, as well as long sleeved-shirts (even with the sleeves rolled up), are preferable., Shoe inserts are purely a matter of personal preference. They can subtly add height, but may be uncomfortable or otherwise bothersome. You can also try wearing cowboy boots or another type of footwear with heels that are higher, per the style of the shoe.Avoid shoe inserts in high-heeled shoes, like many types of boots. The combination will tilt you forward too much.
Shoes designed to add a few inches to your height are usually not the best option, as they will be noticeable.

Pause to let an insult wash away.,
Stick up for yourself.,
Ignore the haters.",How to Deal with Being a Short Male3," One unfortunate aspect of being a short male is that people may mention it a bit too often. These comments have more to do with the speaker's insecurity than they do with you. Next time someone mentions your height and it bothers you, pause a moment, remind yourself that they’re acting immaturely, and see if you can simply let it pass., Sometimes, a response is warranted. The type of response, however, is up to you. Usually, refusing to acknowledge a tasteless comment is the best route. However, if the comments continue, it’s best to confront the person in a direct, non-aggressive way.Perhaps the best way to do so is by looking them in the eye and asking, “You’re not trying to offend me, are you?” This provides them an out to laugh it off, while sending the message that you don’t appreciate their comments.
It is often completely fair to say something like, “Hey, I can joke about height with the best of them, but this is getting kind of old. Will you stop cracking jokes at my expense?”
Most importantly, stay calm, and avoid responding with insults of your own.

, Again, this is easier said than done. That said, if there’s someone in your life to whom your height seems like a big deal, it’s likely worth addressing. Say something like, “It seems like my height is a big deal to you. It’s not to me, so I’d prefer it if you quit bringing it up.” If they don’t get the message and insist on viewing you in terms of your height, you may do well to avoid them altogether."

Figure out what you want to do right away.,
Use your coping skills.,
Talk to someone and get support.,
Consider getting therapy.",How to Deal with Emotional Stress at a Young Age1," Make sure you have a plan to both help reassure you when the situation comes to a head and something you can fall back on if needed.


If you don’t know much about stress, you can educate yourself about the feeling.Stress often happens due to thoughts that you cannot deal with what is happening. Bad thoughts that may lead to stress are, “I can’t do this. I don’t have enough time. This is too much!”
Use your problem solving skills. Identify possible solutions to your issue that is causing you stress.When feeling stressed, use the STOPP method: stop and take a step back, take a breath, observe (what are you thinking and feeling?), pull back (look at the situation as an outside observer), and practice what works.;
, Stress is normal, especially for people at this age where everything seems to be crashing in. It’s confusing and difficult, but you can get through this. Use coping skills that help you feel positive emotions such as happiness or excitement.Distract yourself. Distraction can be a helpful way to cope with stress. It gets your mind off of what you are worrying about and gets you to focus on something else.Try playing a game on your phone. There are many that are available for free (such as Candy Crush).
Go on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, etc) for a few minutes, but don't spend too much time focused on it. If you start comparing yourself to others or have a negative conversation with someone, stop yourself and do something else that makes you happy.
Text message a friend and set up a time to hang out.
Get out in nature. Being near nature may help kids cope better with stress because it may help them focus their attention, which can feel like a mini-vacation.Listening to music can help calm you down and reduce distress. Use creative activities to deal with stress such as painting, drawing, and writing.Give yourself a break. Try your hardest and be the best you can be, but take breaks when needed. You need time off to recharge, too., Having someone to talk to is essential when you are emotionally stressed or have any kind of stress.Social relationships help us deal with stress because it makes us feel like we have someone else to help us if we need it.It doesn't matter whether it's a friend, teacher, counselor or a trusted adult.


If you feel comfortable talking with your friends about your stress, you can message them online or send them a text message. If you can, set up a time to talk with them face-to-face. Your friends can be a great source of support because they might be able to understand what you are going through. They might be dealing with the same emotions you are!
Tell the person how you are feeling and learn to identify your emotions. Some examples of emotions that are similar or sometimes combined with stress are feeling: overwhelmed, anxious, worried, fearful, sad, and depressed. All of these emotions can coincide with feeling stressed. Use I statements like, “I feel stressed when I think about this math test I’m going to take.”
You can ask for help on an issue, and try to solve the problem by getting more ideas from someone else. You can ask for help by saying, ""I'm so stressed, what do you think might make me feel better? Can you help me?""

, Many youths have a difficult time with stress and it is normal and okay to get therapy as a young person. If your stress causes you to have extreme emotions or to engage in risky or harmful behaviors (such as coping with food or self-inflicting pain), therapy or other treatment may be useful in order to develop healthier ways to deal with stress. Therapists are typically professionally trained in ways to reduce stress (such as relaxation techniques and psychological interventions).


Talk to a school counselor and ask her for a referral to a therapist. Or, you can ask your parent to contact a psychologist or therapist to set up an appointment.
Think about taking medicine if it's necessary. Sometimes emotional stress gets the best of you (even when you're young), so you may need to go to the doctor. Talk to your parent or guardian if you think you may need medication.

That's what makes us different. If we were all perfect, we wouldn't have a very diverse world. Just a bunch of perfect people. So feel GOOD about your flaws, because they make you different, which is a beautiful thing.;
, They can REALLY put you down. If they call you names or manipulate you, you should: Tell an adult (be careful about this, you could be called a tattle-tale), Shrug it off, Laugh it off, Change the subject (don't do this- ""You're SO weird, and your hair is greasy and you have a bunch of bald spots, so- HEY! You know that new kid in Mrs. Ram's class?"" It will be obvious you tried to change the subject.), or just plain ignore them. But NEVER EVER EVER EVER snap back at them! It only makes it worse. Just look at them for a few seconds like you didn't hear them, and look away.

, If booty shorts make you feel uncomfortable, why wear them? If you feel good in capris and a cute flowy top, then wear that. If you feel good in skinny jeans, then wear them! Have you ever picked out an adorable outfit at your house, and wear it to school. Did you feel that it was sort of ugly or to weird afterwards? Well what can you do?

Sometimes spending too much time on social media (Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, Vine, Twitter, etc) can lead to comparing ourselves to others and feelings of jealously or low self-esteem. If you feel negative emotions when you are online or on social media, try taking a 15 minute break (or more if you can do it) and focus on doing something positive (such as drawing, talking with a friend in person, or riding your bike).
Use positive self-talk, such as, “I have been successful with my efforts in the past. If I put my mind to passing this test, I can do well.”Have a positive attitude by changing your bad thoughts.Some examples of bad thoughts are, “I am going to fail. I can’t do this.”Try to think different thoughts like, “I am going to try by best, and I know I can get through this.” See the difference? Say the happy thoughts to yourself when you are feeling stressed.
Focus on what you do well instead of what you do wrong.You could draw a flower, and on the petals write positive things about yourself or what you do, like: I am loving, I tried my best, and I am nice to animals.Avoid saying bad things out loud. Stop using words like “won’t,” “can’t,” “always,” and “never.” Try instead to use the words “will,” “can,” “most of the time,” and, “not very often.”

, Mindfulness meditation can help lower stress over time.Mindfulness is about focusing on what you are doing or feeling right now.Stop and notice what is happening in this moment.


First, notice the feeling you are experiencing. What does it feel like in your body? Does it feel tense, is your heart beating fast, do you have butterflies in your stomach? Next, name the emotion. Are you stressed, overwhelmed, anxious? Then, accept the emotion as natural and normal.The more you accept your emotion the less power it will have over you.You can say to your emotion, “I accept you, stress. Even though I don’t like how you feel, I know that you may happen sometimes and I will learn to deal with you.”
Try using bubbles to practice deep breathing. This can help to calm you down. Try to slowly blow one big bubble; this helps you learn how to use your deep breathing in a fun way!

, Writing down your feelings and thoughts can help you work through your problems and get your emotions out instead of keeping them inside of you.Find a clean paged notebook or diary to write in and write down what you are feeling.
Write a letter to the thing that is bothering you such as a math test. Tell the math test how you are thinking and feeling as if the test were a person. You could write something like, “Math test- you make me so stressed out, but I really want to get a good score.”
If you don’t like to write you could draw a picture that shows how you are feeling.

Focus on the health of your body and mind.,
Get good sleep.,
Exercise.",How to Deal with Emotional Stress at a Young Age3," If we are not feeling well physically or mentally, this could increase the amount of negative thinking we have. Exposures to high levels of stress over time can increase the risk of certain diseases and health conditions (such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes).So, it is important to take care of yourself especially during difficult times.

, Quality of sleep can help reduce stress.If you are having trouble sleeping first look at what might be bothering you. Is it too cold or too hot? Is it too noisy? Try to fix these situations first.If you are 8-16 years old you may need about 9-10 hours of sleep per night.If you are older than 16, you may need at least 8 hours of sleep per night.

, Exercise is a great way to increase positive emotions and distract yourself from negative thinking. It changes your mind and body to make you stress less.Some of us may have difficulty getting our exercise in because we are so focused on our phones and social media (Instagram, SnapChat, Facebook). Try putting your phone down for just an hour a day (maybe hide it in your room) and do something active instead.
Try fun activities like: dancing, playing handball, basketball, jumping rope, or skipping.
Exercise is more fun when you do it with other people. Invite a friend to go swimming, biking, or skateboarding.
If you have access to a game console (such as a Nintendo Wii), you can play active games like bowling or boxing with yourself or your friends.

This can be hard for tall kids, especially if you are tall and skinny. When shopping for clothes, make sure the sleeves and legs are long enough, but the clothing fits close to your body.If you just can't find clothes that are long enough without looking oversized, bring some pieces to a tailor for custom alterations.;
, One easy way to de-emphasize your height is to create a visual barrier between the upper and lower halves of your body. You can do this with a contrasting belt or by wearing a different color on top and bottom., If you feel like you have lanky arms, add a little extra bulk by wearing layers and pushing up the sleeves on the top layer., There are certain items of clothing that look best on tall people, so take advantage of what you have. Tall people tend to look very good wearing these items:Maxi dresses
Tall boots
Skinny jeans
Skirts that fall just above the knee
Waistcoats and vestsDouble-breasted jackets., While there is absolutely no reason that you should not wear something just because of your height, it's important to be aware of the kinds of clothing that may make you appear even taller than you are. If you don't want to look tall, avoid wearing these items:Tops and bottoms that are the same color
Vertical stripes
Heels
Miniskirts
Calf-length pants or shorts
Bold prints, People who feel uncomfortable about their height may be prone to slouching. This not only looks bad, but it can cause back pain. For the best posture, keep your shoulders comfortably back. They should never be raised towards your ears or rounded forward.Be careful not to hyper-correct. Your shoulders should not be so far back that you would not be able to stand with your entire upper back against a wall.

, Just like slouched shoulders, walking with your head down makes you look like you are not confident, and it can cause you pain. Try to hold your head up straight so that your neck is not bending forward or to either side. You should be looking directly in front on you, not at your feet!A good way to tell if your head is straight is to take notice of your chin. It should be parallel to the floor for ideal posture.

, You should have a slight arch in your lower spine. To find out if your posture is proper, stand against a wall so that your head, shoulders, and bottom touch the wall and your feet are a few inches away. If you can just barely slip your flat hand behind your lower back, your posture is ideal.If you have too much or too little of an arch, make a conscious effort to correct it. Pulling your abdominal muscles in can help straighten your back.

, While arm and leg posture is not directly related to your height, they are essential to overall good posture. Having your arms and legs in the correct position while walking will make you look much more confident.Your arms should hang freely by your sides as you walk.
Your legs should be about the same distance apart as your hips, and you should distribute your weight evenly on both feet. Be careful not to lock your knees.

, Most kids grow up to be around the same height as their parents, although it is possible to be shorter or taller than your parents. There is absolutely nothing you can do about your height, so it's best to just accept it as something that makes you unique and wonderful.Keep in mind that just because you are the tall kid now does not mean you will always be tall. If you started growing sooner than your peers, they may very well catch up to you soon.
Although it is extremely rare, some children do have disorders that cause them to grow more than normal. If you are concerned about your height, talk to your doctor about it.

, Although it may make you feel uncomfortable, it's important to keep in mind that a lot of people would probably love to be as tall as you are. It has certain advantages, too. The next time you're feeling down about being tall, remind yourself about all of the things you can do because of your height:


You can reach things on high shelves.
You can see over people's heads at the movies and at concerts.
You can go on all the rides at the amusement park.
You may have an advantage in basketball.
You may have a better chance of becoming a model.

, A lot of kids get bullied or teased at some point in their lives. Sometimes it's for being too tall, sometimes it's for being too short, and sometimes it's for not discernible reason at all. The important thing is to try to not let it bother you and to maintain your confidence.If you do encounter a bully who teases you about your height, try your best to act unaffected. Bullies tend to pick on people who lack confidence. If they think you're not phased by their comments, they'll probably leave you alone.
It's a lot easier to stand up to a bully when you have a buddy with you, so try to stick with friends whenever you think you might encounter a bully.
If you are being bullied, you don't have to handle it alone. Let a parent or teacher know right away.
You can respond to a bully by simply walking away and not acknowledging the negative comment at all. If you feel like you must say something, keep it short and simple. You can say something like, ""Leave me alone"" or ""That's not very nice,"" and then remove yourself from the situation. Getting argumentative or emotional will probably only make the situation worse.

, Having a good attitude can really help you feel better about yourself! If you have negative thoughts about yourself because of your height (or anything else for that matter) make a conscious effort to replace those negative thoughts with positive ones.Pay more attention to your thoughts throughout the day. Whenever you have a negative thought about your height, remind yourself about all of the positive aspects of being tall.
Try not to say (out loud or otherwise) anything to yourself that you wouldn't say to another person. You should always be kind to yourself, even when you feel like criticizing yourself.
Spending time with positive people can help a lot too. Try to surround yourself with friends who will not make fun of you for your height and who have good self esteem themselves.

Recognize that your size is not the problem.,
Respond to bullies or others who mistreat you for your size.,
Get help from others.,
Move confidently.",How to Cope With Being Small1," Know that others who have insecurities about their own size or appearance are the ones to criticize or bully and create a problem out of your size that you would not otherwise have.


Understand that other people may treat you badly about your size because they have also been mistreated, they think it is normal or acceptable because of their other interactions with peers or family, or because they see smaller size as being less desirable from TV shows, movies, or the internet.Imagine that no one made comments about you being small or otherwise mistreated you for it. Would you still have a problem with your size? This may help you to see that it is other people creating the problem, not your small size. Are there things about your small size that you like?;
, Let people know when they say something about your size that you don’t like, rather than quietly accepting it.


Deal with bullies or other criticizers as kindly as possible, without resorting to calling them names or getting angry, as this may only encourage them to repeat their insults.For instance, to someone who pats you on the head and makes comments about your size, you can kindly ask them to stop. To anyone who says negative things about how small you are, you can calmly explain, “Actually, I really like being this size” or “Actually, I’m small because of a medical condition, so please don’t make fun of me for it.”
If you feel you cannot safely talk back to a bully, or someone threatens you with physical violence or other serious attack, go to a parent, teacher, guidance counselor, police officer, or any person you trust for help right away.

, Ask for help from someone you trust if you cannot get through to someone who is offending or hurting you with speech or actions regarding your small size. Always notify the police if someone physically harms you or threatens to do so.


If you are a child, go to a parent, teacher, guidance counselor, or other adult you trust and explain the situation to them.
If you are an adult, talk to a friend, a mentor, a therapist, or the HR department of your job if it is an issue with a colleague.Find a friend or even a celebrity or other role model who is also small as another source of inspiration, guidance, or even an example to use when talking to others.

, Avoid negative comments from others by showing confidence in your actions. Stand tall with your chin up and don’t be afraid to take up space in a room when you’re walking, standing, or sitting.


Showing physical confidence has the additional benefit of adding size to your appearance. Averting your eyes to the floor, feeling dejected, and not wanting to take up space all manifest in your body appearing even smaller with drooping shoulders, head, etc.
Make and hold eye contact with other people, stand still with your feet squared toward someone you’re talking to, and walk and speak slowly and steadily. This is all subtle body language that communicates confidence."

Follow your doctor’s recommendations.,

Exercise to build muscle.,
Accentuate height with clothing.",How to Cope With Being Small2," Talk to a doctor if you are concerned about an inability to gain weight, grow, or if you already know you have a condition that inhibits these things.

Eat protein from food like meat, eggs, and nuts. Focus on complex carbohydrates from foods like rice, whole wheat, and potatoes. Get healthy fats from olive oil, coconut oil, and avocados.

Make sure you check out fitness videos and instructions for home equipment, and get guidance from gym staff or a personal trainer, to ensure that you have proper form when using any weighted equipment.
Strength training workouts should consist of 8 to 12 repetitions each of 8 to 10 different workouts that target all different areas of your body. Do this type of workout at least twice a week to begin.Ask your doctor before beginning any new workout routine. Also keep in mind that you don’t need to work out to reach a particular goal or gain significant size; exercising can simply make you feel good and achieve overall health.

, Wear clothing that fits you well and has long, straight lines to help accentuate your height and flatter your small frame.


When shopping women’s clothing, try looking for flared pants, vertical stripes, and v-neck tops to elongate your body.Note that high heels can make you look and feel temporarily taller, but you may want to work to embrace your own size as it is.
When shopping men’s clothing, try outfits that are monochromatic, and choose slim cuts on shirts and pants. V-neck shirts are also a flattering choice.Smaller women can shop in the “petite” section of many department stores, while men can shop brands like Peter Manning to find clothing that fits well without further tailoring."
"
Join a sport like gymnastics or wrestling.,
Fit into small spaces.,
Stand out from the crowd.,
Save money on child’s sizes and discounts.,
Enjoy correlated health benefits.",How to Cope With Being Small3," Ask about how you can join a team through your school or a local club that’s accepting new players. There are many sports and activities that small individuals in particular can excel at.


Join a sport like wrestling, boxing, martial arts, dance, gymnastics, weightlifting, horse racing, and positions within other sports for which small size is an advantage or necessity.
Smaller individuals typically do well in these activities due to a lower center of gravity and/or increased ability to move the body easily and quickly.

Move through crowds more easily as a small individual, and others may also allow you to stand in front of them at concerts or other events where you might have difficulty seeing over taller people.
Fit into more compact spaces and have more legroom on planes, in cars, or other forms of transportation that typically do not have much personal space.
Play hide-and-seek or other games for which you may be able to conceal yourself better than other players.

, Embrace your size as something that sets you apart from others, which you will appreciate more and more as you get older or as you try to define yourself in a particular industry or group.

You can stand out from others of average height pursuing the same thing, and even build a personal brand around your unique size., As you grow out of childhood, enjoy some of the advantages of continuing to appear young, which can get you child discounts and other perks.


Shop in boys or girls sections of clothing stores, as both a way to find clothes that fit you better and save money on the cheaper garments.
Ask about discounts for children or younger people at museums, movie theaters, and other event locations. Even if you do not fit the maximum age, you may be able to pass for younger to meet the discount requirements.

, Know that people of short stature are actually found in studies to also enjoy a number of other health benefits.


Benefit from a reduced risk of cancer as a result of smaller size, which may be due simply to the fact that shorter individuals have fewer cells in their bodies, or have lower energy intake.

Potentially live longer as a short person, as the hormone that controls height also governs aging."

Check the ergonomics of your favorite places to work or study.,
Store frequently used items where you can see and reach them.,
Reach lightweight objects overhead with a grabber, hook, or tongs.,
Climb safely.",How to Cope With Being Small4," Many desks and chairs are built for some average height person, so they might not fit you too well.


Choose an office or task chair which fits you. It should, ideally, adjust low enough for your feet to rest flat on the floor. Also check the depth of the chair. Your knees should fold over the edge while your back is supported. Armrests and lumbar support should, likewise, be able to be adjusted so they suit your height.
Adjust the height of your office chair to a height which fits you.
Make sure your feet rest comfortably on the floor when you're seated. If they don't, or if you must raise your seat to match too high a desk, place a footstool under your feet, or improvise another object, such as a ream of paper, box, or old book.
Adjust the height of your desk, bench, or other work surface. If the work surface is not adjustable, as in the case of most kitchen counters, you could either choose a lower work surface (such as the kitchen table) or raise yourself. An aerobic exercise step is a good, sturdy place to stand, with the option to adjust the height.
Adjust the height of your monitor or screen. Your eyes should be level with the top, or about three-quarters of the way up. Many modern screens have a height adjustment built in. Otherwise, look into getting a monitor arm or wall-mount.
Get and use a keyboard tray, if necessary, to lower your keyboard and put it at an angle which keeps your wrists straight and relaxed.
Try a smaller keyboard and mouse, if your hands are smaller. They may be sold as ""portable"" or ""travel"" devices.

, Choose lower shelves for the items you use most often.

, Try a long-handled tool for tasks such as cleaning high places, hanging holiday lights, and changing light bulbs.

Evaluate how you talk about your body.,
Pay attention to how she talks about her body.,
Help her find a passion in life.,
Give her the tools to succeed.",How to Foster Positive Body Image in Young Girls," If you are a mom or a young girl’s role model, how you refer to your figure translates directly to how the young lady will view her own.


Stop dieting. Even if you need to lose weight, avoid using the phrase, “I’m on a diet, I’m fat or not eating right now” around a young girl. She will certainly pick up on the fact that you are struggling and will transpose those thoughts onto herself.
Exercise for fun. Although you may not view hitting the trail as a blast, young girls should see adults working out for enjoyment. Find an exercise you actually do enjoy and invite her to work out with you. Discuss the benefits of working out in terms of how exercise elevates mood, reduces depression, lowers stress levels and improves brain function.
Talk about your body in terms of health. Instead of flippantly saying that you want to be skinny, talk about how you want to be healthy. Your goal shouldn’t be to get into a size two, but instead to be within a normal weight range. You should also want to be healthy in order to avoid certain diseases and to maintain a high energy level.;
, You’ll be able to tell if her body image is already distorted or if she has a positive view of her figure.


Focus on her academic, scholastic or creative talents. Instead of focusing on how she looks, look toward what she can do. Coach her on talents and skills, encouraging her to further her interests and increase participation.
Help her make wise decisions about food, however reinforce the reason why making healthy food choices is wise. Focus the conversation on health, not being skinny. Explain how healthy food reinforces the brain and muscle functions, which will help in every aspect of life (such as school, sports and any other achievement).
Direct her towards helpful role models instead of ongoing tabloid or teen TV viewing. Identify women who have made great strides based on their talents and achievements such as women in business, politics and the arts. Use role models a young girl may relate to as well. For example, while Mother Teresa may be considered to be a wonderful role model, a 10 year old girl may not be able to relate.

, Girls who are involved in activities such as sports, academic clubs or the arts are going to be more focused on honing their craft than looking for fat on their thighs.


Provide an opportunity to try new activities. If she wants to take tap dancing lessons, find a local studio and sign her up. Offer to help with the girls’ soccer team or be involved in the math club. Make sure she has the opportunity to be part of something where she shows an interest.
Let her know that not everyone finds their passion immediately. Sometimes it takes going to five different clubs or teams before she finds her love. Let her know if she doesn’t click with the first activity, she should try something new when the activity wraps for the season. Although she should try multiple activities, avoid offering to let her quit mid-season. Make sure she finishes what she started before embarking upon something new.
Introduce her to one of your passions. If you are a skilled painter or a doctor, take her to work with you and let her see this skill through your eyes. Not only will this allow you to bond, but may open a new world to her.

, If you buy junk food and lay around all day you are sending a mixed message. If she wants to feel good about herself you must not prevent her from succeeding by imposing possibly your bad habits or agreeing that everyone should be healthy but still keeping ice cream in the house.


Enlist the entire family in a “get healthy” initiative. Even if the boys in the house are rail thin and can eat a pack of Oreos in one sitting, don’t continue to purchase them--junk food benefits no one, no matter your body type. Instead, include the entire household in a healthy living lifestyle and only keep healthy food in stock--for everyone.
Work out together. If she isn’t playing a sport, offer to make a goal of working out four days a week--together. If she isn’t already active, offer to walk with her every morning either before or after school. Just start with one mile and work up to more every few weeks. Working out together will give her more motivation to be active--plus it will help you too if you haven’t been hitting the gym either.
Consider therapy if you see there’s a problem. From air brushed magazine covers to young actresses putting their health at risk to be thin, girls today are bombarded with the image that being thin is the only way to be accepted. If you’ve tried working with her and she continues to obsess and be concerned with her body, consider speaking with a professional about other ways you can foster a positive image. There may be underlying issues you may not know to address, however a professional can help uncover and deal with deep rooted problems.

Wear a bra that doesn’t show through your clothes.",How to Cope With Wearing a Bra at a Young Age1," Wearing the right size of bra will go a long way to making you comfortable about the prospect of wearing one. Grab a measuring tape and measure yourself:


Wrap the measuring tape around your chest against your ribs. Don’t pull it tight but it should rest snugly without slipping down.Write down this measurement in inches. Round up to the nearest inch. Add 5 to this number. This will be your chest or band size (size 32, 34, 36, etc.).;
, Wrap the measuring tape around your breasts at the fullest part. Again, don’t pull the tape tight. Rather, it should rest snugly without slipping down.

Write down this measurement in inches. Round up to the nearest inch. This will be the number you’ll use to calculate your cup size (AA, A, B, C, D, etc.) in the next step.

, Proper cup sizing is important so that you don’t wear something too small where your breasts don’t fit and spill out the sides. You also don’t want to wear something too big, because the bra can sit uncomfortably. To calculate cup size:


AA: if the band size and cup measurement is the same, you are an AA cup size.
A: less than 1” difference between band size and cup measurement.
B: 1” – 2.5” difference between band size and cup measurement.
C: 2.5” – 3.5” difference between band size and cup measurement.
D: 3.5” – 4.5” difference between band size and cup measurement.
DD (E): 4.5” – 6” difference between band size and cup measurement.

, Bras can feel very different when you try them on and when you wear them all day. Try on a few different types, such as a sports bra, a cami, and a regular bra with cups to see which will be most comfortable. Buy a couple of different options and test them out when you’re at home. Which feel most comfortable to you?


Try a sports bra, especially if you have smaller breasts. Sports bras do not usually have separate cups, and they are usually more comfortable than regular bras.
Try an underwire bra if you have larger breasts. This type of bra can provide more adequate support.
Try a tank top with a built-in bra. Ease into wearing a bra by choosing a tank top that has a built-in bra. You will look like you’re wearing a tank top only. Layer another shirt over the tank top.
You probably don’t need to bother with a push-up or padded bra. These will usually make your breasts look bigger and can draw unwanted attention to yourself. Padded bras can add a bit of extra shape, however.

, Don’t draw unnecessary attention to yourself with a bra that can be seen through your clothes. Skip the dark-colored bra when you’re wearing a light-colored shirt. Instead, go with something neutral-colored.


Wear a bra made of fabric that isn’t too thin. Otherwise, your nipples might show through.
Try on your shirt over the bra to see how it looks. You might have a decoration on the bra that could stick out under your shirt and be noticeable."

Walk away, if possible.,
Let him know the comment was unacceptable.,
Make it clear you will not tolerate this again.,
Allow yourself to feel anger.,
Find someone to listen.,
Report continuous bullying to an adult.,
Seek out others who share your values.,
Remember you're not defined by your body.,
Find ways to boost your confidence.,
Love yourself.,
Try to understand the boy's perspective.",How to Cope when a Boy Calls One Fat," If you hear a comment about your weight, the best thing to do is often to walk away. Bullies thrive on getting a reaction. If you show the boy you won't be intimidated, he may stop.Act as if you didn't hear the comment. Then, continue on your way without offering any reaction.
You don't have to ignore the comment on an emotional level. It's okay to get sad and vent to someone later. However, pretending not to react in the moment may make the boy avoid bothering you in the future.;
, The comments may not stop in the future. You also may be in a situation where you can't walk away. In this case, it's appropriate to calmly explain the comment was unacceptable in the moment. It's never okay to talk about someone's weight, especially in such negative terms.Let the boy know you don't appreciate that kind of language. Say something like, ""Calling someone fat is not acceptable language and it's a form of harassment."" Bullies are often never called out on their behavior, which is why they feel it can continue.
Even if you're very upset, try your best not to come off as angry when addressing the bully. The boy wants to know he upset you, and anger will show him as much. Use an even tone of voice rather than raising your voice., You need to make sure you assert yourself when dealing with a bully. After you tell the boy the comment was unacceptable, lay down some basic boundaries. Bullies often target people who won't stand up for themselves. If you show you're willing to address someone's bad behavior, you will be less likely to be a target for a bully in the future.Passive aggressive requests may not be taken seriously. They may also give the boy a chance to shrug off his behavior by saying something like, ""I was only joking. Relax."" Do not say something like, ""Can you maybe not say that again? It kind of bothers me.""
Instead, be clear. Say something like, ""Do not talk to me like that again. I'm not going to continue to have contact with you if this keeps happening.""

, While you should not respond with hostility, as this will encourage the boy, do not repress your anger entirely. It's important you allow yourself to feel what you're feeling inside. The boy made a hurtful, inappropriate comment and you have every right to be upset and angry.You deserve to feel the feelings you have. Anger is not a bad emotion. It can often help us identify negative behavior as well as our personal boundaries.
If you're feeling angry, acknowledge this. You can even express in a calm way to the boy (for example, ""It makes me angry when you talk to me like that.""). However, make sure to control your anger enough that you can express yourself clearly.

, Afterwards, you should find a caring friend or family member to share your feelings with. It's never okay to be called ""fat"" and you will need help processing your emotions. Find someone to rant to after the incident.Pick someone you know is empathetic and a good listener. Someone who's somewhat emotionally absent may not be of much help.
You should also choose someone you feel comfortable with. If necessary, you want to be able to yell, cry, and express other strong feelings.

, If you keep getting harassed by the boy in school, tell someone. If he's picking on you, chances are he's picking on other students. Bullying can have very negative consequences and you should speak up when you see it happening.Try talking to someone at your school you trust. You can talk to an empathetic teacher or principal, or even a teacher's assistant or student teacher.
If you don't feel comfortable going to someone in your school, you can talk to your parents. Let them know what's been going on and have them speak to someone at your school.

, When someone calls you fat, you may feel very alone and alienated. It can help to find likeminded people. Fostering new relationships, or strengthening existing ones, can help you feel better after being bullied.Try joining a club that caters to your interests. You can, say, join the Yearbook staff if you're interested in writing. This will help you meet people who value art and writing as well.
Being around people who share your values makes you feel less alone. It will remind you not everyone judges you based on your weight.

, It's easy to get caught up in negative thoughts about your body when someone calls you fat. In the aftermath, remind yourself that you are not solely defined by your body. There is so much going on inside of you that matters more than your physical appearance.Think about all your capabilities, skills, and talents. Think about your identity deep down, focusing on the positives of who you are as a person.
It's important to remember these things cannot be taken away from you, no matter what comments people make about your body. Remember you are more than your physical being.

, If you're feeling bad about yourself, look for ways to boost your confidence. You can work on improving a hobby or skill, developing a new talent, or getting physically active. Even if your goal is not weight loss, physical activity can have a positive impact on your overall mood.If you choose physical activity, try not to make the focus of your workouts weight loss. This may make you feel worse. Instead, think about how impressed you are with your body's strength and everything it can do.

, It's easy to obsess over a negative comment about your weight, especially if you're already insecure. This can have a big impact on your self-esteem. In order to build up your self-esteem, think about things you like about yourself and practice self-compassion.Write down a list of your best talents. Maybe you're a great writer. Maybe you're a talented swimmer. Think about these things instead of focusing on your weight.
You should also focus on positive aspects of your personality. Remember, it's what on the inside that counts. Think about your best qualities. You can even make a list of things you like about yourself. For example, ""I'm caring, I'm a good friend, I'm a good listener,"" and so on.
Try writing a letter to yourself from the perspective of a friend who loves you unconditionally. Imagine that you have a friend who loves you unconditionally. What might that person put into a letter to make you feel better?Imagine how you would talk to a friend. How might you talk to a friend who had just experienced what you did? What might you say to make a friend feel better? Try to talk to yourself in this way., It can be hard to empathize with someone when they hurt you. However, it can help to try to understand what the boy was going through. The boy may be unhappy on his own end, causing him to lash out in other ways.Think about the boy in question. Do you know anything about his personal situation? Maybe he has a troubled home life. Maybe he simply seems on edge in school a lot.
His comment may not be about you. While it was inappropriate and you have a right to be upset, he may be acting out because he's hurting in other ways.

Praise your teen.,
Correct gently.,
Ask their opinion.,
Teach them that they won’t always get what they want.,
Help your teen separate what they can change and what they can’t.,
Avoid emphasis on physical appearance.",How to Build Self Esteem in Teenagers1," A good way to boost your teen’s self-esteem is to let them know when they have done something well. You may think your child knows you are proud, but they may not. Tell them more often that you are proud of them, that they have done a good job, or that you appreciate their efforts.Don’t overdo the praise. If you praise too often, it may sound like you don’t mean it, which could have a negative effect on your teen’s self-esteem.
For example, you may say, “I am very proud that you brought your grade up in math” or “Your guitar playing sounds wonderful today!” or “Thank you for taking out the trash. I really appreciate it. That was a big help.”
It is also important to acknowledge the work your teen has done, while emphasizing that their pride should come from within. For example, you might say something like, ""Wow! You have so much detail on this section of your project. I can see you must have spent so much time getting it just the way you wanted. You must be so proud of the work you did."";
, Be mindful of the words you use to correct your child. You want to teach your child how to accept constructive criticism, but don’t want to say hurtful or discouraging things to them. When your child is wrong or didn’t do something completely right, tell them in a constructive, positive way to help keep their self-esteem intact.For example, you may want to say, “Those notes are still giving you trouble, but you are improving so much. Before long you’ll have it” or “If you study hard for your next exam, I know you will be able to get the answer.”
When correcting behavior, try I statements. For example, “I would like you to wash the dishes when you get home instead of playing video games” or “I would like for you to take your shoes up to your room and not leave them by the front door.”You can also try mentioning something your teen did well and then ask them for more help with something else. For example, you might say, ""Thank you for folding the clothes. You folded the pants so well. I see you worked hard on the shirts. Next time try folding the shirts this way so there are less wrinkles.""

, Being included in family discussions and decisions can help your teen feel worthy and important. Ask your teen their opinion on things, including trivial and serious matters. Feeling like they have a voice makes them feel like their opinion matters and they have a role in the family, which can improve their self-esteem.For example, you may say, “We are thinking about going on a vacation this summer. Where do you think we should go?” or “We want to reorganize the house. Do you have suggestions of things we can change?”

, One way to help your child have more positive self-esteem is to teach them to accept the word no. No one gets what they want all the time. This is no reason to get angry, frustrated, or throw a fit. It is a normal part of life. Help them learn to take this in stride instead of getting upset.Help your children learn to ask for or suggest things instead of demanding them.
Try to be empathetic towards your child while still maintaining the limit as well. For example, you might say, ""I know it's disappointing not to get what you wanted. I know that feeling.""

, Helping your teen see the difference between things they can and can’t change can help protect their self-esteem. Encourage them to try to accept what they can’t help instead of looking at them like flaws.For example, your teen can’t change their height, so help them accept this. Tell them to look at all the different heights of people. Help them understand height doesn’t impact who you are or what you do.
Encourage them to do something about things they are unhappy about and can change. This may include getting to a healthy weight, studying more or getting tutoring, or joining new clubs to make new friends.

, While it’s important to teach your teen good hygiene and how to take care of themselves, you shouldn’t place importance on the physical body and their looks. Instead, help them place worth on character, intelligence, kindness, humor, and deeds.Try to limit the compliments you give your child about their looks. Give them as many compliments about other things as their appearance. For example, compliment your child’s effort and accomplishments instead of looks. You can also pay your child compliments about their positive traits, such as their honesty, caring attitude, and generosity.

Find something your teen excels at.,
Encourage volunteer work.,
Suggest your teen get a job.",How to Build Self Esteem in Teenagers2," Teens can build self-esteem by pursuing hobbies and interests. Encourage your teen to try new things. Just the act of getting out of their comfort zone by trying a new activity can help boost your teen’s self-esteem by making them feel more confident and secure in new situations.If your teen has talked about wanting to try something, help them be able to try that. You may want to hold off on spending a lot of money on something, like equipment and lessons, until your teen decides they are serious about the activity and it’s not a passing idea.
Look at community events that offer classes in painting, music, or crafts. Get a membership to the Y and let your teen try a variety of sports.

, A good way for your teen to build self-esteem is to find an activity they are good at. This can be anything from school to sports to the arts. Everyone has a talent, and when your teen discovers that talent, support them and help them find ways to get better and share that talent.Just because you may not understand the activity or think it’s pointless doesn’t mean your teen does. Accept your child’s talent no matter what it is, even if you don’t like it.
If you teen loves working on cars, consider encouraging them to get a part time job so they can buy an old car to fix up. If your teen loves to write, encourage them to create stories and poetry and submit them to teen literary magazines.

, Another way teens can build self-esteem is through service to their community. Volunteer work can help provide your teen with a feeling of accomplishment and purpose. Feeling like they have a place in the community and have done something to make it a better place can improve their self-worth.Your teen may be able to find volunteer opportunities through school. Many school organizations participate in service for the community.

Religious institutions may provide volunteer opportunities.

, Learning responsibility and making their own money can lead to stronger self-esteem and feelings of worth. When your teen gets a job, they learn practical skills and are held accountable. When they succeed, this can make them feel good about themselves. Encourage that your child get an afterschool job.Many places hire people 16 and older, and some places will hire a 15 with parental permission and a work permit.

Remind them not to listen to their inner critic during this time.Your teen may have trouble identifying that they have positive attributes. If they are struggling, help them come up with ideas. Ask questions that lead to them coming up with positives.
For example, you may say, “What activities do you enjoy? Are you good at that? What do your friends like about you? What characteristics do you think are your strengths?”

, Buy your teen a new notebook and encourage them to keep a self-esteem journal. This journal is their private space to write about their accomplishments, compliments, successes, new experiences, and progress. Encourage them to spend five minutes each night writing about the day.Your teen can write down positive thoughts they have or times during the day when they felt good.
Give them prompts, such as, “My accomplishment today was…,” “I had a good thought about myself when I thought…,” or “Today was good because I…”

, If your teen’s self-esteem is significantly impacting their life or causing depression and anxiety, you may want to suggest they go to therapy. Therapy can help your teen talk through issues, figure out what is causing their negative self-esteem, and how to cope and move past it.Your teen may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on replacing negative thought patterns with healthier ones. Your teen can learn how to stop thinking negatively about themselves and think in a more positive way.

Accept yourself.,
Acknowledge that no one is perfect.,
Accept mistakes.,
Emphasize positive characteristics.,
Set goals.",How to Build Self Esteem in Teenagers4," Everything you do affects your teen. This means that if you have low self-esteem, talk negatively, or are overly critical, your teen may internalize this. To help your teen with their self-esteem, accept yourself for who you are. Even if you have negative thoughts about yourself, keep them to yourself around your teen.Model acceptance by saying things like, “I excel at…,” “My positive attributes are…,” and “I accept my faults for what they are.”

, Low self-esteem sometimes stems from a need to be perfect. Many teens compare themselves to others and see only the outside, which they think is this wonderful confident person, and feel bad in response. Help teach your teen that no one is perfect, and that is okay. Focus on the importance of trying and doing their best instead of being perfect.Some parents are afraid if they show their children that they are faulted or wrong sometimes that it will negatively influence them. Letting your teen know it’s okay to be human can help them have a healthier sense of self.

, Many people with low self-esteem see mistakes and failure as the ultimate crisis. Teach your teen to accept mistakes and failure as a part of life. Everyone fails, everyone makes mistakes, and they will fail many times during their life. Help them learn from their failures and see them as stepping stones towards their goals.In some instances, you can even celebrate failure. Let your child know it’s okay not to do excel at everything.

, Encourage your child to focus on their positive characteristics over their supposed faults. Help them learn to silence that inner critic that says they aren’t good enough. Teach your teen that they have many positive attributes that makes them a worthy person, so they should train themselves to think in a more positive light.Help them understand that negative attributes or supposed faults are not something to dwell on. Everyone has them, and they are more than their faults.
This means you may need to change the way you talk about yourself and others.

With practice, we can get better.”, Setting goals and following through with them can help make your teen feel good about themselves. Model good behavior by setting your own goals and sticking to them. Encourage your teen to set concrete goals, and praise them when they stick to their goals.For example, your child may want to follow a regular exercise program, eat a healthier diet, practice their instrument, or follow a study plan. Help them set those goals, and suggest that they keep track of their progress.

Write down your talents, skills, and good qualities.,
Challenge yourself to do more.,
Stop comparing yourself to other people.,
Set goals for yourself.",How to Build Confidence (for Teen Girls)1," It is easy to focus on the things that you do not like about yourself or the areas that need improvement. When you focus on the negative, you forget about all the other wonderful attributes you have. It is important that you acknowledge the things that you are good at and make time to do those things.Examples of good qualities you may have include being smart, funny, kind, generous, creative, loving, caring, etc.
Talents and skills you may have include being an athlete, dancer, musician, writer, artist, poet, singer, volunteer, etc.
How much time do you spend doing these any of these activities? How will you make these activities part of your everyday life?;
, A lack of confidence can stop you from trying something new or doing something that you enjoy. What would you do if you had more confidence? What is stopping you from doing it?

Write down the following sentence, ""If I had more confidence, I would...""
What type of support or encouragement would you need to try this? How would you feel if you actually tried this?
For example, maybe you are a good writer and would like to work on your skills. However, you are not confident enough to write for your school newspaper. You may write, ""If I had more confidence, I would join my my school newspaper. I know that I am a solid writer, but I am afraid of other people reading my work. If I joined the newspaper, I would become a better writer and make new friends.""

, Every person has strengths and weaknesses. These are different for each and every girl. When you compare yourself, you are often comparing a weakness you have to someone else's strength. If you continue to do this, you will never feel good about yourself.When you find yourself comparing yourself to another person, direct your attention back to yourself. Remind yourself that you are unique and have your own strengths and talents.
Go back and read the list of positive attributes, talents, and skills that you made. It may help to post the list by your bed or on your bathroom mirror.

, There may be areas that you would like to improve upon or things you would like to accomplish. When you achieve things, you prove to yourself that you can meet expectations. Setting a goal and achieving it can help build your confidence.

Write down your goal and then write down steps you can actually take to achieve it. Your goals and the steps you take should be realistic. Setting a goal that you are unable to reach may backfire and make you feel worse.
For example, if you want to start running, running a 5k is a better goal than running a half-marathon. Trying to go from not running very often to running a half marathon is a huge jump, and you are setting yourself up for failure. A 5k is very realistic, and you can find a couch to 5k running program to help you set your daily and weekly goals.

Recognize negative thought patterns.,
Question your negative thoughts.,
Counteract your negative thoughts.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Use self-affirmations.",How to Build Confidence (for Teen Girls)2," The way that you think about yourself affects your confidence levels. If you constantly say negative things about yourself, you will begin to believe them. These thoughts are often more damaging than the things that other people may say to you.


When you begin to feel anxious, sad, depressed, angry, or upset, stop and reflect on the thoughts you are currently having.You can also wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap the rubber band each time you have a negative thought., Instead of accepting the negative thoughts you have about yourself, challenge them. For example, If you ever tell yourself, ""I can't do anything right,"" or ""Nobody likes me,"" challenge those thoughts instead of believing that those things are true. Ask yourself some of the following questions to determine if your thoughts are true.Why do I feel the way you do?
What do I think about myself in this very moment?
What is the evidence for and against my thinking?
Can I find out if my thoughts are really true?
How else can I look at this situation?
Will this matter in 5 years?
Does this way of thinking help me achieve my goals?
Can I learn anything from this situation?

, Once you recognize a negative thought, you must replace it with a more positive, realistic thought. This may be difficult at first. However, the more you do it, the more positive your thoughts will become.Instead of saying, ""I flunked my test. I am a complete failure,"" say, ""I didn't do great on this test, but I can prepare better next time. I will ask my teacher for some extra help. I know I can do this.""
Instead of saying, ""That guy doesn't like me. I must be ugly or a loser, "" say, ""That hurts my feelings that he doesn't like me, but that doesn't mean that no one else likes me. I'm a great girl. I will be able to find someone else who is interested in me.""

, You are probably harder on yourself than you are to your friends and family. Accept that you will not always get things right, and you will make mistakes. That is part of being human.If you make a mistake or go through a hard time, ask yourself what you would tell your friend. Now apply that same kindness and compassion to yourself.
For example, if you friend did poorly on a test or lost something important, would you tell your friend how stupid or forgetful they were? If your friend did not make the volleyball team, would you tell your friend that they were a loser and should have never tried out in the first place?

When you exercise, it helps you become more confident about your body while relieving pent-up stress.Pick a physical activity that you enjoy doing, so this doesn’t feel like a chore. It can be anything from skateboarding to shooting hoops to line dancing.

, You may not be able to control everything that’s happening with your body, so it’s important to take charge of those things that you can control. Take good care of your body, and keep yourself feeling well by getting enough sleep and eating nutritious food.For instance, pack a lunch instead of eating fast food. Start opting for fruits, veggies, nuts, and/or whole grains instead of junk food when you’re craving a snack.
Making healthy choices also means avoiding drugs and other substances that negatively affect your physical and mental health.

Make eye contact.,
Stay visible.,
Smile.,
Fake it ‘til you make it.",How to Be a More Confident Teen1," Making eye contact with another person is a great way to convey confidence.It also shows you are friendly and approachable. People will treat you with more respect if you are able to look them in the eyes.


You don’t need to stare at them intensely. That can be unnerving to the other person. It’s okay to look away every once in a while.
Keep practicing. It may feel weird at first to look at people’s faces (instead of your shoes), but keep at it. It will begin to feel more natural after some time.
Practice making eye contact with people you are most comfortable with, like your siblings or your friends, and move on to more challenging targets (your teacher or your crush).;
, Resist the urge to hide behind your hair or curl up in a ball. Confident people have body language that indicates they deserve to be there, that they are strong and in control.Keep your hair off your face. Tuck it behind your ears or pull it back if you need to.
Don’t slouch. Not only is it bad for your posture, but it makes you appear unapproachable and insecure.Stand up straight with your head up and shoulders back.
Sit tall. Don’t hunch forward or lean back in your chair. Put your hands in your lap or on your desk, don’t cross your arms in front of you.

, A genuine smile makes you look better and friendlier, but did you know it also helps you feel better? Studies have found that even forcing yourself to smile can boost your mood.And if you are feeling happier, you will most likely feel more confident, too.


Smiling makes you look more approachable, more comfortable, and can even make you more memorable., Sometimes the secret to being confident is to pretend to be confident. Eventually your acting will begin to feel less like acting and more like real confidence. Pretend you’ve got confidence and eventually you may realize you do, and in fact have had it all along!For example, you may feel intimidated in a class because you feel surrounded by smart people and struggle with the material. What if you pretended to be one of those smart people? Sit up straight, raise your hand with confidence and contribute to the conversation. As you begin to act differently, you will find that your teacher and classmates treat you differently.

, Set realistic, attainable goals so that you aren't let down if you can't accomplish everything at once. Take it one step at a time and think positive!

,, Wash your hair often (enough for your hair type) and bathe yourself often. Don't get too obsessed every minute on how you look. One of the important things about being confident is being comfortable with yourself and your body. Be mindful of wearing clothes that are too revealing or too small for your body type, as they can be unflattering. If you feel the need to, carry simple things with you like a small hairbrush, lip gloss/chap stick, and a small bottle of body spray.

, Buy what you like to wear and what makes you happy. Don't wear anything just because a certain crowd is. If you like the normal jeans and t-shirt look then, it's totally you. As long as you're comfortable, you'll become confident. Follow your own standards.

, And never be scared to do the right thing.

, Being unique and confident is all about your personal uniqueness. If you like wearing jewelry, go for it! If you don't like wearing jewelry, that's your personal taste and no one should tell you otherwise. Your hairstyle, hair color, shoes, purse and other accessories are other ways you can personalize your look. Like jewelry, these things are not for everyone and you shouldn't do it if you don't feel comfortable with it.

, A clean room means that you can find what you need when you need it, so you aren't stressed out because you lost something. You will also feel better when your friends come over if you can show them a clean room. Nobody wants to see your underwear on the floor!

,, Study for tests, do homework and all assigned reading. Answer questions in class and ask questions relating to the topic. Don't be afraid if you still don't understand what you're learning, talk to your fellow classmates or talk to your teacher. You can't pass your classes if you don't ask questions. Being smart is not weird. People who think so are not smart.

, If you have a swearing problem, make up your own ""swear word replacements"". Instead of saying the 'F-word', replace it with the word ""frick"" or ""fudge."" A simple word replacement is always better than the actual swear word. If you can, eventually eliminate these slang terms.

, If you're good at dancing, take up a class and polish your skills; if you're good at sports, take lessons and join a team.

, It can boost your confidence level, help you develop your social skills, and help you make some friends.

, If you love music, go ahead and don't be afraid to whip out your IPod or CD player (If the time is important of course) Read books or write poetry if you love it. Paint, draw, swim, or watch Anime if it's your personal thing. Everybody has different hobbies and there's nothing wrong with expressing it. Remember: It's all about what makes you happy, not doing it because someone else wants you to. Find things you're passionate about and don't be afraid to try something new.

, If you feel your friends have less respect for you, talk to them. Let them know how you feel, tell them how you expect to be treated, and offer solutions. If someone makes you feel bad or not good enough, they are not your friend and you should dump them immediately. .

,, Don't be afraid to say ""no"" if the situation calls for it. Example situations would be if a friend asked you to help them cheat or copy off of your homework.

, Embrace differences in others and celebrate diversity.

,, As a teenager, you're growing up, but you also have to respect your own boundaries and limits. When the time comes, you'll know and you'll be much happier that you waited until you were ready.

, These are one of the biggest problems as a teenager. Drugs are not a good thing in the first place and it is preferable that you don't do it at all. It can do serious damage and ruin your good reputation. Don't go out and get drunk. First off as a teenager, you're underage. Second, getting drunk can be dangerous, you can do things you'll regret.

, Don't give into high school stereotypes like being a prep, emo, or punk rocker. Your own style is what you make it. If someone calls you a poseur, brush it off. # Think positive! Don't feel pressured to look exactly like a model or celebrity. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and if you think you're beautiful, then you are beautiful!

, If someone calls you a mean name, shrug it off, however, if someone compliments you, take it in. Think about it.

, Not only will it make you happy, but it will also make someone else feel good that they did something nice. They also might become your friend.

, or, ""Look at me...I look beautiful today.""...you could grab a chair and sit in front of the mirror, and state all the good things about you, the things that make you a beautiful girl just the way you are. Don't compare yourself to a movie star.

, If you don't take care of yourself, your emotional health, you could make bad decisions that you'll regret later. Tell someone if you're scared or upset and that you want help to make yourself feel better.

Have friends you trust.,
Share your feelings with others.,
Find a supportive community.,
Listen to your elders.,
Get involved in school activities.",How to Be a More Confident Teen2," You don’t need a huge group of friends, so do your best not to stress about popularity. You just need a few close friends you are able to confide in, have fun with, and connect with.Make sure you are comfortable talking to your friends. You want to have people you can turn to when you need support or a listening ear. You also want to be able to trust that they won’t spread your secrets around.If your friendships are too full of drama or backbiting and often seem like they are more trouble than they are worth, you might want to distance yourself from these people and look for new friends. For example, friends who love you one day and give you the silent treatment the next are probably not worth the angst they are bringing to your life.
Don’t ditch your good friends for other friends who make you seem more popular.

, Expressing your emotions can be tough sometimes, but being able to do so indicates confidence and helps to boost your self-esteem.Speaking up -- for your own feelings and for others’ -- can be scary, but it is another one of those things that gets easier with practice.


If you feel self-conscious about sharing your feelings with others, think about a time when someone disclosed some tough information to you. For example, what if one of your friends confided in you that she was struggling with depression? Would you judge her for being weak or laugh at her? Most likely, you would do your best to comfort her, relate to her, and let her know you were glad she reached out to you. If you have friends you trust, they will probably react the same way.
Think about situations when you might need to express your emotions or stand up for yourself. For example, imagine you have found out that your friend is saying mean things about you behind your back. Letting them know how it makes you feel (angry, sad, or disappointed in them, for example) indicates to your friend that you find their behavior unacceptable. Your friend knows you won’t put up with that kind of treatment, and will hopefully not treat you like that again in the future.
When you are expressing your feelings, try saying “I feel hurt that you didn’t include me,” rather than “You never invite me to hang out after school.” The first sentence conveys hurt, while the second sentence is accusatory and will have the other person feeling defensive.

, Have people in your life who’ve got your back no matter what. Having a community of people who you can rely on to support you will help you boost your confidence. You have a safe place to fall back, and a safe place to be yourself, in a group of people who care about you.


You may find this group of people in your extended family, faith community, or athletic team, for example.
If you do not feel like you have a group like this in your life, you could consider joining a religious youth group or a scouting group, for example. You want to find a group of people who value support and inclusion, perhaps with adult leadership that enforces these values.

, Trusted adults or older members of your family can offer you advice and perspective on what you are dealing with. As difficult as it may be to imagine, they were once teenagers themselves, dealing with problems similar to what you face today.


Adults can help you realize you are not alone in your feelings. Not feeling like you are the only one to go through this helps you feel more confident that you are normal and on the right track.
Ask your parents or grandparents what they were like when they were your age. What were their worries and concerns? Find an adult you can trust not to sugarcoat adolescence and ask them to paint a realistic picture of what life was like for them as a teenager.
You could ask, “Dad, you’re always telling me about the fun stuff you did in high school. Do you remember it ever being not fun, or even really hard?”

, There are so many ways to connect with your peers. Sharing a common goal, project, or vision will help you become closer to others, as well as help you become more confident in yourself in all you can accomplish.


Join an athletic team. Whether you get involved in sports in your school or your community, athletics are a fantastic way to build self-esteem and self-confidence.You will make friends and enjoy the camaraderie of a team, as well as get in great shape and improve your self-esteem.Perform. Getting up in front of a group of people to sing, dance, play an instrument, or act can take a lot of courage sometimes. If you can survive opening night nerves, it often feels like you can accomplish anything! Performing an artistic talent for others can be a huge confidence boost.Join a club. Find a group of people with a common interest in a school club or in your community. Maybe you are into robotics, outdoor adventuring, or film. Whatever your interest, you will likely find opportunities to get to know others in your school or community who enjoy similar hobbies. Making new friends and having new social opportunities can increase your confidence.

Volunteer. Get involved with a cause you support -- animal rights, the environment, fighting homelessness -- and become an advocate for it. You will gain confidence with your knowledge and by using your voice to help those who may not be to use theirs."

Be authentic.,
Be honest.,
Try new things.,
Keep a journal.,
Remember that everyone else feels the same way that you do.",How to Be a More Confident Teen3," Don’t pretend to be someone you are not in order to be liked by others. This does not convey confidence; rather, it indicates insecurity. This is easier said than done, of course, but here are some suggestions to help you be who you are:


Be comfortable in your own skin. Embrace your inner nerd (or band geek, or jock, or hippie) and love what you love. Nothing shows confidence like a person enjoying who they are.
Have a sense of humor about yourself. If people are making fun of you for being involved in all the school plays, for example, you can laugh and say, “Yes, that’s me! The drama queen!” Add a dramatic gesture for increased effect.
Don’t pretend to be someone you are not. Not only will people be able to figure it out, but you will feel miserable.
Trust your intuition. Listen to that “gut feeling” that gives you the sense that maybe you are not doing what is the best for you.For example, your discomfort around hanging out with a boisterous crowd at the football game is not a personal failing. It could be your intuition saying, hey, this isn’t your scene.

, Tell the truth about who you are and the mistakes you’ve made. Making yourself vulnerable and sharing the “real” you can give you confidence. People will be impressed with your strength in sharing your feelings, which may help you feel good about yourself. You will see others accepting you in spite of your “flaws.”You’ll also see that sharing your vulnerabilities is not the worst thing in the world; in fact, it can often help grow relationships with others. You will find that the people who matter most will most likely accept you for who you are no matter what.
For example, say you feel upset about your dad’s remarriage. You could say, “I feel like I am going to be left out of his new family.” While your friends may not be able to relate to a parent getting remarried, everyone can relate to the feeling of being left out. This statement gives others the opportunity to share their own experiences.

, Adolescence is the time to figure out who you are.Give yourself permission to try something and fail. You’ll realize that if you fail, it’s not the end of the world.


Make a point to do something that you have always wanted to do, but it is also something you find daunting or even terrifying! For example, you could ask out your crush, perform in the school talent show, or make your un-athletic self join the track team.
It might be hard and frightening, but think of the sense of accomplishment you will have. Also consider how much easier it will be to do the scary thing again.

, Writing in a journal is a great way to keep track of your feelings, work through your problems, and watch yourself evolve. You will look back on previous pages and see how the thing you thought was such a huge deal really wasn’t. You’ll learn to not sweat the small stuff.


You’ll get to know yourself better -- self-awareness boosts confidence.You’ll also have a personal record of your life as a teenager to keep as you move into adulthood. Looking back on it as an adult may help you empathize with younger generations one day!

, Being a teenager is not an easy time. You are figuring out your identity, exploring new freedoms, and learning about the world… and so is everybody else! Take confidence in the fact that your feelings and struggles are normal.


Be gentle with yourself as you navigate adolescence. Give yourself permission to make mistakes and not know everything. Remember, no one has it all figured out (that goes for adults, too)!
Don’t put unnecessary pressure on yourself to know who you are or what you want to do with your life. Learning who you are is a lifelong process. It won’t happen overnight, or even in your teens. Be confident that you are normal, and that you’ll find your own answers in your own time.

Each morning before you go out into the world, take the time to do the mirror technique.Stand in front of the mirror with a straight posture and your shoulders pulled back. Take a deep breath. Smile at yourself. Notice characteristics about yourself that you admire. Do you love your eyes? You new lipstick color? Your trendy hairstyle?;
, If the statement playing on a loop in your head is negative, you will feel bad about yourself or lack confidence in your abilities. Positive statements empower you to become the person you long to be.

Examples of mantras can be quotes or lyrics from songs that reflect your core beliefs, or they can be simple declarations such as ""I am enough."" or “I am not who I’m going to be. I am always becoming.""

, If you lack self-confidence, you need to take a moment and think about your strengths. Sit down and create a list.

, Research has shown that blacks often progress through several stages in a racial identity model in which you first view whites as being better and yourself as being inferior until the last stage where you internalize your culture and reap a great deal of self-esteem and confidence. Getting a thorough understanding of your historical and cultural background can help you to assimilate your feelings about race into a positive self-identity.


You can read books and listen to inspirational speakers that explain all aspects of your culture. You can also talk to elders in your family and community who share your racial background to glean their perspectives.

You can be whoever you want. Like what you like. Country music. Poetry. Hunting and fishing. Fashion. TV or books.


Feel free to explore likes and dislikes. It's not disloyal to change your favorite food, musician, movie, animal or whatever else by the hour if you want! Learn about the things that interest you. Discover your own culture and that of others. Stop learning if you think it's getting boring. Knowing what you like and engaging others in your interests will make you feel more confident.
Remember that it is OK to be who you are. It is in your power to become whatever you wish or to stay just the way you are. It's your choice!

And, remember, don't go to sleep without removing your make up. It's not great for your skin. Care for your skin by moisturizing and using sunscreen.
Give yourself a fantastic scent; make it your trademark. Don't feel that a perfume you like is not for you just because the person promoting it has different-colored skin than you.

The color of your skin won't usually determine your beauty regimen. Instead, base your rituals on the type of skin you have, which can be oily, dry, sensitive, acne-scarred, wrinkly, or rosacea. Regardless of your skin type, most beauty routines should include gentle cleansing, sunscreen, moisturizing, and makeup products (optional) that align with your skin needs.

Establish priorities.,
Define your goals.,
Make a plan.,
Plan for multiple outcomes.",How to Be an Efficient Teenager1," The first step in becoming more efficient is to figure out how you can best spend your time. To do that, you need to set some clear goals. Establishing your priorities is the best way to do that, as it requires you to think about what is most important to you.Ask yourself several questions in order to determine your priorities. They can be big questions, such as ""What are the most important parts of my life?"" or ""What is the most important thing I want to accomplish?""
Consider your emotions when you are thinking about your priorities. Ask yourself, ""What makes me happy?"" and ""Who do I respect?"";
, Once you have thought about your priorities, you are ready to set some specific goals. Make sure they relate to your priorities. For example, if your priority is ""Have a fulfilling career"", a good goal would be ""Getting into a good college.""Set big goals, such as college, and smaller goals, such as getting good grades this semester. This will help you keep the big picture in mind while focusing on more immediate tasks.
Set long term goals and short term goals. You could say, ""I will have a great relationship with my family"" for a long term goal. Your short term goal could be, ""I will spend time with my family this weekend.""

, An important part of goal setting is to figure out how you will accomplish your goals. In order to be efficient, you need to be organized, and a well thought out plan is a big step in that direction. When you make your plan, set goals and steps that are both specific and realistic.If your goal is to get into a good college, break that down into manageable steps. For example, one of your steps could be to write a good application essay.
Make a plan for how to accomplish this. Schedule time to brainstorm and pick a topic. Then do some research. Then write a draft. Ask for feedback. Polish your essay. These steps are clear, realistic, and will help you make progress towards your larger goal.

, When you're setting goals, be realistic. That includes remembering that you are human, and might make mistakes. It also means realizing that things won't always go your way. When you set your goals, include alternative thoughts and plans.If your goal was to make the varsity basketball team but you ended up on the junior varsity squad, that's ok. Adjust your goals so that you make the most of this alternate experience.
Slip-ups can be motivating. If you didn't make the team this time, use that as motivation to include some extra practice time when you set your goals for next year.

Find reasons you like being tall.,
Take advantage of your height.,
Learn about the long-term benefits of being tall.",How to Accept Being a Tall Girl1," Every time you find yourself wishing you weren’t so tall, think of three things you like about your height instead. As you replace your negative thoughts with positive ones, you’ll start feeling better about being tall.For example, maybe being tall gives you an advantage when you play sports, or maybe you’d like to explore modeling as a career in the future.;
, If you like basketball or volleyball, your height will give you an edge. Rock climbing, high jumping, and dance are a few other sports that tall people often excel at. If sports aren’t your thing, find everyday reasons to appreciate your height, such as reaching things on high shelves.

, Your height comes with some major lifelong benefits. On average, tall people make more money than their shorter counterparts. They tend to be happier, and they may even be more intelligent. Tall women also tend to command more respect than shorter women."

Be aware of your facial muscles.,
Watch your upper body.,
Adopt a boxer stance.,
Maintain some degree of eye contact.",How to Appear Confident when in a Fight1," Your face can reveal a lot about your feelings, and it's easy to look nervous during a tense situation. Pay attention to the muscles on your face and, if you feel them tensing up, make an effort to relax them. You want to avoid looking scared in a fight, as this can egg your aggressor on.

Pay attention to your forehead. During a grimace, you may raise your eyebrows. If you notice your eyebrows creeping up, make a conscious effort to lower them.
Focus on your facial muscles. If you feel your face twitching at all, this can come off as nervous. Work on relaxing your face, keeping the muscles still.;
, How you hold your body can convey confidence or fear. Avoid slouching or crouching downward, as this looks like a sign of defeat or fear. Stand tall throughout a fight to show you will not be intimidated.Make sure your back is straight and watch your shoulders. They may lurch forward when you're nervous. You want them to be behind your back.
Be careful of your arms as well. During dull moments in the fight, you may cross your arms or move them against your chest. This is a defensive move people do when nervous. You should keep your arms in front of your face to protect vulnerable body parts.

, This will not only make you appear confident, it will help you keep your balance when fighting. Falling during a fight can cause serious injury, so keep yourself in the boxer stance throughout the fight.Bend your knees, keeping one leg forward slightly.
Spread your feet out until your feet are roughly the same width as your shoulders.

, Eye contact can convey confidence. However, you want to be watching your opponent's movements as well. Make eye contact throughout the fight when you have a dull moment to show your opponent you are not afraid.As you are maintaining eye contact, however, be sure to strive to protect your eyes. Keep your arms in front of your face.

Call a runaway hotline.",How to Run Away Intelligently," Ideally, you'll have at least $5,000 with you. That may sound like a lot, but $5,000 can seem to disappear in no time at all. The last you want to be the first thing you're going to realize the morning after your escape is that you can't afford breakfast. If you get in a tight spot (which you likely will), you'll be glad you have the money.


This is, of course, if you don't have a job and a place to stay lined up. If you're one of the lucky few who have a pre-approved destination in mind, you may be able to get by being a little more strapped for cash.;
, Before you actually run away, you should practice living like you've done so – especially if you want to run away intelligently. This, by and large, means two things:Find ways to scavenge for food. Whether it's seeing what a few days off the dollar menu feels like or dumpster diving, practice. It's more than a good idea to see what you're in for, food and drink wise. Aside from those two ideas, we'll talk about what else you can do in the next section.
Practice sleeping in uncomfortable places. When you're on the run, you'll be sleeping on benches, behind bushes, curled in corners – you name it. You won't be sleeping in your 1000-thread count Egyptian cotton sheets anymore that your body is used to. Sleeping in hard, uncomfortable places is only difficult if you're not used to. Get used to it beforehand and it's one less thing you have to worry about.

, Sometimes runaways just go. That's the beauty of it. However, just going can be particularly stressful. It's better to go if you have a safe destination you know you can, at least, hunker down in for a while until you get your own two feet on the ground. If you had to go somewhere else right now, where would it be?


Youth shelters are a good place to start. They're not a good place to stay forever, but they can give you that time to get your situation figured out.
A friend or extended family member can be good, too, but do know that puts them in a tough place when it comes to your parents. They are legally bound to say they know where you are if your parents have filed a report on your disappearance. However, you may be able to get away with a few days, no questions asked (and food on the table).

, A good, waterproof backpack should be what you're working with (you never know if you'll get caught in the snow or rain). Inside should be a warm sleeping bag, a flashlight (spare batteries), a water bottle with a filter, storable food, a compass, layered clothing, a knife to defend yourself with, and your light valuable possessions. If you have room, it can also be nice to have a pillow with you. Everything else will just have to go.


Remember that you're taking this wherever you go, like a backpacker. It'll be annoying as much as it'll be useful. Also, remember that what you carry around determines your look. Do you look like a backpacker, tourist, or shifty runaway?

, Though it may seem counterintuitive, be sure to hide a note informing the authorities of your intent to run away so they do not believe it to be a kidnapping (or worse case, murder). The authorities are going to investigate a kidnapping more thoroughly than a runaway case.


Do not be afraid to hide this note fairly well; the authorities will find it during their search no matter how well it is hidden and discovery by your guardian would likely lead to immediate notification of authorities.

, If it's the dead of winter and nights reach below zero, you're as bright as Napoleon was attacking Russia in January. To give yourself a better shot, wait until the weather gets nicer. You'll be spending a large amount of time outside – day and night – so it's best to have mother nature on your side.


Sleeping inside sometimes lets us forget just how cold it gets at nights. Bring long underwear and warm clothing with you, even if you're not sure you'll need it. It's better to be safe than sorry, and warmth is a necessity.

, Once you're out of the house (whether it's after school or while the parents are asleep), get to the nearest bus or train station. Take a look at the schedule, and get one whichever one comes next. Hop on, and you're out of there. Now here's a few things to keep in mind:


If you decide to travel across country borders, try to do so within the first 12 hours of departure. Your passport photo will be easily recognizable by border control after your parent has had you declared an official missing person.
You are less likely to be recognized if you are not nearby your home. Although this may sound slightly crazy, it's actually easier to run away to a foreign country, especially in Europe, because you will likely be mistaken for just another American tourist with a lot of luggage.
Don't talk about your story to other passengers. They may not take pity on you (and instead take pity on your parents) and alert the police to your situation. If anyone asks, either come up with a story or tell them you'd just like to keep to yourself.

, Do not bring your cell phone, iPod, iPad or any other portable electronic devices with you. They can and will track you down using these devices. If you need a communication device to carry out your plans, bring enough money to buy a simple cell phone and some credit. It won't be fancy, but it'll be a number.


Don't update your social media either. Saying, ""I'm so tired of this crap. I'm going to run away!"" is not a brilliant idea. What's more, never go on your old Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Youtube, Gmail or any other web based account again once you leave. They can easily track you using these sites.

, If you know people are searching for you and you don't want to be found, you'll need to change what you look like to raise fewer eyebrows. The easiest thing to do will be to cut and dye your hair. Wherever you do this (though it will likely be a public bathroom), be sure to clean up after yourself. In the worst case scenario, police take your hair and get your DNA from it, getting closer to your whereabouts.


It's also a good idea to gain weight, if possible (within reason, of course). Losing weight is to be expected – those looking for you will assume you're becoming thinner as the days go by because you're not eating.

, The fact of the matter is that you're going to get lonely. You're going to be tempted to call people from your past, but if you want them to stay part of your past, you can't. Only if you are absolutely, positively confident they will not inform the authorities should you even think about it.


And even then, exercise caution. They may tell someone who will tell someone who will tell the authorities. The gossip chain is usually pretty hard to pin down, and it's always flowing from ear to ear somewhere.

, If you don't have a bed to sleep in (which will be the case most nights), the best spots to sleep are in the bushes, at the park, or in the woods or large, empty fields. In short, being out of the city is best. However, if you're stuck there, go somewhere that's open 24 hours a day, like a train or bus station.If you are in a place surrounded by people, know that you have a higher chance of police or concerned pedestrians questioning you about your predicament. Always be prepared with a back-story.
Make sure that wherever you are that's empty at night is still empty in the morning. That church parking lot on Saturday evening may seem safe and secure, but come Sunday morning you'll be regretting that assumption.

, Food is expensive. Apart from eating cheaply at grocery stores by just buying loaves of bread, cheese, and peanut butter, you should also work eating for free into your repertoire. Here are some ideas:


Dumpsters behind grocery stores and restaurants often throw out the food they can't sell. It's not necessarily old, they just can't sell it. Go at night after closing and you may be rewarded.
Poke around at buffets. When a party gets up, you go in for the pounce. Uneaten food for the win.
Ask. If you go to a restaurant, cafe, or hospital, they may take pity on you and give you some of the food they know they probably won't or can't sell. Just remember to put on your kindest smile when you do so.

, If you're sixteen or older, you may be able to get a job and settle down in your new location. It's the best way to keep your cash flowing – and besides, you didn't want to go back home anyway, right? If you can give them a phone number, an address, and look showered, you may be in.


If you're not sixteen or you admitting your identity is a problem, see if you can find day-to-day, cash-in-hand work. This will likely be manual labor but, at least, it's something. Answering flyers posted to community boards and checking sites like Craigslist are your best bets.

, Essentially, you have four options: living with a friend, living on the streets, living in a youth shelter, or squatting. They all have their advantages and disadvantages (namely, squatting is illegal). That being said, in time you'll need to find a place – if you can land a job and then find a cheap room to rent (rented by roommates, not a landlord), that's ideal. You don't want to live forever as a runaway.


Whatever you do, do not steal any items from wherever you are staying. This makes you a wanted criminal, and you are now being hunted much more so than if you had just run away.

, Maybe you've decided that wherever you are, you can't stay. That's okay. If you're out of cash, one of your options is to hitchhike It's illegal in many places, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Here are the details:Position yourself near a gas station near the entrance to a freeway or highway. You will then be able to approach the drivers that you think may give you a ride (young and old people are best; avoid those in suits and those that look crazy). If that's not an option, get near the on-ramp or a low-speed road – the drivers need time to see you and slow down.
When someone does stop, act approachable, happy, and comfortable with your situation. And then survey them: do you want to ride with them? Trust your gut; if it says no, politely decline. If it says yes, get in, put your bag in the back, and keep your hands on your knees (to show that you're not a threat).

, Don't want to hitchhike, eh? Then your next free-transport method of travel is jumping trains. It's not relaxing, but it can get you from point A to point B. Here's how to get started:Go to your local train station and get a copy of the schedule. Find the train you want to take to your preferred destination. When it arrives, get on a middle car when an agent steps away from the door. Sit down as if you came from a prior stop, and keep an eye out for the agent. When you see him or her coming for your ticket, hop into the bathroom. If he or she actually knocks on the bathroom, be on the toilet and none too happy about being intruded upon. Your only other option is wandering about the entire time, never really sitting down.

, The world isn't a very friendly place, especially when your peers are the ones that live on the street, too. If you act afraid and make yourself a target, you may find yourself the victim of a petty crime and without all your cash and belongings. Keep these points in mind:Act confident wherever you go. Being nervous invites those looking for prey to come up to you and take advantage of you. Carry a knife with you for self-defense (it's not pretty advice, but it's real).
Use a secret compartment in your backpack, if possible. If they raid your stuff, they may skip over the lining of your bag – you can keep a small laptop or something flat in there to mirror the structure of the bag.
There's such a thing as ""adventure underwear,"" and it has pockets. Thieves will generally not check your underwear, so keeping a wad of cash in there is a pretty safe bet.

, If you live in the states, it is illegal to run away from home under the age of 18 in Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.If you get caught or return home, you may be facing a penalty. In other countries, it varies by jurisdiction. And even if it is not illegal, you generally do not have rights if found and will be escorted home, even if it is against your will. It's important to go in with this knowledge so you know what you're in for.


If you have run away several times, you may become a child of the state and be forced into the foster system, or otherwise away from your home when found. You are then deemed a ""Child in Need of Supervision"" and the courts will determine what to do with you. Because of situations like this, it's best to avoid the authorities at all costs.
If you are in a foreign country that speaks a different language and you get confronted by the police, pretend not to speak English. It really helps to be bilingual in this situation, even if it is a language different than the native one of the country you're in to try to fool the police into thinking you are from a country other than your actual homeland.

, If worst comes to worst, you can always call a runaway hotline in your country. They can either set you up temporarily at a shelter or even pay for your ticket home (bus or train, usually). They also offer counsel and can be an understanding ear should you need one.


In the US, that number is 1-800-RUNAWAY.In the UK, Childline offers similar services at 0800 1111. Covenant House, based in Los Angeles but operating in many countries in North America and Central America, offers shelter to youth, and their main number is (323) 461-3131."

Make a schedule.,
Find an effective time of day.,
Say no.,
Learn to concentrate.,
Consider the long-term.",How to Be an Efficient Teenager2," Creating a schedule helps you take control of how you spend your time, which will help to make you more efficient. Try making a daily agenda that details how you will spend each hour of your day. Don't forget to include key things like sleeping and eating.Sticking to a schedule will help you make sure that you devote time to achieving your goals. For example, if your goal is to get a role in the school play, you can schedule time to study the lines for your audition.
Choose a scheduling tool that is right for you. You can hand-write your tasks in a day-planner, or you can use technology to help you. There are many apps you can put on your smartphone to remind you to do certain things throughout the day.

, Everyone works differently, so find a schedule that works for you. Try doing each of your tasks at a different time each day. Take note of when you seem to be at your most productive.Maybe you will find that you are more of a morning person. If you feel at your sharpest early in the day, try getting up early and getting your most important tasks done first.
If you are more of a night owl, try saving your most important studying for later in the evening.
Don't be afraid to try different routines to see which works best for you.

, Being a teenager comes with a lot of different responsibilities. You have to schedule school, family, friends, and other activities. Sometimes you might feel like there is simply too much on your plate. When that happens, don't be afraid to say ""no"" to joining a new club or taking on additional responsibilities.When sticking to a schedule, you need to keep your priorities in mind. Make sure that you save time for what is really important to you.
For example, if a friend asks you to run for student council, but your priority is drama club, don't be afraid to say no. Try saying, ""Thanks for thinking of me, but I've got a lot going on right now, and I need to stick to my schedule.""

, Once you've made your schedule, you want to learn to make the most of your time. To be truly efficient, you need to learn to focus on the task at hand. Take steps to improve your concentration.Try doing brain teasers. Games such as Sudoku and crossword puzzles can exercise your brain and lead to increased concentration.
The mind-body connection is also important for concentration. If you can stay relaxed and not tense, you will be better able to focus your mind. Try doing deep breathing exercises or mediation to help clear your mind.

, The point of good time management is to help you more efficiently achieve your goals. That includes both your short term and long term goals. Make sure to schedule time to evaluate your progress and to make any necessary changes.Try choosing a time each week to check in with yourself. For example, schedule a 15 minute block of time marked ""Evaluation"". Use that time to reflect on your progress.
If you feel like you are not advancing towards your goals, consider making adjustments to your schedule.

Get more rest.,
Reduce stress.,
Have fun.",How to Be an Efficient Teenager3," One of the keys to being efficient is making sure that you take good care of yourself. You can't work hard if you are not physically and mentally healthy. Aim to have a good balance in your life between work, play, and rest. Make sure you are getting enough sleep.Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep per night. As a teen, you should aim to get 1-2 hours more, since you are still developing.
There is a clear link between being well-rested and increased levels of concentration. So go ahead and schedule yourself for a good night's sleep--it's all part of increasing your efficiency.

, It's hard to perform your best if you are stressed. Teens are under a lot of pressure to successfully multi-task, so it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Try some different methods of stress reduction to find one that works for you.Exercise more. Physical activity can help clear your mind and improve your mood. Bonus: it's also good for your body!
Be kind to yourself. Even though you might feel pressure to be efficient and accomplish your goals, don't forget to cut yourself some slack. Avoid negative thoughts. Remember to compliment yourself when you achieve a goal.

, Life is not all about hard work. It's important, but it's also essential to balance work with fun. Make sure to schedule time to enjoy your friends and family.Doing things you enjoy should be one of your priorities. Try making it a goal to enhance your friendships. Put ""Spend time with Karen"" on your schedule for the week.
Try new things. You never know what you'll enjoy until you try it. Don't be afraid to join a new sports team or ask your parents to take you to see a new art exhibit. Being well-rounded can help you become a more productive person.

That number jumps to roughly 33 percent for homeless youths. This level of desperation leads to a higher likelihood of physical and sexual abuse, especially for females. , Potentially living on the streets will put you in contact with many people who abuse alcohol and drugs. If you have a pre-existing addiction then running away can make you even more vulnerable to substance-related health issues. Teens who run away have higher instances of depression and addiction so it’s important to consider whether running away will exacerbate your likelihood to consume dangerous substances. , Roughly 25 percent of teen runaways have suffered serious health issues such as gastrointestinal problems and various infections. Sign up for basic healthcare if at all possible before you leave. Easy to treat problems such as pneumonia or the common cold can turn life threatening without proper medical care. For those in the US, go to https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/4-ways-to-apply-for-coverage-in-the-health-insurance-marketplace/ for information on how to sign up for healthcare.

, Sexually-transmitted diseases run rampant throughout runaways and homeless populations in addition to unwanted pregnancies. Be sure to pack condoms and other forms of protection to protect your sexual health. Those living in the US should locate the nearest Planned Parenthood, which should provide condoms for free or at reduced prices. Check out their website at https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center.

, When running away there will inevitably be many days when you won’t have immediate access to food or you may lack enough money to purchase some. Make sure you pack a decent amount of hearty, calorie-rich food to keep you energized on the run.


Consider purchasing a small, canister stove that you can use to cook meals on the go. Having a portable stove allows you to bring light, hearty foods such as rice and oatmeal that can keep you satiated for long periods of time. Try and pack healthy, natural foods such as dried fruit and vegetables, energy bars, nuts such as cashews and almonds, trail mix, jerky, bread, and nut butters. Perishable items such as cold cuts and cheeses are nutritious as well but need to be eaten quickly to avoid getting stale.
Save space in your pack by consolidating foods as much as possible to bigger containers. Use large, resealable plastic bags instead of bulky hard plastic containers. , Do not even consider running away unless you have a sturdy water bottle with a filter. You will need to fill up water often so having a bottle will allow you to fill up for free whenever you run across a water fountain, sink, or any other source of tap water. Consider bringing water purification tablets as well in case you need to purify water from a running creek. , Bring a sturdy, waterproof backpack that will carry all of your food, clothes, and tools. Pack like you’re going backpacking through the wilderness, which requires a series of practical and potentially life-saving equipment.


Bring a warm sleeping bag, preferably a mummy sleeping bag that will keep you toasty during cold evenings. Keep a small but firm pillow with you as well.A large flashlight is crucial for navigating in the night, whether you’re on city streets or in the woods. Be sure to pack extra batteries.
A compass is necessary to orient yourself in unfamiliar surroundings. You won’t have the luxury of a smartphone so learn to use the compass before leaving.
A swiss army knife is an essential tool. Not only will the knife prove endlessly useful for defending yourself, but the assorted attachments will be important for opening cans or other daily necessities

, Be smart when packing your clothing as you need to pack light but also be prepared to face the elements. There are multiple layers you need to bring in order to ensure comfort under all weather conditions.


Outerwear is necessary to have layers that repel rain and snow. Pack jackets or coats that are completely waterproof, equipped with features such as zipper guards, sealed seams, and cinchable hoods.
The outerwear will keep you dry but staying warm is equally as crucial. Look up the temperatures for the area you will be traveling in and pack accordingly. For colder temperatures bring fleeces, wool, or light down jackets.
Underwear might seem like an afterthought but having high-quality protection is vitally important. Stay away from cotton underwear as it absorbs moisture, which can become problematic when you sweat or during heavy rainstorms. Find synthetic fabrics that are water resistant or waterproof. , Never run away with a stranger or someone who you wouldn’t entrust with your life. Ideally, you should know your friend for at least a few years and you should know how well they act under stress. Remember, both of you will be put in situations that will require mental and physical endurance so a good partner to run away with should be someone fit of mind and body.

, For example, if your name is 'Taylor' you could change it to 'Mary'. Be sure to make it easy to remember. Having a new name is key if you’re trying to lay low and stay hidden from those who are trying to find you.

, Dress in a way you usually wouldn't to avoid being recognized. Consider wearing makeup and/or a hat. Also consider giving yourself a new hairstyle or an unusual piercing.

, Be sure to know what your endgame is before running away. Do you have a friend or family member’s house you can stay at? It’s best if you have some sort of shelter in mind so you won’t have to sleep outside for an undefined amount of time. Try checking out a youth shelter for you and your friend as a last resort.

, Stay away from roads and familiar houses. Your chances of being caught are especially likely with a friend as you have two families on the lookout. Remember what your family's cars looks like as well. Keep away from your neighborhoods or obvious places where your parents might look.

, Both you and your friend should be saving up for months before the escape. You will need to have a few thousand dollars between the both of you - the more the better. Keep your money in a safe place, such as a money belt or a wallet tucked away in a hidden compartment in your backpack. Always keep your money close and know where it is located at all times.

, Whether it’s by car, train, bus, or airplane, prepare for the transportation you plan on using to reach your destination. There are important things to remember for each method of transport, so give special consideration to each before making your decision.


Your first thought may be to drive one of your cars. However, if you’re sure there will be people trying to find you then you should leave your cars at home. Your license plates will be easy ways for people to locate your car, so consider trading your car with a friend’s if possible.
The bus is one of the easiest and most inconspicuous methods of transportation. Take a look at the bus schedules and plan your route ahead of time. If you’re going across borders try to travel within the first day before the police notify authorities to look out for your passport photos.
Trains are a quicker but more expensive route. In the USA, most mid-size to large cities have an Amtrak station that can easily criss-cross the country.
Flights should be reserved at least three months in advance and must be booked without the knowledge of those who you are trying to run away from. Be sure you are committed to running away before booking a flight as you often cannot cancel your flight without spending a significant amount of money.

, Depending on your location you may be able to find drivers who are willing to drive you to a desired location. However, it's important to understand how welcoming the hitchhiking conditions are in your area. For example, in the Southeastern United States police often pick up hitchhikers and may put them in jail. Try reading over websites such as http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page to see what hitchhiking conditions are like in your region.

, Cell phones are easily traced and should be abandoned before running away. Consider purchasing a “burner” cell phone before leaving. Most major electronic stores will have cheap temporary phones you can buy with enough minutes to allow you to make any necessary calls. Avoid posting to social media as this is an easy for people to track your location and figure out your intentions of running away.

, You and your friend may get the temptation to wander away from each other when running away but any separation should be limited. When both of you lack cell phones or other forms of communication it can be easy for the two of you to get lost from each other, which could lead to disastrous consequences.

, Buffets are your friend. All-you-can-eat buffets and restaurants will be easy ways to keep you and your friend satiated for little money. Try stuffing some food in your bag as well when no one else is looking. Pay special attention to your diet on the road. Fast food may be your go-to option but eating it constantly could contribute to depression, diabetes, and heart disease, all of which can hinder your ability to stay healthy on the road. Check out bakeries and places where they serve fresh bread. Go to these places right before they close as they often have old bread and pastries that get thrown away at the end of the day. Even chain bakeries like Panera will be likely to give you their dated bakery goods if you ask nicely.
Go to farmer's markets and ask farmers for their wilted produce. Farmers typically have a batch of wilted or misshaped produce that they would throw away otherwise.

Consider dumpster diving. Lots of restaurants have decent food they throw away at the end of the day, making it worth your while to explore their dumpsters. Be sure to avoid moldy or contaminated food.

, If you live in the USA, it is illegal to run away from home under the age of 18 in Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Police will escort you back to your home regardless of your situation. Other countries may have different policies that are more relaxed. If you run away multiple times in the United State you may get put into a foster care system against your will. , Many of you and your friend’s woes could easily be solved by having a steady source of income. Thankfully there are a multitude of options for skilled and unskilled work that can be easily obtained on the road.


WWOOF, or the Worldwide Organization of Organic Farmers, represents a network of farms that give you a place to stay in return for manual labor, sometimes even a stipend. WWOOFing can be a great way to discover temporary shelters while learning marketable skills. Try looking for online work if either of you have laptops. You can easily get part-time sources of income through online transcription work, content writing, or search engine evaluation. Check craigslist often to see what work is available. There are almost always entry level positions such as dishwasher jobs that are available with little requirements. If either of you have good interviewing skills then you could land a job above your skill level to make a little more money. , Aggressive and destructive behavior can be an everyday occurrence on the street. The combination of desperation, drug abuse, and untreated mental illnesses can be a recipe for violence. Know how to recognize the warning signs of violent behavior and how to avoid dangerous situations.


Violence often sprouts from verbal arguments that become heated. If someone is being verbally aggressive, or you see an argument bordering on violent, walk away from the situation. An argument is never worth getting hurt over. Stay away from situations where alcohol or drugs are involved. Drunkenness and addictive substances such as crack-cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines exacerbate violent behavior and make people prone to desperate actions they wouldn't consider otherwise. Avoid areas where alcohol and drug use is prevalent. Above all, never fight. If you do find yourself in a violent situation, the best course of action is to run away. Pay attention to your surroundings and know what routes you can use to escape. Stay to the edge of groups of people so you don't get surrounded by multiple violent attackers. Make sure you have a safe haven in mind so you're not potentially running away to another unsafe area. , If you and your friend run out of money, become ill, or can’t put up with the lifestyle of a runaway, you need to have back-up plan. Always have the contact number for your original home in case you need to return. Remember that youth shelters are always an option if both of you need a place to stay and a warm meal at the last minute. "

Quiet the noise inside your head.Life can be very demanding and your own thoughts can pull you in a hundred different directions at one time.,
Encourage others to be honest with you.,

Accept your failings.People hate being wrong, but nobody is perfect.,
Project inwardly.,
Look in from the outside.,
Keep a journal.Write about your new discoveries and doubts throughout the entire process of renewing your self-image.,
Think about yourself in healthy ways.,
Ask yourself who you want to be.",How to See Yourself As You Really Are," Make it as detailed as possible, defining yourself as a whole person: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.


Start with statements like, ""I am..."" or ""What I'm really proud of myself for is...""
Answer each statement with at least 8 to 12 responses.
List your strengths and weaknesses, as well. Most people can identify at least one good thing and one bad thing about themselves, no matter how inflated their ego might be or how beaten up their self-esteem as become. Write out what you believe to be your strong points and your failings, as determined only by your gut response.;
, Think about the stories you frequently share from your past. Ask yourself what these stories say about you and why you feel compelled to tell them to the people you meet.


Pay special attention to what these stories say about you as a person. Do the stories convey your honesty or your bravery? Are you keen on telling them because these traits exemplify your standard behavior, or do you tell these stories because they are rare examples of traits you wish you possessed more of?

, Most people are truest to their desires and personality when they are kids. Figure out what made you happy as a child, as well as what left you feeling disappointed. Consider the sort of belief system you went by as a kid. If some of these elements have changed, note them, and note the reasons you claim behind the change.


For example, as a kid, you may have treasured the times you spent doing things independently and on your own. If you still value your personal space, this craving for freedom is an obvious part of who you really are.
If you are presently tied down to a number of obligations, though, ask yourself why. You may have learned to value family and friends in a new way, in which case, the desire to meet any related obligations could be part of the real you. On the other hand, you might be tying yourself down just to fit in with outside expectations, in which case, the real you is still the independent person you were as a child.

, In doing so, you interrupt any false perceptions of your physical self that are continually maintained every day when you check how you look.


By the end of your mirror ban, you may also reach the realization that the only one so concerned and critical of your appearance is yourself. Once you force yourself to stop fixating on your supposed physical flaws, you will likely notice that no one else is stepping up to fixate on them in your place. As a result, you may eventually realize that the negative beliefs you held about your appearance are not true, after all.

, Simplify your life for a few weeks to help minimize the anxious thoughts and negative self-talk that usually accompany a hectic schedule.


If you have difficulty quieting the noise in your head right away, plan on taking a vacation of sorts away from your inner nag ahead of time. Take care of as many of your needs as possible so that you will have little, if anything, to do during that week or so of ""vacation."" Schedule your obligations so that there will be no outside anxieties invading your thoughts during that time.

, You need to look at yourself from a new vantage point. Someone who knows you well is more likely to have a good understanding of who you really are, but the tricky thing is that few people close to you are willing to be completely honest about all your failings. You need to find friends who will be honest with you and encourage those friends you already have to speak honestly without fear of backlash.


You can make people comfortable with the idea of criticizing you by learning to criticize yourself. If you can demonstrate constructive self-criticism, the people around you may feel more comfortable telling you the truth as they see it.
Some people are naturally more comfortable with being honest. Others learn to be honest once they become comfortable with someone. You should have one or both of these types of people in your life.
When people do criticize you constructively, listen carefully and accept what they have to say. Do not react in anger and do not pressure other friends into supporting or denying their claims.

, Human beings hate feeling insignificant, so usually, a person who feels badly about himself or herself will react by finding someone else who can be looked down upon. This distorts your self-perception, though. A better thing to do would be to find people to look up to.


Looking up to other people also gives you a goal to strive for. No one is perfect, but oftentimes, you tend to admire people who possess positive qualities you tend not to possess. Admiring these people can make you more aware of qualities you do not possess, and once you become aware of these qualities, you can later try emulating them in your own life.

, After you have given yourself a vacation from your original set of perceptions, drag out the list and go through it point by point. Ask yourself if each point has any validity to it and spend the time carefully going through the list one by one.


With each perception or statement you made, ask yourself:

""Is it really true?""
""Can I prove it to be completely true? Can I prove it to be false?""
""How do I react, physically and emotionally, to this thought or idea?""
“Are there positive attributes associated with this negative quality?” / “Are there negative attributes associated with this positive quality?”



, Check your perceptions by forcing yourself to become a beginner again at something new.During times of uncertainty, one's strengths and weaknesses are more likely to show through. Pay close attention to your own reactions during the experience to get a better idea of what your own positive and negative attributes really are.


The trick is to find something you know nothing about and to force yourself into learning about it. If you know nothing about cooking, for example, then learn how to cook.
You need to pay special attention to your responses and reactions during this time. This process also needs to be completed on your own. Do not rely on others to get you through it.

, Instead of trying to deny your failings and faults, stop making excuses for yourself and be honest about the things that are wrong. This include the things you already believed to be wrong and those you may have previously denied.


Understand that accepting your failings is a necessary part of seeing yourself as you really are. Aside from that, only in acknowledging and accepting your failings can you hope to eventually improve upon them.
You need to do away with excuses, as well. For instance, if you procrastinate habitually, do not try to justify it by saying that you get the work done anyway and so it doesn't really matter. Instead, simply admit to yourself that you procrastinate.

, When faced with trouble, look internally for a cause. It can be tremendously easy to push the blame on someone else, but to avoid boosting your ego unfairly, you need to seriously ask yourself if you had any fault in the current situation, as well.


Similarly, you should project inwardly whenever you feel tempted to complain about other people. When this happens, stop and ask yourself if there might be other people making the same complaints about you.

, Think about your goals, ideas, and desires. You might be able to justify and rationalize each one in your own head, but ask yourself how you would view these attributes if viewing them in someone else instead of yourself. If the expected reaction varies, determine why this is the case.


For example, if you crave a relationship with a certain person and feel justified in your desire, think about what an outside, uninvolved individual might see. If an objective view would consider you to be naive or reckless, you should try to accept that trait of yours for what it is.

, You can write about your feelings, frustrations, or anything else related to this topic. The important thing is simply to write consistently and honestly.


Every time you sit down to write in your journal, you should keep writing until you reach some sort of understanding or state of heightened emotion.
Make sure that you take the time to write in your journal when you can focus on the task without distraction.

, While you need to be honest about your own failings, you also need to accept yourself for who you are and learn to be honest about your positives, as well. Having an overly poor self-image can be just as harmful as having an overly inflated self-image, if not more so.


You need to emphasize to yourself that you are valuable, even with all your faults and failings
When you sense your perceptions swinging in an unfairly negative direction, challenge the unwarranted guilt. If something goes wrong and you tell yourself, ""I can't do anything right,"" quickly correct yourself by listing off examples of things you have done right.

, Consider who you have come to see yourself as and ask yourself who it is that you eventually want to be. Maybe the person you want to be is similar to the person you once thought you actually were. Figure out what you need to do in order to transform yourself and make this wish a reality.

Think practical and short-term.,
Think safety first.,
Communicate.,
Think long-term.,
If you need help, ask for it.",How to Survive when You Run Away," If you have run away from home or your life. You will have limited resources available in the form of money, food and shelter. It is important you are safe and healthy.


You need to find somewhere that you can sleep safely. Look in the phone directory for homeless shelters or charities that support the homeless to assist you in finding a location and can assist in sourcing food.
Until you have further money your diet is going to be basic, so if you have some money and you cannot source free food from homeless kitchen or charity vans, try the supermarket home brand food as it is often the cheapest.
Keep in mind your facilities; if you don't have access to a stove or microwave, frozen meals aren't going to help you.;
, When you run away you are on your own in the world, and the world has the potential to be a dangerous and dark place. You need to have plans and strategies to keep yourself safe. What do you plan to do with your life, now that you are away? It isn't realistic to just hide forever, you need to join the world somehow. Even as a homeless person they establish themselves with a corner to busk or beg for money and have a repeated place or places they go to sleep.

, While you may have left your home because of a bad situation, think about how your family must be feeling. Is what you left for really that bad to inflict this much pain on them? Is a fight about a video game or a car worth them thinking you are dead? Think about the grief they must be enduring. If the situation was that bad, think about your extended family or friends. Is there anyone in your world you can communicate with? Communicating doesn't mean going back; it just means ending the grief and sadness your departure has caused. Not knowing if you are alive or dead is the worst feeling for people who love you. Think about whether you really want to cause that.

, Do you see yourself in the future just staying lost, or do you want to re-enter the world? If you do, how are you going to get accommodation? Do you need to eventually go back to school to get a job? How are you going to do that? Do you need to wait until you are old enough so that the law can't force you back home? If that is the case, how are you going to get an income? How are you going to hold a job without indicating where you are? Most jobs require lodging of tax information which in turn require your identity; how are you going to get around this?

, There are a lot of free resources for children or adults that need help. Free telephone counselling is available to help you resolve the issues. Talk to charity workers about your life and why you left it and maybe they can help find a way back if you want it. If not, they can still help with any feelings of sadness, anger or depression you may be carrying around.

Smile and let your personality shine through.,
Don’t be afraid to wear heels.",How to Accept Being a Tall Girl2," You’ll do wonders for your health and self-image if you use good posture. Keep your head up and your shoulders back. Don’t slouch – besides causing back problems, this can actually draw attention to your height, because it makes you look like you’re trying to shrink. Own your height and stand up proudly., No matter how cute something is, only buy it if it fits you. Nice, well-fitting clothes will make you feel more confident about your appearance. On the other hand, clothes that don’t fit can detract from your self-confidence by making you look gangly or awkward.Make sure your pants are long enough. Too-short pants will only make you look taller.
Be aware that even average-length skirts and dresses tend to look shorter on girls with long legs. Maxi dresses tend to be flattering on tall girls.
If you’re creative, you can learn to sew your own clothes. You’ll have fun designing things that fit you beautifully, and you won’t have to worry about being unable to find clothes at the store anymore.

, When you’re happy and confident, people will pay more attention to your sparkling personality than your height. Be positive, friendly, and kind to others. Focus on how much you have to offer the world besides your height.People will probably always make comments or ask questions about your height. Many times, they are paying you a compliment, so don’t be embarrassed. Smile and thank them if they’ve said something nice, and answer any questions they have.

, There’s a stereotype that tall girls can’t or shouldn’t wear heels, but that’s just not true. If you like heels, wear them! Your confidence will shine when you dress the way you want to. Heels will also make your legs appear even longer, which is a flattering look for anybody."

If boys make fun of you, it might be because they feel intimidated around a girl who’s taller than them. Their insecurity is the problem, not your height.
If you’re being bullied in school, let your parents and your teachers know what’s going on. No one should have to put up with bullying, especially over something they can’t control like height.

, Remember that, as a tall girl, you need to weigh more than your shorter friends – it doesn’t mean you’re fat. Instead of comparing your weight to other people’s, use a BMI chart to find your healthy weight range.A good rule of thumb is to add five pounds of weight for every inch of height. For instance, if your 5’4” friend is 120 pounds and you are 6 inches taller, you might want to weigh about 150 pounds.
This guideline will vary based on your frame size and lifestyle. For instance, if you’re an athlete, you might weigh more due to muscle mass.

, Size doesn’t determine how compatible you are with another person. If you want to date someone shorter than you, that’s your business and no one else’s. Enjoy the relationship, and don’t let rude comments get to you.If someone teases you about dating a shorter person, stand up for yourself. Say “Why does it matter?” or “We really like each other, and I’d appreciate it if you stopped making jokes.”

If you are concerned that your friend ran away from an abusive situation at home, or the parents seem uninterested in locating their child, call the police yourself (or have your parents do it). Runaway teenagers can quickly find themselves in dangerous situations, so it is important you act on your suspicions.
Give the police a detailed description of the person. Indicate height, weight, hair and eye color, if they have glasses or braces, any distinguishing marks, and the last clothes they were seen wearing, as well as other identifying information.
For example, you could say, “Jane is sixteen years old. She’s about 5’7” and 130 lbs. She has short brown hair, brown eyes, and a mole next to her right eye. She wears glasses for reading. She likes to dye her hair, so it may also be a bright color. She was last seen wearing a red tank top, black shorts, and black flip flops. She often wears a gold necklace with a cross.”
Ask the police to make a report to the FBI's National Crime Information Center database, known as NCIC. In order for a missing person poster to be created and disseminated to law enforcement, you need your child’s information entered into this database.Ask which officer will be assigned to your child’s case when you are making your initial police report. Record the officer’s information and the best way to contact them.;
, After you have filed your initial police report, begin making calls to other organizations that can help you in the search for the runaway. Besides these organizations, your local police may have additional resources for you to contact:


Call your Sheriff’s Department and state police to report the runaway.
Call the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Call NCMEC at 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) after you talk to your local police. They will help coordinate leads to your local police.The National Runaway Safeline can provide assistance and support in this situation. Call 800-RUNAWAY (800-786-2929).

For example, you could say, “I have already spoken to Officer Jones in my local police department, who took the police report and is assigned to the case. Is there anything else you recommend I do, or anyone else I should talk to?”

, Keep a notebook handy and record all conversations and phone calls, with dates, times, and topics discussed. This will help jog your memory and keep you organized.Things will be moving very quickly, and you will likely not be able to remember details of conversations, or if you talked to a certain person. Get in the habit of writing everything down right away.

, Make a list of everyone in the person’s life and contact them, starting with their closest connections. Keep track of the names and contact information of those with whom you have spoken. You may want to give a copy of this information to the police as well.


You could ask, “Manuel, I haven’t seen Caleb since Tuesday. I know you guys are close. Have you seen him? Did he tell you where he was going? Have you been in touch with him?”
Keep in mind that close friends may try to protect the runaway. They may lie or withhold information.Talk to everyone you can think of, including the person’s teachers, coworkers, teammates, or even employees at places where the person liked to hang out. They may have seen or overheard something that may be helpful to you.
There may be a lot of people to talk to in a short period of time, so enlist trustworthy members of your support network to help you contact people. Consider asking your good friends or reliable family members for help.

, Search the teenager’s room, phone, or computer for clues as to where they might have gone, or people they are with. The police might want to conduct an investigation on your teenager’s property themselves, so make sure to clarify with law enforcement if this is okay for you to do.Access their social media accounts and email for hints as to where they have gone.
Check their phone log and text messages. Follow up with anyone your teenager has communicated with recently.
Search their room. Look through diaries and notebooks for any useful information.
Check in with your child’s school. Talk to your child’s teachers and administrators and let them know the situation. Ask to be contacted if they hear of any leads. Ask to access your child’s locker and look through it for any useful information., While most runaways return home, it is still important to work on bringing the person home safely as quickly as possible. Teenagers frequently run away without a plan,and when food, money, or shelter runs out, could possibly engage in survival sex (trading sex in exchange for necessities) in order to provide for themselves.Do not view the runaway situation as something for the runaway to deal with: “She’ll come back when she’s ready, but in the meantime, she needs to deal with the consequences of her behavior.” Teenagers can quickly find themselves in unsafe situations they incapable of handling, like drug abuse or prostitution.Runaway youth are also at an increased risk for homelessness, physical abuse, and mental health issues., Think about why the person might have run away. Ask yourself some questions about their recent behavior and issues they were facing. Consider if anything they were doing or if anyone they were talking to could help you determine where they may have gone.


Think about any recent problems at home. Was there a fight, a change in family structure, or abusive behavior?
Think about their social interactions. Did they start hanging out with new people? Did they keep their social life a secret? Were they talking to someone online frequently?
Think about their past behavior. Has the teenager run away before? What happened the last time they left? What was their motive for leaving then?, Create a Facebook page called “Find .” Social media can be extremely influential in helping spread the news and raise awareness. Share your page with everyone you know, as well as on local community pages.Assume the person is able to see what you are posting. Post pictures of them with friends and family, happy memories, or videos of them having fun with loved ones. These show the runaway how much you love and miss them. These posts also personalize the runaway for strangers who might be following their story and help generate more interest in the case.
Consider going on Twitter and tweeting the story to news media and other influential individuals.
Create an email address associated with finding the runaway. Send an email from this address to all your friends and family requesting help, with a link to your Facebook page.

, Connect with people who might be useful in getting the information out there. Consider people who interact with the public on a daily basis, and ask them to reach out to their contacts, and/or display flyers for you.


For example, you may have a pilot, a minister, or a social worker in your contact list. The pilot could hang the flyer in the crew lounges of airports. The minister could bring flyers to the hospital when visiting patients. The social worker could utilize their contacts at local government agencies to help spread the word of the runaway.

, Distribute several recent pictures of the runaway, and create a flyer with their information and last known whereabouts. Use high-quality photos that show the person’s face from different angles so that others get a better sense of what they look like.Put the flyer in high-traffic locations, like gas stations, train stations, interstate rest stops, or bus depots.Distribute flyers to local hospitals and mental health treatment centers.
Ask local stores and businesses to hang a flyer in their window or other location visible to customers.

, Contact local papers, TV stations, and radio stations with information about the missing person and ask them to help you broadcast the information. Ask them to share the information on their websites as well..


You could say, “My son has been missing since Monday. We suspect he ran away. Could you please post his picture in your broadcast tonight, as well as put it up on your website?”
Provide copies of high-quality photographs of the runaway to media representatives, as well as a missing person flyer if you have made one. Provide both digital and hard copies if necessary.
Consider designating a family member or friend as your go-to media person. Let this person coordinate photos, schedule interviews if necessary, and research contacts at local publications. Working with the media can be very time-consuming and draining.

This step is useful for teenagers who are upset or angry at their parents but are not sure if their parent's actions justify leaving home. Consider the following questions:Am I in danger if I stay at home? This question is important, as it will help you determine if you need to take action to get out of the home. If you feel the abuse at home is out of control and dangerous to your safety, there may not be anything you can do to change the environment and it may be time to get out.
How will I survive? This question is useful especially for teens who are not sure where they will live or how they will survive once they run away from home. Creating an escape plan and taking steps to adjust once you leave the home will help you answer this question.

You can also contact the National Runaway Safeline (1-800-RUNAWAY) or the National Runaway Switchboard (800-621-4000), a 24 hotline that can connect you to professional services for runaways in your area., One of the key details on your escape plan is having a safe place to go to once you leave the abusive home. This could be a trusted relative’s home, a close family member’s home, or a runaway shelter. You can also stay at a hotel for a night or two if you are of age.You should arrange your stay with a relative or family member beforehand. You can also stay with a close friend. It is not against the law for someone to take you in if they believe you are in danger. But if the adults in the safe place do anything illegal or lie to the authorities about your whereabouts, they can be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Call the shelter near you and let them know when you plan to leave so they are aware of when you are going to be there.

, Though it may be challenging to find a safe place to go, leaving without a safe place can lead to a night or several nights spent sleeping on the streets. Often, the streets can be very dangerous and risky, especially if you are a teenager. Avoid this option by arranging for a safe place before you leave the abusive home., You are going to need cash on hand to pay for your stay at a hotel and other basic amenities you may need as you transition out of the abusive home. Try to save as much cash as you can and store it in a safe place where it cannot be found.If you are a teenager who is planning to run away from home, you can likely find a runaway shelter where you can stay there for free for a few nights. You may also be able to stay with a friend or a relative for free until you figure out where you are going to live permanently.
If you are an adult trying to get out of an abusive home, you may have a joint bank account with your abusive spouse. Apply for a new bank account at a bank that is close to the safe place you will be heading to when you leave the home. You may need a new permanent address, such as the safe place address, to apply for a new bank account. Doing this will cut you off from your abusive spouse and make it harder for him to find you.

, Bring a few changes of clothing, toiletries, identification documents, and any small sentimental items. Try to fit these items in a small bag so you can carry it easily with you when you leave.Make sure you also bring cash with you as you will need this to pay for items once you leave. Avoid using credit cards as these can be used to locate you.

, Once you have an escape plan in place, it’s important that you get rid of any traces of your escape plan that may be on your computer or your phone. This will prevent the abuser in your home from finding out about your plans and ensure your escape plan will be successful., Per your escape plan, take your packed bag and go to your agreed upon safe place. Time this for when the abuser is out of the house or when you are alone in the house. Avoid giving your abuser any indication of where you have gone, as this could place you in danger.


You may use public transportation, such as a bus or a train, to get out of the abusive home and go to the safe place. Or, you may be able to arrange a pick up a few blocks away from the abusive home through the person who lives in the safe place, if they have a car.
If you believe you are in danger and cannot get out of the home, despite your escape plan, call 911 or a domestic abuse helpline.

, If you are a minor (under 18 years of age) and you decide to run away from an abusive home, you should be aware of your legal status as a runaway. Though state laws can vary, in general, your parents have a legal right to call the police and report you missing. The police may then try to locate you and bring you home. If you are older than 18 years of age and are running away from an abusive spouse, the police do not have the jurisdiction to return you to the home.As a minor, you can prevent the police from taking you back to the abusive home if you explain your situation. Describe in detail the abuse you have suffered and let the police know that you are afraid to return to the home. The police will then take you to Child Protective Services.
The CPS worker will then listen to the details of your situation and determine if your parents are providing a safe and stable environment for you as a minor. If she determines this is not the case, she can authorize your removal from the abusive home.

, If the CPS worker determines that it is not safe for you to return to the abusive home, she will suggest that you stay with a relative or with someone you feel safe being around. If you do not have a safe place to stay, she will refer you to a runaway shelter.A professional counselor will talk to you at the runaway shelter and allow you to stay there if you are at least 12 years of age, you are mature enough to stay in the shelter, and it is clear you are in danger if you return home.
Though the shelter staff may tell your parents where you are, your parents cannot simply take you from the shelter. Some shelters require parental permission to house runaways and some do not. Talk to the shelter about their rules.
You can find out more information on runaway shelters through the National Runaway Safeline, 1-800-RUNAWAY. The safeline is open 24 hours a day and can refer you to professional support people in your area., Once you are in a safe place, it is important that you take steps to remain hidden from your abuser. This is especially applicable if you are running away from an abusive spouse. Change your address and get a new bank account.You can also change your social security number so your abuser cannot use it to try to locate you. Call the social security office near you and explain you are a victim of domestic abuse. They will often let you change your social security number due to abuse circumstances.
You may also want to consider hiring a lawyer, especially if you are going to have to fight for custody of your children or your assets.

Manage stress.",How to Avoid Getting Discouraged," You cannot avoid disappointments and setbacks. They are a part of life. However, you can learn to control your attitude. The first step to positive thinking is taking responsibility for how you feel.Discouragement is easy to feel. There is much in life over which you have little control. While circumstances are frequently beyond your control, you can control your response.
Take full responsibility to your attitude. Each time you feel inclined to respond to a setback, remember that feeling discouraged is up to you. You can choose to avoid this feeling.;
, It's important to identify triggers for discouragement. Think about times in your life where you frequently feel discouraged. You can target one area at a time as you work on changing your thought patterns.It's normal to feel confident about some things, while insecure about others. You may be more prone to feeling discouraged about certain aspects of your life.
For example, you may feel discouraged about your job, your friendships, your romantic relationship, and so on. Think about the moments where you tend to feel discouraged. Moving forward, you can focus on being more aware of your thoughts when you encounter discouragement.

, You need to be aware of your thinking. If you're prone to feeling discouraged, you may have knee-jerk responses throughout the day. Work on watching out for negative thoughts. When you find yourself thinking negatively, take a step back and try to reassess the situation.You may find your thoughts are mainly negative. For example, you get an e-mail from your boss asking you to redo a report. You may think something like, ""I can't believe I screwed that up. I'm such a bad employee."" You may start to feel discouraged at this point.
This is a thought pattern you could try to change. How can you put a healthier, more upbeat spin on this? Maybe instead you could think something like, ""I'm glad I got this feedback. This is an opportunity to grow and change.""

, Throughout your day, try to say nice things to yourself. Avoid saying anything to yourself you would not say to another person. If you engage in a lot of negative thoughts about yourself, you will be more prone to feeling discouraged.Evaluate any negatives thoughts that enter your mind. Ask yourself whether they're rational or fair.
If you find yourself thinking negatively, try saying positive things about yourself instead. List your best qualities and things you're grateful for. This will make you a happier person, and you will be less prone to feeling disappointed.

, Feeling like you are in control of your environment and that you can change the outcome of your situation may help you to stay positive.Try to develop your sense of control to avoid becoming discouraged when something does not go your way.


Try making a list of everything that you can control. You might include in this list things like where you work, where you live, the people you spend your time around, and the way you spend your spare time.

, Disappointment is normal and happens to everyone at times. If you can't see beyond the present moment, you may be inclined to become discouraged. However, you don't have to get stuck in disappointment. Instead, pause and look at the big picture.Think about how this event will play into the larger narrative of your life. While it may look bad now, there is so much more to come. Maybe, in the long run, this setback will have been a good thing.
Reflect on what you can learn. Take a step back and look at how you go about things. Maybe this setback is indicative of negative patterns you tend to engage in. Instead of feeling stung by it, see as an opportunity for personal growth.

, Just after a setback, do something small that feels productive. Even a small bit of action can make you feel like you're bouncing back from negativity. This will replace feelings of discouragement with feelings of forward motion.Think about what you could stand to knock off your to-do list. Maybe you've been meaning to do renovations on your personal website. Maybe you need to email back a client. Do something productive.
Forward motion can help. Even a small task can help you feel like you're bouncing back from a setback and moving forward.

, If you want to resist discouragement, consider how you define failure. If your definitions of success and failure are too rigid, you may be prone to feeling discouraged after a setback. Stop thinking of a perceived failure as inherently negative. This can help you feel invigorated, rather than discouraged, when things don't go your way.Everyone fails at some point in life. Everyone has screwed something up at work, lost a job, missed out on a promotion, and faced other failures. It is normal, and even inevitable, to fail.
Take failure as a chance to reevaluate. Do not see it as inherently negative. Think of it as a necessary stepping stone to progress. Ask yourself what you could have done better, and think about how to work to assure success in the future.
If you think of failures as opportunities to reevaluate and recharge, you will be less prone to feeling discouraged.

, Discouragement can often come up due to a heavy focus on outcomes. While it's great to work with a goal in mind, try to shift your primary focus on the process. If you're always working on something meaningful to you, you're less likely to feel discouraged. You'll always be occupied with a worthwhile task, even if things don't always go your way.Think about the work you engage in each day. Is it meaningful to you? Does it make you happy? Think about how and why you feel fulfilled. Focus on what you need to do, day in day out, and try to give your work your all.
If you learn to value your work, any outcomes will give you a sense of accomplishment. Even outcomes and successes that are not your ideal will feel meaningful. This can help you experience less disappointment.

, Being able to solve problems in a methodical way will help you to be a more resilient person. If you can apply a problem solving strategy when something does not go your way, then you may find it easier to deal with the problem in an effective way. Some good strategies to sue when you are facing a problem include:Making sure that you understand the problem. For example, if you are having an issue at work, then take some time to think about the specifics of the problem. Are you feeling discouraged because your efforts are not noticed? Are you feeling discouraged because you have not had a raise in a long time? Try writing down exactly what is bothering you.
Searching for appropriate solutions. Then, try to identify some solutions that may help. For example, if you are discouraged about not having had a raise in a long time, then you might decide to talk with your boss and request a raise. You could even plan out what you might say to him or her and set up a meeting.
Carrying out a plan to achieve a solution. Follow through with the solution you have chosen. For example, if you have decided that you need to ask your boss for a raise, then make sure that you do so.
Reflecting on your work and asking how it could be better. After you have carried out your plan, reflect on how well your strategy worked. For example, did you get the raise? If not, then what might have gone wrong? What could you do differently next time?

, Resiliency can help you become resistant to discouragement. People who are resilient bounce back quickly from setbacks and hardships. To be resilient, try to embrace change.Change is a natural part of life, and not all change is bad. People who are resilient accept change and try to adapt quickly.
This can help how you see disappointment. A change in a relationship is part of the natural progression of a relationship, and not necessarily something bad. A change in your work situation may result in you liking your job anymore. You do not need to be discouraged by change, as it's not always a bad thing.

, You want to have big dreams and aspirations. Very successful people tend to overshoot a lot. If you don't feel like your goals a little intense and unreasonable, you may be aiming too low.Believe that your abilities can help you achieve your goals. Try to go into each day thinking that you're smart, capable, and ready to achieve success.
This will rub off on other people and help your achieve resiliency. If you think highly of yourself and your abilities, one failure will not bother you much. You will feel prepared to come back stronger the next day.

, Stress management can help you develop resiliency. It can also improve your overall attitude, making you less likely to feel discouraged. Take steps to reduce the overall stress in your life.Find ways to cope when you feel stressed. Look into relaxation techniques, like visualization or yoga, to reduce stress. You can find guided techniques online, or look into taking a class.
Identify causes of stress and find ways to better deal with them. For example, maybe driving to work causes a lot of stress. Maybe you could take public transportation, walk, or bike instead.
Seek support from others. If you're having a stressful day, talk things over with family members and friends.

(Remember, running away can ruin your life...only do so if you are desperate) And if you are think of how your family will react and feel if you run away.",How to Run Away and Live on the Streets As a Teen," If this is a temporary problem (anger or feelings), please consider other options. Running away is extremely dangerous and should only be used as a very last resort. If you are being physically or sexually abused, please call the authorities or a trusted adult. These people can find a good foster home for you to live and charges will be pressed against whoever is abusing you. Sit down and think about it. - Are you sure you want to run away? Weigh up the pros and cons of doing so. Never run away if you didn't get your way with your parent(s). And if you do leave, be careful not to get caught. You'll most likely be retained in jail if you're young. In most states it is considered a crime, and think about it before you stay at a friend's or boyfriend's house. They could be arrested for harboring a runaway.;
, Options include a homeless shelter, a friend's house or a cheap apartment - somewhere you feel safe. Remember, if you're on your own you will need to find a real job, but if you are very young, it is not legal to hire you; you may have to lie about your age. You would need a social security card (but you can be traced by its use through income tax and such), and you may have difficulty to be hired without your parent's permission because of your age. Young, broke, without ID, and alone is not going to work.


Going the legal route may get you into a good foster home, but maybe it will not work out that well. But, you are much more likely to be safe. You need to be realistic.

, Some people will make inquiries about your background. They will want to know where you're from, why you're there and such. You will need answers. You may wish to give yourself a fake identity. A name and a quick backstory will do in the case of socializing, but be careful not to go over the top. Make it sound convincing and true. In some cases you will need an elaborate and well planned identity, so be prepared. Stick with one identity, instead of making up several. You may wish to fake a foreign accent, but only do it if it is not too conspicuous, and you know where it comes from, so people don't ask as many questions.

, This will give you an idea of what questions you may be asked when applying for a job, and you can prepare a good answer for then, including:


Why do you want to work here? (Why does the work or opportunity appeal to you?)
What are your plans for the future? (Don't over brag. Don't be overqualified, or they may, often, assume ""you're too good for the job"".)
What do you like about this work, shop or company? (Give a sincere reason for your compliment - or it will, probably, sound false or shallow.)

, Of course, if you have been truly abused and are planning to never come back, then their assuming this can come in handy. It all depends on your situation.

,, This are: right after your parents go to sleep, early in the morning as if you went to school, or after school (but only if your parents have a job that keeps them occupied after school). Travelling alone at night can be dangerous, so going in the morning is safer.


10 - 120 seconds: Be sure! Get going as fast as you can, and get on a bike, or get to a bus or subway station. You should not drive because you will likely be too young. Also your folks will eventually discover that their car is missing, and driving can slow things down. It is also unsafe. (Look as calm and composed as possible, and avoid becoming a target. Be dressed like you are going to school or your grandmother's house, not like you are going to a party, and don't wear expensive jewellery.) Get as far away from home as possible, to reduce the temptation to go back. Most importantly, get a grip.
2 - 180 minutes: Fear of the real world is what will nab you now. Walk to a place you know well and enjoy visiting, such as a park, store or library. Sometimes people skip this step, so if you do, try to get as far away from your house as possible. Pace yourself, you've got a long journey ahead of you.
3 - 72 hours: Now you're on your own (unless you're with someone else, which is not recommended), go to somewhere your family won't think to look for you. Try to make it to another town or state. Make sure you don't have friends or relatives who live there. Do not go to relatives unless they are supportive of you leaving. Otherwise they will just call your parents to come get you.
3 - 365 days: Again, try to get to a different state or town. You will need to get a job to pay for an apartment.

A college town is a good choice, there may be several cheap rooms around, and people expect young adults (who may look very young) to be looking for a job and for places to stay, so do some searching. If you want to save time and search online, go to an internet cafe. Look like a conservative student, not like you are going to a party.



, If you're running away with a friend, make sure you're both on the same page about what you want out of this, where you're planning to go next and what your limits are.,,, Your parents or police can most likely track you on that, Example: If you buy something with a credit/debit card, most likely your parents or police will track where you used it, and who knows, you may not be too far from there, and that will most likely mess you up and get you caught.

, Exposure is deadly in cold weather. If it is very cold, you may wish to stay in a homeless shelter instead of outdoors. Shelters are safer and warmer, although you must be prepared to answer questions on arrival.

, Bring a small or ""travel"" sewing kit that is easy to carry around.

,, You can use the change to wash your clothes at a laundromat.

, If it feels gross, wear two pairs and keep it between them. This way if you happen to get mugged they take the change in your bag and think that's all. Bring a small handbag with a few coins in, so muggers can take it instead. They might steal your shoes, also - so don't keep it in obvious places such as shoes, socks, back pockets or anywhere visible. Don't keep money in your bra, in case someone peeks down your shirt and sees it there, or knows that women hide money there. Bring lots of paper money, because coins can rattle and make you more attractive to muggers. You will likely need at least $1000.

, Don't take too much food; take a few days' supply of food that you don't need to cook (canned, dried, frozen etc) It is more important to bring money. If you run out of food, go to a Costco or somewhere with lots of free handouts. Say you're waiting for a friend, and don't linger.

,, If someone says, ""I saw you with some yesterday,"" say you've spent it all, even if you haven't.

, You will regret it. Never take unbooked minicabs, use drugs or resort to prostitution.

, Wear simple, inexpensive and non-conspicuous clothes you have never worn before. Don't wear lots of jewellery -- that will make you a target. If you wear glasses, choose a different frame for them. Walk in a different way than you usually do: people can often be recognized by their movements. For example, if you usually dawdle, walk quickly, or vice versa.

, Being young, always stay near somewhere public, like a library, or a big store, in case someone tries to kidnap you. A general rule of thumb: if someone tells you they'll give you a room for the night, say no. Don't sleep in a forest or a park, you could get yourself killed or get mugged. Sleep in a dark doorway, near somewhere that stays open all night and is lit up. You don't want to get raped/mugged/killed while you're sleeping peacefully.


College campuses are generally safe places, often with buildings that open for 24 hours and will provide a shelter, but look the part with a spiral notebook and a thin college text (realize that they do have campus patrol officers who will see you and be suspicious, if you seem to be camping or sleeping outdoors. That is not allowed, so you need a good place to do it safely). Janitors will turn you in if you are sleeping/making a place in areas where they have to clean. If you ever need help, go to a friend, then run away, so she/he won't call your parents or the police.

Yet before you make a quick decision about running away, it is important to reflect on why you are running away, and if there are less drastic ways to address your situation.


Identify if there are ways to talk with your relatives, friends, or mentors at school before making a big decision to run away.
Understand that running away will not likely fix the problem you’re facing.
Think about running away as a worst case scenario, not the first way to handle your problem. Utilize any supports you have in your community first, including your school, places of worship, community centers, and friends.
Understand that running away may feel like the only option in the heat of a moment, but in reality you may face the same or worse challenges after the fact.;
, Physical or sexual abuse are particularly harmful, even if it happens once. Emotional abuse may more difficult to pinpoint if it happens once, but if it happens on a regular basis it can be just as traumatic.


Types of physical abuse include punching, biting, scratching, strangling, pushing, or kicking. It could involve objects being thrown at you. It involves an intentional and unwanted contact with you or something close to your body. Types of sexual abuse include unwanted kissing or touching, pressuring or threatening someone into unwanted sexual activity, attempted rape, rape, or non-consensual sex.
Types of emotional abuse include repeatedly humiliating you, threatening to harm you or others in your family, putting you down with derogatory names, yelling or screaming at you on a repeated basis, or repeatedly blaming you for their own actions.

, If you are currently in danger of ongoing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, running away could take you out of immediate danger. Don't allow yourself to be put at risk of physical or sexual harm.


If you are running away to escape physical or sexual abuse, call the National Runaway Safeline which is open 24/7: 1-800-RUNAWAY (1-800-786-2929) or http://www.1800runaway.org/

If you are running away from a difficult family life, you will likely find that it could be even harder on the streets. There are many cons to running away.Understand that homeless runaways are at high risk of being sexually exploited, becoming dependent on drugs or alcohol as a means to cope, and being victimized or placed in dangerous situations. You could also end up in trouble with your local law enforcement.Think about these questions: How will you pay for food? Where will you sleep? How will you get in touch with people in case of an emergency? What happens if you’re feeling more afraid or scared after leaving home?
Without a good answer to these questions, running away will often make matters worse for yourself and your loved ones. They will be worried about your safety, which is a real concern.

, If you’re feeling like running away, and you need to talk with someone immediately about what you’re going through, then call, text, chat or email the National Runaway Safeline which is open 24/7: 1-800-RUNAWAY (1-800-786-2929) or http://www.1800runaway.org/


Talk with a trained social service professional about the pros and cons of running away. If you are currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, call them for support immediately.
Use their advice as a guide about the options available to you in your community. They can create a safety plan with you.
Listen to them about resources such as local runaway shelters, and possibly free counseling services for at-risk youth.

, What would make it okay for you to stay at home? Turn to people you trust in this difficult time, and express to them what you think you would need to be safe at home. Explain about your thoughts about running away. Be honest with them about your feelings. See if they would be willing to listen to you if you needed to call them in times of struggle or fear.
Ask the people you trust if you can depend on them for support if you ended up in trouble.

, Always have a plan in place of where to go when you’re feeling overwhelmed, scared, or hurt. Think about the places that make you feel loved and safe. Identify spaces or rooms in your home where you feel safest. Is it your bedroom? A living room? A kitchen? Use those spaces when you’re feeling anxious and need time away from your family. Find ways to take a deep breath, and calm your mind in that moment.
Identify other places in your community where you feel safe, such as your school, community centers, or places of worship. Seek out professionals and mentors that work or volunteer there to express your need for guidance. They can help you better assess the pros and cons.
Identify your friends’ or family members’ homes where you can go if you need some time away from your family to feel safe.
Understand what runaway and homeless shelters offer (and don’t offer) in terms of support.

, If there are possibly incidents of abuse or neglect by a parent or guardian when you are under 18, some school or healthcare professionals may be required by law to report those incidents. In such cases, a report may be made to Child Protective Services agency for evaluation.


This does not automatically mean that you will be removed from your home or that your guardian will be disciplined. Each evaluation is case-by-case.
Talk with a school administrator or counselor that you trust about what may or may not happen when abuse is reported. If you are fearful of retaliation, talk with a school counselor or other adults who you trust about your need for safety.

, Make sure to keep a phone or phone numbers of one or two reliable friends, family, or community members. They should be the people you call when you’re feeling scared, depressed, upset, or anxious.


Call your friends when you need help to calm down about what you’re feeling. It will be best to have at least one contact that is an adult, not just other friends. Think about if there is an aunt, cousin, or grandparent that you can call when you’re feeling upset.
If you’re feeling like running away, talk with a mentor at the community center or a religious leader in private about your feelings. They may have advice on youth activities that can help cope in healthy ways.

, Find a supportive teacher or school counselor that you talk with about your home life and thoughts about running away. Discuss with them in private your concerns. Avoid utilizing only your friends for guidance on how to handle family conflict or issues of abuse.If you feel unable to talk with staff at your school about your problems, find local community centers or a counseling center that may be able to assist.
See if your school, friends, or relatives can recommend any professional counseling services in your area. Professional counselors and social workers are trained to address family conflict and other difficult issues. If you are having difficulty with talking to your parents or relatives, family therapy may help you learn to cope with your family.

, Don’t feel alone in this situation. While it may seem like there is no way out, or that life is too overwhelming, there are others who have faced similar challenges. Seek out support from adults who you trust with personal information. Find others in your community who are facing difficult family situations.Within your family, think about adults such as cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, or other relatives that have overcome difficult family challenges such as domestic violence, abuse, substance abuse, divorce, or financial stressors.
Ask community leaders or mentors for support and advice about how they overcame their stressors and what they may recommend.

, There are other teens that can provide emotional support or just a listening ear by phone or via text, chat, or email. They are trained volunteers the same age as you. They can help you to manage stress and learning healthy coping skills.

Look for other peer support groups that may be offered through your school or in your community. Consider engaging with other teens who can provide an objective perspective on your situation.
There may be other online peer support group sites available if you’re thinking about running away or can’t cope with your difficult family.

, They may lack knowledge about what obstacles you may face. While they may be easier to talk with than your family or some adults, thoughts of running away should involve talking with people who can provide possibly concrete options about how to cope.


It’s important to have someone on your side who isn’t trying to force you one way or the other.

, While asking for help may seem embarrassing, scary, or anxiety-provoking, running away may be worse. Running away is only a temporary (and possibly more dangerous) solution to your problem. While it may seem like a bigger risk to speak up, this is a much healthier way to confront your problem than to run away from it.Make sure to find a supportive person who can help you step by step through this act of speaking out. Talk with a counselor, teacher, mentor, or caring relative. You’re not alone.
Prioritize your safety over your guilt, shame, or hurt.
Remember that things can get better. Accept that while you can control other people’s actions. You make the best effort to handle your own in a responsible and mature way.

, Sometimes we need a little distance from family or friends who are making us stressed or anxious. Instead of making plans to run away, consider having a sleep-over at a friend or family member’s home where you feel safe and supported.


Avoid sneaking around or avoiding your family when you’re trying to find a place to stay with friends or relatives. Tell your family that you’re trying to be honest with them rather than sneaking out and that you hope they can respect what you’re feeling.
Avoid asking your parents or guardians to “leave” and instead ask in a calm manner, “Can I spend some time with ? I’m feeling overwhelmed right now, and I just need a little space. I will make sure to be back by .”
Coordinate this plan and transportation arrangements before you ask your parents or guardian.

, Identify the strengths in yourself, in others, and in your surroundings to help with stress, anxiety, and depression. Focus your time and energy on being with people who make you feel safe and happy. Find activities that make you feel more confident that you can overcome challenges.Hang out with or find friends that may you feel included, supported, and reassured. Avoid the negative people who bully, reject, or hurt you.
Take time for yourself. Take a hot shower to feel better. Engage in daily breathing exercises to help you calm down. Make sure to get enough rest. Consider praying or meditation.
Do activities that make you happy and relieve stress. Listen to your favorite music with headphones. Draw in an art book. Write in a journal about what you’re feeling. Play music or sing.
Get active. Get out for a walk or run. Ride your bike. Do stretches at home or outside. Consider taking an after-school fitness or martial arts class. Join a sports team at your school. Go to a local gym or activity center.

Your doctor should be able to help you find a telepsychiatrist that will meet your needs.;
, Before you use telepsychiatry, you should make sure this service is covered by your state’s medical insurance. Many states do not reimburse patients for telepsychiatry, through this is changing and will likely shift in the future. Call your medical insurance provider to check that you can get your telepsychiatry appointments covered.If telepsychiatry services are not covered by your healthcare provider, you should speak to your doctor or to a representative at the mental health clinic to ensure you know the cost of the services before you access them.

, When you use telepsychiatry, you have the option of having sessions from the comfort of your home computer or at another location, such as your doctor's office or at a mental health clinic. You should consider which option is most convenient for your schedule. Due to immobility or your remote location, sessions from your home may be easier to arrange than sessions at another space.

It always takes time to adjust to a growing body, so don’t think you’ll feel awkward or strange forever. Chances are, you will start to feel more and more beautiful the more comfortable you get both with your body and with yourself.


There are many beautiful and admired women who are tall. For example, Cindy Crawford, Michelle Obama, Behati Prinsloo, Angelina Jolie, Venus and Serena Williams, and Maria Sharapova are all tall and admired.;
, You can reach high stuff many people can't reach. People tend to have more respect for someone who's tall and may even take you more seriously. When you go to a concert or sports game, it’s likely you can see despite the large crowds. These are some of the many benefits of being tall that work in your favor!.People might think you’re older than you are. They might treat you more maturely or give you more leadership roles., At the moment, you might be towering over your classmates and friends. Going to dances or doing paired activities may be totally cringe-worthy, but know that this won’t last. It may take a year (or two or three) for other friends to be the same height as you, but it will happen. You can feel a sense of relief when others begin to be taller than you!It might feel like the end of the world, but it’s not. You won’t be the tallest person forever.

, Your height may make you feel shame and you may wish more than anything to be shorter or at least feel more “normal.” if you experience shame in your height, recognize that it only harms you and takes away from your happiness. You cannot change your height. Show compassion for yourself. Admit that it’s hard to feel different, but it doesn’t have to feel bad.If you feel ashamed of your height, move into a place of acceptance, not dissatisfaction. Give yourself permission to have feelings about your height, but don’t let them take over your life.

, Some people might make fun of you for being tall. Don’t take these comments seriously. It’s best just to let them go and not let them bother you. Brush off these insults and remember that being tall is just one part of who you are and in no way defines you. If you’re upset by someone’s comments, tell an adult like a parent, teacher, or authority.
If your friends make fun of you for being tall, tell them to stop. If they don't, they are not real friends. Find new friends.

, There are times when being tall is a distinct advantage. If you enjoy sports and athletics, it’s likely that you will excel quickly and naturally due to your height. Did you ever think that because you're taller you'll have less distance to swim in a race? What about catching a rebound in basketball because you can reach higher than your peers? Take advantage of these opportunities and feel good about contributing to your team.


If you don’t enjoy team sports, try dancing or rock climbing.

, Your tallness isn’t something that will magically change. For this reason, work toward accepting and embracing your tallness. One way to do this is by using affirmations. Create an affirmation about accepting your tallness and say it to yourself daily. It might feel silly or untrue at first but keep at it. Say an affirmation that affirms your value and worth.For example, say, “I am worthy and valuable just the way I am” or, “I accept my body and love it.”
You can also say, “I accept that I am tall.”

, Feeling good about yourself isn’t just about accepting your tallness. Focus on loving all parts of yourself. Find all the things about yourself that make you uniquely you. Surround yourself with people who are positive and who make you feel good about yourself. Reflect on your accomplishments and your positive qualities.For example, you might be compassionate, helpful, kind, a good listener, and generous.
If you can't think of any good qualities of yourself, try developing your self-esteem.

, Undoubtedly, you will weigh more than girls who are smaller than you. Don’t stress over this. If you’re self-conscious about your weight, don’t talk about it or avoid conversations where girls are talking about weight. It’s okay to weigh more than your smaller friends, but it’s also understandable if you don’t want to talk about it.


You also don’t have to be ashamed of your weight. You can talk openly about your weight and be okay with it. Just don’t compare your weight or try to lose weight because others weigh less than you.
If your friends bring up weight, change the subject or go do something else.

, You might feel tempted to wear clothes that hide your body or make you feel invisible. Focus on finding clothes that flatter instead of hiding. It might be harder to find clothes that fit, but take the extra time to find the clothing lines that cater to your height. You’ll feel more confident and better about yourself when you see how nice you look in the mirror. Find styles that flatter your tallness and make you feel good.Shop online for tall fitting sizes. Few mall stores have pants with inseams longer than 35 inches (88.9 cm).

, Don’t try to lose weight or eat less in order to stop growing.Cutting calories or skipping meals won’t make you any shorter, it will only make you feel sick and lethargic. Eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Try getting involved in making your own food or helping prepare meals at home as a way to focus more on nutrition and preparation.It’s okay to have sugars and sweets, just eat them on occasion.

, Remember that most people feel self-conscious as teens. While you’re feeling self-conscious about being tall, many boys are self-conscious about being short or scrawny. Teen girls start comparing their bodies to each other and realize that puberty looks different for each girl. If you feel insecure, it’s more than likely that your friends and classmates do, too.Especially if you’re in the middle of a growth spurt or just completed one, it’s normal to feel different and think you look strange. Your friends are probably thinking the same things about their bodies, too.

, If you’re tall, it’s likely that at least one of your parents is tall, too. Talk to them about what it was like to grow up tall and how they dealt with it. They may be able to relate to you and give you some advice. You might also talk to a tall aunt or teacher and get their perspective. Even talking to other tall friends can help you feel less alone and more supported.


Talk about the struggles of being tall and ask for advice in how to cope. For example, say, “How did you learn to be comfortable with your height?” or, “How did you cope with being taller than boys?”

, Talk about height with some of your tall and short friends. Many short women dislike being short. It can be helpful to talk about your experiences with others who struggle with height. It’s also a great way to gain perspective on what it means to be short and the problems that other people face.


Ask a short friend to talk. They may even say that they wish they were tall like you.

, If your tallness is affecting your self-esteem and you feel bad about yourself, it might be time to talk to a professional. A therapist can help you make sense of the feelings you have and help you improve your sense of self-worth. If you’re dealing with shame, depression, inadequacy, or powerlessness, a therapist can help.You might want to start at school and talk to your guidance counselor. You can also ask your parents or guardian about seeing a professional therapist through their insurance.

Plan ahead.,
Travel light.,
Choose to run to a safe location.,
Find a place to get the help you need.,
Consider making an anonymous tip.,
Think ahead about work.",How to Run Away from Home As a Teen2," Running away without proper preparation can put your life in danger. Take as much time as you need to figure out a game plan. Where you are going, transportation, work, and shelter are all important to consider. Gather supplies beforehand, some of which might include:


Cash
Change for the laundromat
First aid kit
Coat
Sleeping bag
Socks
Change of clothes (x2)
Change of underwear/bra (x2)
Toothbrush/paste
Tampons/pads
Hairbrush
Water bottle
Non-perishable food (granola bars, canned food)
Pepper spray
Deodorant, Carrying a heavy load can slow you down if you need to move quickly. As a teen runaway, many other homeless will be bigger and stronger than you, and if you need to escape, you need to do so quickly, without being bogged down by creature comforts. Only pack necessities. Take as much cash as you are able, but be wary of credit or debit cards, which can be tracked. Pack for your destination. If you are heading somewhere cold, your greatest concern should be keeping warm.


Keep in mind that arid climates, like the desert, get very cold after dark. A lightweight thermal blanket could save your life., Staying in a forest, park, or nature preserve is not recommended. All it takes is a bad step and you may be stranded with a broken ankle far from medical help. If you want to live in the country, be sure to travel along main routes where you can flag down help if needed. If you live in a city or are running to an urban area, try to find a shelter. If you don't have any safe options, try to rest in a busy place during the day. Sleep on a blanket in the park or at the beach during the day. This will make you look less suspicious and more like a normal person taking a nap.


A location with public transportation is a good choice, as it is cheaper and faster than other options.
A bicycle can be useful, but its weight and safety can be a bigger hassle than help.
Bridges offer protection from the elements and the cement will hold warmth from the day through the night. Beware of others if you attempt sleeping under a bridge; these are popular locations for other homeless.
If you chose to go to a homeless shelter, you must be prepared to answer questions when you arrive.
A friend or a relative's house should be considered, but will come with its own rules. You will always have to respect the homes of others.

, The most important thing you can do after you escape your situation is getting to a place of wellness. Whatever trauma made you leave home in the first place, it is likely there will be some resulting issues you'll need to address before you are able to start living a healthy and happy life.Before you leave, do some research on the area you are running away to, and find halfway homes, detox centers, or counseling centers so you can get yourself the help you need.


If you have turned to drugs or alcohol as a way of coping with the things you have suffered, this will eventually cause even greater harm to you physically and emotionally. You are not to blame; whatever you have suffered has pushed you into a vulnerable place. However, you cannot truly be well on your own until you address and resolve your addictions or dependencies., Even if you've made up your mind to never return home, there may be other people suffering from the same abuse or neglect that you did. Especially if you have siblings, please consider making an anonymous call or tip to the police or Child Protective Services in your state, or talking with ChildHelp from a public phone or using a friend's phone.


Child Protective Services: Within the US, state numbers for CPS can be found at the Child Welfare site here.
Child Helpline: (800) 422-4453

, As a teen, even working at a fast food establishment will require you to have parental consent along with other necessary information, like an address and your Social Security number. Eventually, you will run out of supplies and money. You will need a source of income to support yourself. When applying for a job, hint that you are looking to make some extra money working ""under-the-table"", which means you will be paid directly by your employer secretly, usually in cash. Some under-the-table work options you can consider:


Busboy (restaurant)
Dishwasher
Landscaping/gardening
Tutor
Babysitter
Mover
Painter"

Escape your situation.,
Always put food first.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Never resort to prostitution or to using alcohol/drugs.,
Determine places you can take care of your needs.,
Maintain your safety.,
Do not steal.,
Have answers to questions.,
Do not use your cellphone.",How to Run Away from Home As a Teen3," Leave when you won't be seen and be sure you won't be immediately noticed. For example, you may want to call in to school sick and leave on your way, or you might consider leaving right after everyone is in bed. This will give you a few hours to put distance between you and the place you are running from. Try to make it as far away as possible before stopping to rest. To make yourself more difficult to find, you should try to get out of town, and eventually, your state.The train or a bus can take you a great distance for a small cost. Wear a cap with a brim or a hood so that your face is covered and you do not show up on security footage.
To make yourself less noticeable, dye your hair a common color that's different from your natural shade and/or cut your hair. Be sure your new haircut/dye job doesn't look sloppy; some might question your appearance if you aren't careful.
Take clothes you rarely or never wear. You can always purchase new clothing cheap from a thrift store so you aren't wearing anything that can identify you.

, This is your top priority. You can fill up a bottle of water at nearly any sink, but beware labels that say ""Not Potable"", as this means the water isn't intended for drinking. Take all food you find and all food offered to you, and be sure to eat it before it goes bad, even if you aren't hungry.

, This is especially important when you start looking for work, but will also keep you from getting picked up by police for vagrancy (homelessness). Stay away from dangerous places where robbers or rapists could be lurking, which includes alleys or secluded areas of parks. Although cleanliness is important, try to look as sexually unappealing as you can to protect yourself from predators.


Dress like you are going to school or an informal church event, not like you are going to a party. Clothing with lots of pockets will provide you with places to keep necessary supplies.

, Don't let anyone pay you for sex. This could result in you getting hurt, robbed, or the person might even refuse to pay you after finishing with you. The person may wait until you are vulnerable before asking you to go farther than you are comfortable. Your money will be necessary to pay for things you need to survive; do not waste any of your limited cash on alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes.


Although other runaways/homeless may abuse drugs or alcohol, and may even offer you some, always refuse the offer. It will be difficult for you to defend yourself when drunk, high, or incapacitated.

, Private/public restrooms, while not the most comfortable, are good places you can groom yourself. Have an answer ready for anyone who questions you. Something like, ""I've been traveling with my mom all day to get to my grandparents house and we stopped here to freshen up,"" might prevent the police from being called on you. Ladies can use Nair to remove hair and maintain appearances. Try not to look suspicious when taking care of your bathroom routine.

, There are many tools you can use to keep safe, like a rape whistle, pepper spray, or a multi-tool, which can be used both for protection and in emergencies. Keep your tool well hidden but within reach at all times. Money should be kept in your underwear, not in socks or bras, which is where many people first look.If someone says, ""I saw you with money last night,"" say that it's all gone, even if you still have some.
Keep a spare, visible bag or purse with a few dollars and coins. This way, if you're robbed, they'll take this instead.If you run out of money for food, be careful when begging. This will draw attention, and in some cases, upset other homeless. It is also illegal to beg for money in some places.
A supermarket that offers free samples is a great place you can find food without drawing attention to yourself. If someone asks, you can always say you're waiting for your mom.

, This is not only illegal and immoral, but it will draw the attention of others, including the police. Stealing can result in even more serious consequences than simply being returned from where you have run.

, People will likely ask questions if they see you around when school is in session or brushing your teeth in a public restroom. Don't respond to these with the first thing that comes to mind. Come up with a story explaining your situation and stick to it; this will prevent inconsistencies that will make people question you. Think ahead of time about what people might say in response to your story so you are prepared with a believable response.

, This can be used to locate you after you've run away, but in an emergency, it can save your life. Keeping your cell phone turned off will prevent you from being tracked, or you can replace your SIM card."

Like said in the step about make up, being a strong teenage girl/young woman doesn't mean you have to dress a certain way to live up to someone else's idea of 'strong'.",How to Become a Stronger Teenage Girl," Develop and know your own opinions, share them with other people and don't be afraid to speak your mind (even if some people might not like it). However, make sure you can listen to others' opinions and make informed decisions. Don't argue for the sake of arguing, but stand up for what you believe in when the time calls for it.;
, Use your brains to help you get through tasks. Be the leader of the group and make your own decisions. Always listen in class and try your hardest when it comes to exams. Academics is important. This isn't necessarily straight A's - this is about trying your best and reaching goals that are realistic to you.

, CCF is a good choice if you want to work on your strength and leadership.

, Use this time to sort out things on your mind and escape reality.

, Think about archery, biking, martial arts, even taking long walks in your local woods.

, Try to be independent. When you get older you will find that you have 2 or 3 close friends if you stay independent. Having loads of friends is something you only see on kids TV. Remember - it is the quality of the friend, not the quantity.

, ""Don't do weights or take protein shakes- it will wreck your body"" is something stupid people say. Don't listen to them. As well as lifting, have a balanced diet source of protein, may that be that meat or fish or another vegan/vegetarian source such as nuts or tofu, and do exercises daily or weekly.

Your comfort and confidence in your appearance is what is most important here.

, You can also do it in a braid or if you have shorter hair, clip it back on one side. These hairstyles are practical for workouts.

, It's not worth it if it is making you unhappy. However, it is good to have some friends of different genders/backgrounds/races/sexualities because they tend to have a different take on things.

, You can't say 'do this, where that', because if you're not comfortable, there is no point. Dress in a way that conveys you and your individual strength and personality, be that in tanks and combat pants, a proper skirt and blouse or, heck, even a showgirl costume! Be yourself, and above all, do not talk badly about another strong young woman who has a different interpretation of 'strong' to you. Do not use slurs, do not brand someone a 'prude' or a 'slut' because their 'strong' is different to yours. And remember - not all young women are females and not all young females are women. Be supportive of all interpretations of strong, both yours and others.

Reflect on what happened.,
Give yourself time to wallow.,
Do something nice for anyone you hurt.,
Make peace with your past.,
Symbolically move on to your new life.",How to Be Okay1," What happened, and how did it make you feel? How did it effect you and others? What is the big problem here—the difficult part that makes it difficult to get over this particular memory?


You may find that writing about it helps.
If the event was particularly traumatic, talk to a counselor, therapist, or doctor.;
, Take a warm bath, eat ice cream, watch movies, and cry. Try designating a weekend to experience your unhappiness. Wrap yourself in blankets and indulge in self-comfort. Sometimes, you just need to let out all your emotions before you are able to move on.


If you get stuck in the wallowing stage, then something is wrong. Talk to a counselor or trusted adult right away, because there may be going on than meets the eye.

, If they are open to seeing you, give them gift, write them a nice note, or apologize in person. If you broke something, ask if you can help fix it. You can mend relationships and overcome guilt by being kind to people you wronged.


Respect their boundaries. Sometimes, the best way to help is to listen when they say ""please leave me alone.""
Ask how you can make it up to them. Focus on their needs, not your guilt.

, Your past is part of you, and it has shaped who you are. What you faced was rough, and now you are a stronger person. Acknowledging it is important to being able to stop focusing on it.


Recognize that you did the best you could at the time.

, Redecorate your room completely. Get a new haircut. Update your wardrobe. Do something nerve racking for you, but still something you can laugh at if it fails. Now you have accepted your past, so it can no longer haunt you, and you can move on as a whole person.

Practice kindness.",How to Be Okay2," Just like an orchestra is comprised of all different instruments, life is full of different people. Your uniqueness adds value to the world. Come to terms with who you are, and recognize that you don't need to change the fundamental aspects of your identity.


Your gender identity, race, sexual orientation, disability, skin color, clothes preferences, and size are all valid. You should not need to change them (or hide them) in order to get basic respect.
You are allowed to like whatever you want. Don't listen to elitists who say that something is ""too girly,"" ""too childish,"" or otherwise ""not good enough.""

, Self-improvement is a good thing, but so is recognizing that you are fundamentally human. It may not be practical or possible to please everyone all the time, constantly suppress your temper, or whittle your curvy figure down to a size 2. Accept that you can't control everything, and that it's okay to have flaws. Instead, focus on what is under your control, and let the rest go.


You are allowed to make mistakes sometime. Everyone does. Learn from them and move on.
Not every opinion, social message, or piece of advice is valid.
People tend to judge you less than you think.

, Grateful people are happy people. Every night, write down two things you are thankful for about today. Are you happy about your friend's kind words, your awesome science project, the nice weather today? Write in it every day, and you will feel yourself slowly becoming a happier person.

, Your day shouldn't consist of mainly work. Give yourself plenty of time for hobbies, loved ones, and general relaxation. Set aside a specific time each day where you can do something you enjoy.


Place a reasonable limit on time spent browsing the web, as this can overtake more important things like friends and hobbies.

, Large tasks can feel overwhelming and may cause you to panic or freeze. Instead, do one small part of the task: write a rough draft of one paragraph, spend 20 minutes on calculus, or sketch the outline of your presentation. This will help you feel better, and by breaking it into pieces, the task becomes more reasonable.


If this happens to you often, tell your doctor. You may have an anxiety disorder, a treatable condition that may affect your ability to work.

, After about an hour of intense concentration, your neurons get tired and stop working as well. You can fix this by taking 5 minutes to do something else: stand up and stretch, get a drink, talk to a friend, or do something fun. This will help prevent burnout. When you sit back to work, you'll be more focused and productive.

, Fresh air and sunlight are important to your physical and emotional health. Something as simple as a 10-minute walk after supper each day can give you a significant boost.


Try setting up a basketball hoop and shooting hoops when you're stressed or you need to think.
Bring a loved one on a walk around the block so you can catch up with each other.

, This may be your job, a volunteer opportunity, or your personal relationships. Find a way to help others. When you are making the world a better place, you feel better too.


Consider how you can use your unique skills. For example, an engineering student probably couldn't do a good job building a school for impoverished kids, but she could work to design infrastructure or teach the kids about her field.
Everyone has some sort of skill. Maybe you're good at mentoring kids, selling work and donating part of the profits, or writing work that inspires others to do good things.

, Work on being patient, and reaching out to others who are having bad days. Perform random acts of kindness. Approaching others in a gentle and understanding manner is instrumental in feeling good and building relationships.

Let your emotions out.,
Spend the next two minutes on calming down.,
Make a plan for how you're going to get through the next hour.,
Do something for yourself.,
Reach out to someone.",How to Be Okay3," Find an opportunity to be alone, where you can cry and let your feelings loose. Let yourself punch the couch cushions and scream into pillows. Call a friend to vent if you need to.

, Focus on your surroundings, take deep breaths, and try counting in your head. (Try counting by sixes, sevens, etc. if regular counting is too simple.)

, Don't worry about anything beyond that. What are you going to do? Choose something reasonable. When you have planned a designated time to work, and a designated time to relax, you can feel less anxious. Here are some example plans.


Spend the next half hour on drawing pictures and relaxing. Then do a half hour of the lab report.
Draft one body paragraph of the essay. Then take a long, relaxing bath.
Write a draft of what you want to say to your boss. Then stop thinking about the conversation and play with your cats.

, Indulge in a favorite hobby, invite a loved one to see a movie with you, or go get some frozen yogurt. Recognize that relaxation is part of being prepared and successful.

, Emotional support can help you overcome your struggles, or at least make things a little easier. Don't be afraid to ask for help or companionship. You deserve it.

, For example, start music lessons individually if you want- e.g. school music room- piano..., read books believe me they are interesting. Take time to do things you want- like drawing, listening to music, making crafts- origami, put music on and start doing belly dancing or hip hop if you prefer?

, Getting at least 8 hours a sleep for someone is vital. Sleep helps restore your body inside and out so don't skimp on it!

, Be sure to keep fit and healthy. Exercise or/and at least walk for 30 minutes a day. Also, if you stretch at night before you go to sleep, you will feel great (and never tense) when you wake up in the morning.

, You must already know it's terrible for you: it makes you smell and look awful and it destroys your organs from the inside out. If you don't smoke, never start because it's very hard to quit. You can get medical help if you want to quit or try by yourself, smoking less and less. Stay away from other drugs too (non-prescribed medication, alcohol, excessive caffeine and others). Even if someone tells you that they're not bad for you, they sure can't do any good

, Keep some water with you at all times and drink to keep healthy. Water is good to every part of you and most people don't drink enough

, Use shower gel or soap of any smell to wash yourself (eg. strawberry soap, chocolate soap, orange soap.) Be sure to wash everywhere with your hands or a washcloth or a shower sponge.

, Choose a shampoo and conditioner combo that you like and that suits your hair type (get advice from others if you are unsure).

Asthma.
Type 2 diabetes.

Sleep apnea.
Fatty degeneration of the liver.;
, Children who are obese can suffer social discrimination. The stress caused by this can lead to low self-esteem. This in turn can slow down intellectual and social performance. These debilities may carry over into adulthood.

, The following steps will help you bring about the changes your child needs to defeat obesity.


Develop Healthy Eating Habits
Limit the eating of sugar and saturated fats, and especially trans fat.
Make available a generous supply of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products.
Advocate drinking more water and less sugar-sweetened drinks.
Serve appropriately-sized portions. Remember how small your child's stomach really is.
When possible, use low-fat or non-fat milk or dairy products as appropriate. In some cases low fat milk is not appropriate.
Select lean meats, poultry, fish, and beans for protein.
Make healthy changes to old recipes.
Replace high-sugar high-fat foods with healthy alternatives.
Remove unhealthy temptations.


Increase your child's physical activity. It is recommended that children and teens get an hour of moderate intensity physical activity daily. A few examples include:
A brisk walk
Jump rope
Swimming
Playing soccer
Dancing
A game of tag


Limit the time your child spends watching TV, playing video games, or surfing the Web. A two hour limit of sedentary time is a good goal. If your child can’t control his or her time on the Internet on his own, consider buying a software-based computer timer such as Ez Internet Timer. With this program, parents can easily enforce time limits.

, Reward your child with things other than 'treat' foods so they grow up feeling chocolate, cake, cookies, chips, fizzy drinks etc are not something they deserve or a form of consolation. Avoid them forming a habit of comforting eating, if possible. It's easy for parents to feel they are depriving their children if they deny them what their peers are enjoying. You're being a good parent if your child has a healthy, balanced diet, however much the child may whinge and whine, that, ""Everyone else is allowed candy for breakfast""."

Pursue new experiences.,
Surround yourself with positive friends and role models.",How to Take Good Care of Your Body (for Tween Girls)," Menstruation usually occurs in girls between ages nine and 13.When you first start to menstruate or get your period, your flow may be irregular as your body adapts to the rapid physiological changes. You may notice a clear or white fluid secreting from the glands within your vagina several months before you get your first period. Don’t worry, this is a normal occurrence and is an indication you are going to get your period soon.Your menstrual cycle has three phases. The follicular phase is the beginning of your period and ends when you start to ovulate. This phase usually lasts 11 – 21 days. The luteal phase is the start of ovulation and continues until the beginning of your next period. The menses phase is the final phase of menstruation where you bleed during your period and typically lasts around three to seven days.In addition to bleeding, you may also experience cramping before or during your periods. Other side effects of menstruation include bloating, mood swings, and headaches. If your cramps become severe or your other period symptoms become severe, you should see a doctor to get medication to alleviate the side effects. You can also ease menstrual pain using home remedies.
Once you get your period, you can still do activities like swimming, horseback riding, yoga, and physical education classes. You can participate in normal activities and should try to be physically active during your period, as it can help to ease your cramps.;
, Feminine hygiene products such as tampons and pads are an important way to collect the bleeding that occurs during your period. You should decide if you are more comfortable using tampons or pads. You may start with pads and then as you get more comfortable, you may switch to tampons. You can find feminine hygiene products at your local drug store.To use pads, place the pad in your underwear with the sticky side down and press it in place. It will then soak up the bleeding. Make sure your replace your pad as needed so the bleeding down not soak into your underwear or give off a strong smell.
To use tampons, you will need to put it inside your vagina to soak up the blood. There are instructions on the label of the tampons that show you how to insert them properly. Some tampons comes with a plastic or cardboard covering, known as the “applicator”, that will make it easier for you to insert the tampon. Do not leave the applicator in your vagina once the tampon is in place.
All tampons come with a string at one end to help you take it out when it’s time to change it, which should be done every four to eight hours. Tampons are designed to stay in your vagina and will not get lost or slip out. Only use a tampon with the lowest absorbency level based on the heaviness or lightness of your period. Never use a “super” tampon if a “regular” tampon is needed. Using tampons that are too absorbent or neglecting to change your tampon when needed can put you at risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare but dangerous infection.
You may also wish to use a menstrual cup, which is a reusable cup you insert into your vagina for up to 12 hours. You empty and wash the cup before reinserting it.

, As you continue to develop, you may notice your skin will become more oily and you may sweat more. This is because your sweat glands are growing and your hormones are starting to kick in. Acne is common in teens, especially with the hormonal changes that occur with puberty and can appear as bumps such as blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, or cysts. If your parents had acne as teens, you may be more likely to develop it as well. You can help to prevent acne and treat your acne by following a skincare routine.Make sure you wash your face at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, with a mild cleanser and warm water. Use your fingertips to gently massage in the cleanser and avoid scrubbing, scratching or picking your skin. Avoid astringents as they can dry out and irritate your skin. Use a light, water-based moisturizer that has SPF 15 or higher to protect your skin from the sun and to prevent it from getting dry.
If you want to wear make up, look for water-based products that are labeled “noncomedogenic” or “non-allergenic.” Use makeup remover to take off your makeup before you go to bed, as going to bed with makeup on can cause acne.
If you start to develop more severe acne, you should see a dermatologist to get prescription treatments for your acne. The earlier you address your acne, the faster it will go away and you will have a reduced risk of scarring on your face or body due to acne.

, You may also notice that because you are sweating more, you may have a stronger odor coming from the sweat glands in your armpits. Manage this odor by using deodorant or antiperspirant. You can buy these products at your local drugstore.Apply the deodorant on your arm pits in the morning as part of your morning routine. If you tend to sweat a lot or are going to do physical activity, you may want to re apply the deodorant throughout the day.

, For many tween girls, puberty appears through breast growth and development. You may notice small, tender lumps on your chest and your nipples may get bigger over the next few years. As your breasts develop, one breast may appear larger than the other but they will even out by the time they reach their final size and shape. To help support your growing breasts, you should talk to your parents about getting a bra.Getting a bra can be exciting, as it is your first step to becoming a woman and an adult. But if you are shy or embarrassed about having to buy a bra, you may want to go on a shopping trip with a friend who already has a bra instead of your parents.

, The same hormones that cause acne can also cause oil build up on your hair and scalp. Wash your hair everyday or every other day to help control and prevent oil build up. Apply the shampoo with warm water and massage the product into your hair and scalp. Do not scrub, scratch, or rub your hair or scalp too hard.You can also use conditioner after you shampoo your hair to keep your hair healthy and less oily. Look for hair products that are formulated for oily hair. If you notice white flakes on your clothing, you may be developing dandruff. You can use antidandruff products to help control dandruff.
You should also use styling products like styling gels and lotions that are oil-free or less greasy so you do not make your hair more oily and dirty-looking.

, You may start to notice hair growing on your legs, arms, and armpits, as well as pubic hair on your vagina. Some tween girls will start to shave their leg hair and armpit hair as a personal preference. This is a purely aesthetic choice and does not provide any medical benefits.If you decide to start shaving your leg hair, you should use a razor made for body hair and shaving gel or warm soap and water. Ask a parent to show you how to properly shave your legs, as you are using a sharp razor and do not want to hurt yourself. Always shave up your legs, against the direction of your hair.
If you decide to also shave your armpit hair, make sure you use shaving gel or warm soap and water to create a lather. The hair in your armpit may grow in different directions, so you may need to shave in a few different directions as well.

, In your tween years, you may notice that your arms, legs, hands, and feet are growing faster than the rest of your body. You may feel more clumsy or awkward, but over time, you will get past these growth spurts and you will feel more comfortable in your body. You may also notice that your body shape and weight is shifting. You may develop more fat in your stomach, buttocks, and legs. This is completely normal and part of growing up. No one’s tween development will be the same and you may notice your body is developing differently than other girls your age.

, During your tween years, it’s very important that you maintain a healthy lifestyle by being physically active at least one hour a day. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight, prevent serious illnesses, give you more energy, and give you more confidence. If you already enjoy a particular activity or sport, consider joining a team or a league. Sign up for your school team or look for a recreational team in your area. Talk to your parents about pursuing a sport more seriously, especially if you enjoy it and are good at it.
If you are not very physically active, you can start slow by making fitness goals. This could be joining a yoga class or a fitness class with a friend and doing it for a set number of weeks. Or this could be taking up a gym routine and going one day a week for several months. Focus on realistic goals and enlist the support and help of friends and family to stay motivated.

, Getting eight to 10 hours of sleep a night can allow you to do all the things you enjoy and maintain your commitments, like school, family, friends, physical activity, and hobbies or passions.Set a sleep schedule by waking up at the same time every morning and going to bed at the same time every night. You should avoid hitting the snooze button or use an alarm without one, as snoozing in the morning can throw off your internal clock.
Do a relaxing routine before bed like taking a bath, reading a book, or talking to a friend or parent. Avoid bringing screens into your bedroom or into your bed, such as your cellphone, your computer, or your TV.
Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable. Dim the lights, curl up in your favorite comforter or blanket and listen to soothing music to help you go to sleep.

, Healthy eating is essential to having enough energy to get through the day and to maintain a healthy weight. Try to avoid eating junk food and fast food every day or even every week, as it is an empty source of energy and it will not keep you full and healthy.

Start every morning with a breakfast high in fiber, such as a bowl of whole grain cereal. You can also add a few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your cereal or add flaxseed to your breakfast cereal, your yogurt, or your morning smoothie.
If you struggle to eat healthy while you’re at school, try to go for the fruit or vegetable option in the cafeteria and load up on healthy grains like rice, quinoa, or couscous. You should limit your portions so you have one cup of fruits and vegetables, one cup of grains and a small serving of protein like meat, beans, or tofu on your lunch plate.
You can also make your own lunches to bring to school with a healthy serving of fruits and vegetables, protein, and grains. You should also pack snacks in your bag like nuts, dried fruit, or fresh fruit, so you can avoid getting hungry throughout the day. Snacks are also useful if you are doing sports or other activities after school and need some extra energy.
You should work with your parents to develop healthy dinner meals at home and make a meal schedule. This way, you will know what’s on the menu for the week and can assist your parents in cooking and preparing the meals.

, While it may be tempting to skip a meal or not eat a meal in an effort to lose weight, depriving yourself of food will only throw off your food schedule and confuse your body. Instead, focus on eating three healthy meals a day and balancing your meals with exercise. This will help you to maintain a healthy weight and have enough energy as your body continues to develop into adulthood.In your tween years, you may be more susceptible to emotional eating, where you eat because you are bored, stressed, or feeling down. Avoid the need to do some emotional eating by writing in a journal, going for a walk or a run, hanging out with a friend, or volunteering in your community. Building good eating habits will help you to maintain a positive body image and feel healthy in your developing body.

, As you enter your tween years and eventually your teen years, you may struggle to maintain your self-confidence and your self-esteem. This could be due to your developing and changing body as well as the emotional effects of puberty. Building good self-esteem will give you the courage to try new things and the power to make good choices. When you start to feel sad, alone, anxious, or stressed, you may want to focus back on your needs and practice self care. This can help you to remember your inner strength and make yourself feel confident again by focusing on yourself.You can practice self care by taking the time to pamper yourself with a bath, a facial or a pedicure and a manicure. You can also focus on alone time or “you time”, where you do an activity that will calm you, such as reading, writing, listening to music, or taking a 10 minute power nap.

, Another way you can build your self-confidence is to push yourself to pursue a skill or activity you are good at and enjoy. This could be a sport, a hobby, or a field of study that you are passionate about or interested in. Or this could be an activity that you seem to have a natural aptitude for and excel at with ease. Doing well in a skill or activity can help you to feel empowered and boost your self-esteem.Make a list of the skills or activities that you enjoy doing, such as basketball, swimming, painting, singing, or writing. Try to set goals around these skills or activities and motivate yourself to pursue them. You may decide to enroll in a painting class after school, for example, or you may try out for the basketball team at school. These actions can help you to improve your skills and feel a sense of achievement while doing an activity you enjoy.

, Embrace a positive attitude by being willing to try new experiences. Try a new hobby and discover a hidden talent or join a club and make new friends. Expanding your horizons will allow you to also discover different parts of yourself and have new experiences. This can help to motivate you when you are feeling anxious, bored, or lonely and boost your confidence. , The company you keep can also contribute to your self-confidence and self-esteem. If you have friends who are constantly putting you down or putting themselves down, they may be bringing negativity into your life and eroding your self-confidence. Look for friends that make you feel unique, interesting, and valuable. Having positive people in your life will only enhance your self-esteem and give you the confidence to be yourself.You should also look for positive role models in the form of teachers, family members, peers, or even your sports coach. Receiving guidance, support, and mentorship from a role model can help to boost your self-confidence and grow as an individual.

Your BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It will tell you whether you are severely underweight, underweight, average/normal, overweight, and obese. Make sure that you use a BMI calculator that factors in age and height! Calculate your weight now, and if you are in the normal range, you shouldn't lose more than a few pounds. If you're underweight, you need to gain weight!;
, Have a reasonable weight in mind, and use that to motivate you to keep your commitment. Say you are 145 pounds, a good goal weight just to start would be say 140. Ease yourself into it. Once you reach that weight, you can go to 135, then 130, and so on until your goal.

, There are lots of great websites that will track your calorie intake and output that really help you lose weight! There are also iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad apps that can help you.

, This is the main factor in losing weight! Make sure you don't overdo it though, or else you could risk injuries. Try going for a run when nobody is home, or if there are people home, take your dog for a walk and turn it into a run!

, You need to make sure you get protein, carbohydrates, dairy, fruits, vegetables, fiber, and some fats. Make sure that you get all of these within a day.

, On this day, you can eat however much of whatever you want! This day doesn't have to be the same every week, one week it could be Tuesday and the next it could be Sunday! Make sure though that you don't eat junk food just because it's your cheat day.

, Pick one day a week to weigh yourself right after you wake up and use the bathroom. Don't eat anything before you weigh yourself. If you weigh-in everyday it will discourage you since you can vary a few pounds day to day due to water weight.

, If the first week you lose 2 pounds, that's great! Don't expect to meet a goal of losing 20 pounds overnight, it takes a lot of sweat and effort.

, Water will help you lose weight, so make sure you drink lots of it. Drink a glass before and during each meal to fill you up, and drink at least one glass between every meal to get a total of 8 glasses. Make sure you drink lots of water while exercising to avoid dehydration. The more water you drink the better!

, Make sure you go to bed at a reasonable hour and get at least 8 to 9 hours of sleep. This will help make you more active through the day, and try not to sleep past 10 a.m.

Look for breast development.,
Watch for pubic hair.,
Notice vaginal discharge.,
Pay attention to growth spurts.,
Understand premenstrual symptoms.,
Be aware of breast tenderness.,
Watch out for moodiness.,
Look for acne.,
Notice cramps.,
Understand the average age range.,
Don't compare yourself to others.,
Ask female relatives.",How to Know That Your First Period Is Coming," Your breasts may take several years to fully develop, but when they first start to grow, you will know that you have started puberty. Most girls get their first periods about two to two-and-a-half years after their breasts first begin to develop., Most girls start growing hair in the pubic area (between the legs) shortly after their breasts begin developing. This is another sign that your first period will probably come within the next year or two.You will probably notice underarm hair developing around this same time.

, Many girls will notice small amounts of white or off-white discharge in their panties during puberty. This is usually a sign that your period will start within the next few months., Your first period usually comes shortly after the growth spurt in puberty, or when you are growing rapidly in height. So if you recently shot up a few inches, your period might not be far behind. And your hips will get wider but don't worry. This might be an awkward phase., Premenstrual symptoms are caused by hormonal changes in your body, and they typically occur in the days immediately before your period starts. Some girls experience severe premenstrual symptoms, while other girls do not notice any symptoms at all. The severity of your premenstrual symptoms might also change as you get older. There is no guarantee that you will experience any of these symptoms before your first period, but if you do experience them, there is a good chance that your period is coming!, Many girls experience a soreness, tenderness, or swollen feeling in their breasts right before their periods. If you notice this, you should expect your period to come soon., Some girls also experience emotional changes in the days leading up to their periods. It is different for everyone, but you might feel unusually sad, angry, or irritable. These feelings will typically go away in a few days., Acne can occur at any time, so it is not necessarily a sign that your period is coming. However, if you notice a sudden increase in the amount of acne you have over a short period of time, it may mean that you will get your period in the next few days., You may experience cramping in your stomach or back or a bloated feeling in your stomach right before and/or during your period. These symptoms can range from mild to severe, and they may not be the same every month.If you experience severe cramps that interfere with your daily activities, you may want to treat them with an over-the-counter pain reliever. Exercise and heating pads can also help reduce your cramps.
Talk to your doctor if the cramps are severe and not improved by taking over-the-counter medications.

, The average age for a girl to get her first period is about 12 to 14 years old, but some start much earlier or later. It is perfectly normal for a girl to get her first period anywhere between the ages of nine and 15.Most girls do not start their periods until they weigh at least 100 pounds. If you are a bit behind your friends with growth spurts, your period may start a bit later, too. It's nothing to worry about, so just be patient.If you haven't had your first period by the time you are 15, or within three years of when your breasts first started to develop, you should consult a doctor.

, If you get your period much earlier or much later than your friends, you might feel different than everyone else. You might get your period when you are nine or 10, or not until you are in your mid-teens, and both are perfectly normal! It's important to understand that all girls get their periods at different ages., Genetics play a huge role in determining when you will get your first period. Try asking your mom and sisters when they got their first periods. While you're not guaranteed to get yours at the same age they did, there's a good chance that you will be around the same age they were."

Wear a supportive bra.,
Do exercises to relieve soreness.,
Eat fruits and vegetables.,
Reduce the amount of caffeine that you consume.,
Reduce your salt intake.Salt can cause you to retain water, and that bloating can cause your breasts to swell.This can increase your soreness.,
Use oils containing vitamin E. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that serves as an antioxidant.,
Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Try acetaminophen.,
Recognize the symptoms of regular sore breasts caused by puberty and your menstrual cycle.,
Perform regular breast self-examinations.Doctors do not normally require full breast examinations until after the teenage years.,
Get checked out by a doctor if you notice a lump in your breast.,
Talk to your doctor if you notice any blood or pus.,
Monitor other signs of infection.,
Take antibiotics if your breasts are sore because of an infection.,
Talk to a doctor or parent if you may be pregnant.",How to Get Rid of Sore Breasts (for Teenagers)," When you hit puberty, your breasts tend to get heavier. Not wearing a bra can cause pain because your body isn’t used to carrying this weight around. Wearing a supportive bra can take a load off your body and help keep the pain under control.Consider going to a store where they sell bras and have yourself sized so that you get a comfortable, properly fitting one.;
, Developing your inner chest muscles, which are called your pectoral muscles, can help you to handle the weight of your growing breasts.To do a pectoral exercise:


Bend your elbows at right angles and bring them up to your chest level. Lower them to your sides and then bring them again to your chest.
Do this 20 times in the morning, and 20 times at night.

, Citrus fruits and veggies contain lycopene and antioxidants. These can help in reducing the free radicals that are produced in your body and which trigger pain. Citrus produce helps to boost your immune system and strengthen your overall health.Good choices of fruits and vegetables include oranges, melons, tomatoes, spinach and papayas.

, Caffeine contains methylxanthines which are known to cause pain. They stimulate the enzymes of the COX cycle, a mechanism in your body that stimulates pain awareness, thereby increasing the pain you feel.Too much caffeine can also disrupt your sleep cycle, which can worsen pain.Caffeinated products include:


Coffee and black tea
Many sodas
Energy drinks
Chocolate

, Cut back on your salt intake and make sure you stay hydrated.

, Antioxidants can help protect your body's tissues, including breast tissues, from damage that occurs as the results of free radicals. Vitamin E can also help reduce inflammation that causes pain and tenderness in your breasts.Rub an oil containing vitamin E on your sore breasts. Oils high in vitamin E include olive oil, sunflower seed oil, argan oil, and wheat germ oil.The long-term use of vitamin E supplements to treat breast pain is not recommended, as some research shows this may be unsafe.Evening primrose oil (available over the counter) can be used in the same way as vitamin E oils to reduce breast soreness., NSAIDs work to reduce pain and inflammation.Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen.Follow the dosing instructions provided on the NSAID package, or by your doctor.
Although aspirin is also an NSAID, teenagers should not take aspirin unless a doctor says otherwise, because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome.

, Acetaminophen fights pain but does not work against inflammation. Still, it can provide relief from sore breasts. The amount of acetaminophen you take will depend on your age, so follow all dosing instructions carefully., If you are a teenager who has sore breasts, you are more than likely going through puberty. This means that your breasts are growing and your menstrual cycle is getting under way. It is normal to experience sore breasts at this time. Common symptoms include:Tenderness in your breast, especially in the nipple area. This can be caused by hormonal changes and by wearing a bra that is too tight, or sleeping with a bra on.
Feeling like you have heavy breasts. As fat and duct cells increase in your breasts, their tissue content also increases.
Experiencing a warm feeling in your breasts. This occurs because multiple reactions are occurring at the cellular level, when hormones act on the glands and cells.
See your doctor if the pain is very sharp or constant, is getting worse, or interferes with your daily activities.

, However, it is a good idea to get in the habit of performing self-examinations of your breasts, especially if you experience soreness in the area. An exam will help you discover the issue in the rare event that you have a major problem.

, Sometimes you might feel a lot of lumps in your breast; this is caused by estrogen during your period. During puberty, you may also notice harmless lumps (such as breast buds) that are a normal part of your breast development. If you find a hard, unmoving lump, however, or if you are concerned, see your doctor for an examination., If you notice any pus or blood coming from your nipple while you are also experiencing sore breasts, you should go to a doctor. Pus or blood suggests an underlying infection, usually treatable with antibiotics., If there is localized (meaning in just one spot) tenderness and warmth in any part of your breast, it could mean you have an infection. This localized tenderness does not necessarily need to be accompanied by pus or blood. Instead, you may notice a part of your breast that is red, painful, or swollen.

, Antibiotics are prescribed to combat infections, including those in your breast tissues. Various antibiotics might be prescribed if you have a breast infection; talk to your doctor about which one is right for you., Swollen and tender breasts are an early sign of pregnancy.If you think you might be pregnant, check with your doctor right away.

Get testosterone therapy if you are male.,
Take estradiol if you are female.,
Take gonadotropin injections to boost fertility.,
Get Pulsatile GnRH therapy if you want to have a baby.",How to Increase GNRH Levels1," Testosterone supplements are the primary way of treating GnRH deficiency for men. Testosterone is given either as a patch, a shot, or as a pill. You can start this therapy as early as twelve years of age.Shots of testosterone are given once a month. In comparison, you will use the patch every other day or take the pill daily.;
, Women will be prescribed either a patch, gel, or a pill that contains estradiol. This is a form of estrogen. At first, you will be given a small dose, which will be increased slowly over a period of one to two years.After several months of estradiol therapy, your doctor may add progesterone or progestin to your treatment. You must be on estradiol first before you can add these to your treatment plan.

, Low GnRH levels cause a lack of two hormones called gonadotropins. There are two types of gonadotropin: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). You can get injections of these to help start puberty or to make you fertile.Both men and women can undergo this therapy. Your doctor will decide if you need FSH, LH, or both.
You may need to go to the doctor or hospital for these injections, but in some cases, you may be prescribed injections to give yourself at home.

, In both sexes, GnRH deficiency can cause infertility, but pustule  GnRH therapy can help. Instead of injections, this hormone therapy gives you the missing gonadotropin hormones through an IV pump. Each treatment session can last between one and two hours."

Choose the best protection for you.,
Keep a record of when your periods start and finish.,
Always have emergency supplies in your bag.,
Dress sensibly.,
Change your towel/tampon regularly.,
Find a way of dealing with the pain.",How to Have a Clean and Dry Period," There are a variety of products designed for different flows and different stages of your period. The best way to work out which products are best for you is to work out what type of flow you have (light, normal, heavy, very heavy, etc), although your flow can differ at different days of your period, and then to try out different products until you find some which you are happy with. You should also consider your daily activities,if you are very active or participate in regular sporting activities then a pad will be very uncomfortable.



Panty liners: For use just before and at the end of a period when there is very little flow, but still enough blood to stain your underwear. Usually quite discrete. Can also be used as extra protection when using a tampon.

Normal pads: For use during your period. Come in a range of absorbancies so there should always be something to suit you. Usually quite discrete except the higher absorbency towels are longer and therefore may be harder to hide with clothes like leggings or tight trousers. Can sometimes get some leaking over the sides of the pad.

Winged pads: The same as normal pads but with wings that fold under your underwear to prevent it moving about and to reduce spillage over the sides of your underwear.

Non-applicator tampons: Secure, and few leaks as long as you have the right absorbency. Smaller and therefore more discreet than pads and applicator tampons. Can take some practice to insert properly. Must have clean hands before using. Must change after at least 8 hours because they're linked to an illness - Toxic Shock Syndrome.

Applicator tampons: Easier to insert thanks to the applicator. Less discreet although some are in smaller packaging than others. Come in a heavier absorbency than non-applicator tampons. Should still have clean hands before using, but it's less of a risk if you don't. Must be changed within 8 hours due to TSS.
""Menstrual Cups"": Menstrual cups are made of silicone, rubber or TPP. They are folded and inserted into the vagina where they collect the menstrual fluid. You then empty into the toilet, rinse and reinsert. They can be worn for 12 hours and have no reported link to Toxic Shock Syndrome.
""Cloth Menstrual Pads"": Work in the same way as disposable pads, but you wash them and reuse them. Come in any shape or length you want and come in a range of fabrics. Look for 'wicking' top fabrics to feel dry.;
, After a while you might be able to see a pattern which will help you to predict when your next period will be. Being prepared for your period will help because it's less likely that you'll be caught by surprise when you're out and about. Don't worry if you can't see any regular patterns, in young girls it can take a few years until periods finally settle into a regular cycle, and in some women their periods never become completely regular.


If your periods are usually fairly predictable but you notice some changes such as a missed period or a shorter-than-usual period, visit your doctor to check nothing is wrong, especially if you've been sexually active.
If you have very irregular periods and you started your periods more than a couple of years ago, visit your doctor to check for any problems, and if necessary, to find a way to regulate your periods.

, Especially if you are 'due on' any time soon. Keep a make up bag with a some protection of your choice (sanitary pads/tampons), some painkillers and a couple of coins just in case you need to buy some pads/tampons from a machine. Some other optional things which you could keep in it are; some nappy bags to dispose of used sanitary protection in a nice hygienic way if you have to change at someone else's house, a small pack of wipes to clean up if you've come on your period unexpectedly, and a pair of clean underwear to change into if you've got blood on your underwear. Keep it in a pretty purse or make up bag and no one will know what it is!


If you do come on your period when you have no supplies with you, just go to the toilet, clean yourself up, wrap some toilet roll around your hand again and again until you have a good amount and flatten it. Put in your underwear as a make-shift pad until you can get hold of one. If it happens at school, school offices often have a supply of sanitary pads (it happens to many students), or try asking a few other girls who you're friends with, chances are someone will have some or will know someone who does.

, Wearing a skirt or dress could make you feel self-conscious during your period because you'll be worrying about leaks. If the weather is hot, opt for a pair of shorts instead because this will feel more secure. If you have a uniform or even that means you have to wear a skirt or dress, either wear a pair of tight shorts, which are shorter than your skirt, underneath, or, wear tights with your skirt just so you don't feel as exposed.


If you have a leak onto your pants or skirt that is visible, a quick fix to hide it is to wrap a cardigan, coat or jumper around your waist to hide it until you can get a change of clothes.
Wear sensible underwear. There's no point in wearing your prettiest lacy underwear when you're on your period. Choose a pair of comfy knickers that are big enough to comfortably wear with a sanitary pad. Preferably choose some that are a dark or red colour so that any leaks won't stain your underwear.

, This will prevent you from worrying about any smells or discomfort that can occur after a while. Pads should be changed about every 2-4 hours depending on your flow. Tampons can be left for up to 8 hours without any hassle but be careful not to leave it in for much longer than 8 hours.


If you need to leave class to go and sort out period problems, just ask to go to the toilet as you normally would. If your teacher says no, wait for a moment when you can talk to them quietly and just say that you have ""lady problems"" that need sorting out. Even if your teacher is male don't be embarrassed to say something, they're mature enough to not get bothered by it.
As a sneaky way of getting to the toilet without anyone knowing why you're going, stick your towel/tampon in your bra or in the waistband of your trousers so that no-one sees you with it in your hand.

, Period pains are caused by muscle contractions in the lower half of the stomach. These are caused by chemicals which are present during your period. Different things work for different people when trying to reduce the pain. Try out different painkillers, (not at the same time), for example paracetamol, ibuprofen or painkillers with ingredients aimed at period pain. Bear in mind that painkillers aren't effective for everyone. Another thing which can help is exercise, even though it's probably the last thing you feel like doing when it's your time of the month. Exercise releases endorphins, a chemical which makes you feel happy, which will help to overcome the pain, and the moodiness which sometimes comes with periods. A third option is to have a warm bath or to hold a hot water bottle to your stomach. The warmth soothes the pain for a while, although it's not removing the pain.


If you have severe pain that is so bad it causes you to take time off school/work, and/or that lasts for more than a couple of days of your period, go to your doctor to make sure there are no issues.

Visit the doctor.,
Get a blood test to diagnose hypogonadism.,
Monitor the condition to see if GnRH levels return to normal.,
Join a clinical trial.",How to Increase GNRH Levels2," If you are concerned about delayed puberty, lack of periods (for women), or infertility, visit your primary care doctor first to determine if you have GnRH deficiency or another issue. They can refer you to a specialist called an endocrinologist if needed.

If infertility is your only issue, you may only need gonadotropin injections. A doctor or fertility specialist can help.
If you have not undergone puberty, you may have a serious deficiency. Boys may have undescended testicles, a lack of body hair, high-pitched voices, and small sexual organs. Girls will not get periods or grow breasts.These issues start in the womb and are often diagnosed in childhood.
If you do not have a sense of smell, tell your doctor. They may order a genetic test to see if you have Kallman Syndrome.

, If your doctor suspects you have a deficiency known as hypogonadism, they will do a blood test. They will draw blood before giving you an injection of GnRH. After this injection of GnRH, a second blood sample will be taken to see if your body produces the right hormones.This test can also check how much testosterone or estradiol your body produces. It will determine if your problems come from low levels of GnRH or from an issue in your sexual organs.

, After getting hormone treatment, you will need to frequently monitor levels to see if treatment is working. Furthermore, about 10% of men may see their symptoms completely reverse, in which case therapy will need to be stopped.Monitoring may include:

Blood tests to test hormone levels
Examination of sexual organs
Sperm counts (for men)

, Because GnRH deficiency is considered rare, treatment can be difficult. If you are willing to experiment with new methods, you can try joining a clinical trial. While these trials are not guaranteed to work, they can give you access to cutting edge treatments, especially if previous treatments have failed.You can use Clinicaltrials.gov to find a clinical trial that you qualify for. You can also apply for the trial through this website.

Increase your Vitamin D intake.,
Take calcium supplements.,
Reduce your risk of diabetes if you are a man.",How to Increase GNRH Levels3," Since people with GnRH deficiency have a high risk of developing osteoporosis, you can take steps to strengthen your bone density. Get plenty of sunlight to get Vitamin D naturally. You can also take supplements., Calcium is also very important to keep your bones healthy and strong. A diet high in calcium can help prevent the bone problems associated with low GnRH levels.Eat calcium-rich foods like milk, leafy greens, and fortified wheat products. You can also take calcium supplements., Men with GnRH deficiency may have a higher chance of developing Type II diabetes later in life. To avoid this risk, you should maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly."
"
Confirm checkups and medications before leaving the hospital.,
Ask for bandaging instructions and supplies.,
Make sure you're getting enough supervision.,
Call 9-1-1 in case of seizures or breathing problems.,
Call your doctor if you notice complications.,
Avoid contact sports.,
Keep track of all health records.",How to Recover from a Brain Surgery (Preteens)1," When you are discharged, you should receive documents that list the medications you're taking (with prescriptions) and follow-up appointment dates. Remind your parent or guardian to keep these in a folder and file them away safely for easy reference. Have them mark all appointment dates and when you need to take your medicines on a calendar that will be seen frequently (on a bulletin board, on the refrigerator).;
, It's possible that you will leave the hospital wearing a head bandage covering the incision area and remaining stitches. Before going home, have your parent or guardian ask a nurse or specialist how and when to change the bandage if they'll be doing it themselves, or make sure an in-home visit is arranged with a nurse who will do the changing. Also ask for supplies--most hospitals will provide you with enough bandaging material for the first couple of changes.


If your hair has been shaven or has fallen out because of treatment, don't worry. It should all grow back, and your scars can usually be covered up by even just 1 inch of new hair.
In the meantime, you can wear your favorite hat, headband, or scarf to cover up the bare areas.

, Depending on the home care guidelines given to you before leaving the hospital, you will be allowed varying amounts of activity once returning home. But it is important that your parent or guardian watch over you as much as possible, since head swelling after the surgery can make you weak, have poor coordination, and poor balance., Brain surgery places a lot of stress on the brain, which could make you have seizures during recovery.Tell your parent or guardian if you have a seizure for the first time, are having more seizures than usual, or have seizures that appear different from usual, it’s safest to call 9-1-1. You can have trouble with breathing too, in which case calling 9-1-1 is recommended as well.Have your parent or guardian ask the doctor before your discharge about support for dealing with seizures. You will most likely be taking medication to prevent them, but it's best to be prepared just in case.

, Make sure your parent or guardian is on the lookout for the following symptoms: memory problems, confusion, broken speech, trouble urinating or controlling urination or bowel movements, hallucinations, trouble hearing or seeing, upset stomach or vomiting, bleeding problems, fainting or seizures, ongoing or worsening headaches, weakness in the arms or legs, fever higher than 100.5º F (38º C), a stiff neck, sensitivity to light, feeling tired all the time, or a red, swollen or painful calf.Keep a list of emergency numbers to call near the phone or on the refrigerator.

, After most brain surgeries, over time it will be healthy for you to get a good amount of exercise for getting back in shape after your time spent in bed at the hospital. Most friendly playing and sports are safe, but be careful to avoid dangerous playground activities, and especially any sports with a risk of head injury: wrestling, rugby, boxing, and ""extreme"" or contact sports.Your doctor should let you know when you can start to increase your activity level, and what activities you can do at each stage of healing. You will likely also be referred for some form of physical therapy to help you gain strength.
Have your parent or guardian talk to your doctor about participating in medium-contact sports, such as baseball, softball, basketball, or soccer.
Don’t go swimming until all stitches or staples are removed from the surgery area.Have an adult supervise you while swimming for one year after surgery, since being in the water can cause epileptic seizures., Recovery from brain surgery can take several years, and in the process you will be given many records of your various treatments. Have your parent or guardian keep all these in one easily accessible place such as a large file folder or file box, since you’ll need to use them regularly.


If you are a brain tumor surgery patient, you should receive a Summary of Cancer Treatment, which includes comprehensive information on the type of cancer, surgeries, follow up treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy, post-operative complications, and medications."

Serve others.Learning to give your time and energy in service to a just cause does not only create a better world, it also provides great personal satisfaction and helps you be more loving.,
Reflect on your personal mistakes.,
Surround yourself with people who are loving.Love is infectious.,
Practice forgiveness.,
Write down positive experiences.",How to Be More Loving1," Identify a cause you believe in and locate a related volunteer organization in your area. For instance, if you’re passionate about animal rights and environmentalism, you could volunteer with your local animal shelter or conservation group.;
, Taking time to consider occasions in which you acted out of spite, hate, or anger. Thinking about these failures, both big and small, and recognizing that you were in the wrong, will lead you to act in a better, more loving way in the future.While you should not hold on to or obsess over your mistakes, it is important to reflect on them to discover how you can respond in more loving ways in the future.


For instance, if you got angry at a coworker and yelled at him, think the situation over to find out both how you can make it right and how you can avoid repeating the same mistake next time.
Perhaps you’ll conclude that when you feel angry, instead of responding immediately, it’s best if you take five minutes to practice deep breathing exercises and calm down before confronting someone who frustrates you.

, When you are around people who are full of love for you, themselves, and others, you will have a hard time not becoming more loving yourself. Find friends who support you and minimize the time you spend with negative, spiteful individuals.

, Even if someone blatantly disrespects and dislikes you, you should be prepared to forgive them. To be more loving, you must let go of hate and anger. This applies not only to others, but to yourself, as well. Don’t hold on to your failures. Learn from them, then let them go.


Picture your negative memories and thoughts as little red balloons. In your mind’s eye, imagine you’re letting them go and watching them float up into space until they are out of sight.

, At the end of each day, write down the best things that happened during the day in a journal. Writing down information makes you more likely to retain it, so by writing down positive experiences, you’ll be able to act in a more loving way. For instance, you might write, “My friend Abu is so kind. I am thankful to have a friend like him.” Actively making a note about your appreciation for your friends, family, and coworkers -- as well as nonhuman good things like animals, the sun, and earth  -- can help you become more loving.

Increase your own knowledge about menstruation.,
Discuss the function of the uterus.,
Explain that bleeding occurs when there is no baby.,
Talk about menstrual products.,
Refer to menstruation positively.,
Talk about how the body cleans itself.,
Talk about body parts and functions.,
Explain new terminology.,
Teach your boys to treat menstruation with respect.,
Initiate conversations early on.,
Answer curious questions from young children.,
Don’t avoid answering questions.,
Tailor your answers to maturity level.",How to Explain Menstruation to Boys," It’s hard to explain things to kids when you are unclear about information. Prior to having a discussion for children of any age, review information about menstrual cycles. Read materials written specifically for kids.You can also review diagrams of women’s reproductive system and include diagrams in your explanation. The more comfortable you feel in your knowledge, the easier your explanation will be.


You may want to check out a book on menstruation written specifically for children or share it with your boys.;
, If the boy you're speaking with already has an understanding of where babies come from, this part will be easy. If he doesn't, it might be a longer conversation. Explain to him that every woman has a “baby center” called the uterus, which allows her to grow a baby. Each month, her body gets ready to hold a new baby. To do this, her uterus has to get extra strong, so it grows a lining.


For example, a mother might say to her young son, ""Every woman has a uterus, which is where babies grow until they are ready to come out. Every month, her body gets ready to have another baby and the lining of of uterus gets really thick so that it can catch an egg and hold on to it. If it's time to have a baby, the baby will grow inside the uterus.""
If he is having trouble understanding the concept, you might say the uterus is like a balloon inside a woman’s tummy. By age 5, children should be comfortable with the official names of reproductive organs., If a woman doesn’t have a baby inside, the uterus no longer needs the thickened lining created that month. The lining dissolves and is dispelled through the vagina as blood.The mother could continue with something like, “If a woman doesn’t want to have another baby, this extra strong lining in the uterus goes away because she doesn’t need it. That lining leaves her body as blood and goes out through her vagina.”

, Bring up that women wear tampons, sanitary pads, and menstrual cups to collect the expelled blood. Be sure to explain that this is lining the body made to support a baby leaving, and that the blood doesn’t come from an injury.


You can say, “Women choose how they want to collect the blood that came from the uterus and out the vagina. There are lots of ways to do this. Women do this to keep their clothes clean.”
If the boy is older, you can talk about each product and what it does.

, Before embarking on an explaining menstruation, make a conscious effort to keep things neutral or positive. It’s important that both boys and girls see menstruation as a normal and healthy process, not something that people should be embarrassed about or feel guilt or shame from.Avoid derogatory language that makes menstruation sound negative, dirty, or unpleasant.


Boys may think that the bleeding may be painful, like from a cut. Assure them that the bleeding does not hurt and is not painful. You can explain that some women experience cramps, which are muscle cramps in the body, but the pain does not come from bleeding.
When talking about menstruation, communicate that menstruation is a healthy and normal part of growing up for girls. Just like boys develop facial hair and their voices change, girls start to physically change, too.
Say, “Before her blood comes for the first time, a girl does not have access to her power to create a baby. When it does come, it signals her that her body is ready to have a baby. It’s exciting to have this ability. Now, whether she is ready for a baby is something else!”

, For young children, you can talk about how the body cleans itself. Say, “Girls’ bodies are different than boys’ bodies. A major part of the body is cleaning from the inside out, like when you go pee or poo, or when you blow your nose. When girls get older, their body starts cleaning in a new way. Sometimes girls use special things to help their bodies be clean.”

, Girls have different body parts than boys. You may want to define terms like “uterus,” “vagina,” or “pregnancy.” Say, “These are all body parts that girls have that boys do not have. Uterus is a big word that means where a baby grows. Vagina is a word that tells us where babies leave the body, or where blood leaves if there is no baby. Pregnancy is what happens when a baby is growing inside a woman.”You can say, “Women and girls have different body parts than boys. This is because women can grow babies in their bodies and men cannot. These are the things that women have that men don’t.”

, With older boys, you may want to introduce common terminology related to women’s cycles. Clearly explain any newly introduced terminology. Some things you may want to explain include the words “period,” “menstruation,” or “cycle.” You may also want to include slang terms, like “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo,” or “moon/moon cycle,” as these terms may come up at school or within the boy’s social network.


Keep your answers simple. If explaining the word period, say, “A period is something at the end of a sentence. But it can also mean the time each month when a woman’s body cleans itself from the inside out. It’s a word that sums up a process that happens in a woman’s body.”

, Clearly communicate that there is nothing “wrong” with menstruation blood. It is not embarrassing, gross, or shameful. It doesn’t make a girl “dirty.” If your boys know that a girl is menstruating, tell them to treat her with respect and not to tease her or make her feel bad.


Say, “If you notice a girl has period or blood, it’s important to treat her with respect. It’s not okay to tease her or make fun of her. Don’t say anything hurtful to her or anyone else. Remember that it’s normal to have a period.”
Make sure they know that menstruation is totally normal and healthy.

, Don’t put off all explanation of these issues until kids hit puberty and instead, approach topics gradually over time. In addition to making the subject feel taboo, you miss opportunities to correct misinformation. It can be helpful to start developmental dialog about boys’ and girls’ bodies when children are young instead of waiting until puberty.Let boys know that they can come to you with questions about anything to both establish trust in you and guide their understanding of development in a positive way., Young children are extremely inquisitive and observant. Boys may notice a sanitary napkin in the trash or notice you buying tampons in the grocery store. While you don’t have to go into detail with very young children (3-6 yrs old), address general curiosity as okay and not embarrassing to ask or answer.If a boy asks, “What is that?” in reference to a menstrual product, respond with the name of the object (tampon, sanitary pad, menstrual cup, etc). You may follow up your response with, “This is something women use to keep their bodies clean.”
As boys mature, they may ask progressively more in-depth questions about the process of menstruation or how babies are made. Use your judgment when giving details so you don’t overwhelm them with information they didn’t want or need.

, Children have a knack for asking personal or slightly uncomfortable questions in very public places or at a time that may seem inappropriate to adults. If you are asked a question about menstruation, do not say you will talk about it later or at home, since this will give the impression that it’s an embarrassing subject. Even if other people are nearby, casually answer the question. Do your best to answer the question in that moment.


If the question caught you off guard or if your answer was not helpful, consider doing a follow-up response later that night.

, Adjust your responses to your child’s developmental level and emotional maturity.Think about what concepts your child can grasp and how to break down explanations into smaller parts. Recognize that talking about menstruation is part of the greater theme of development and sex education. Breaking these discussions into manageable parts over boys’ formative years allows you to build on concepts as maturity and awareness increase.Don’t overcomplicate your answers. Speak simply and avoid using complicated metaphors, especially with young children (such as “Aunt Flo” or “time of the month”).
Give as much information as it should satisfy his curiosity. Don’t over-explain by giving too much information before he asks."

Explore her choices.,
Listen to her as she decides what to do.,
Support her as she tells her parents.,
Withhold your judgment.",How to Help a Pregnant Teen Friend1," Talk with her about the options she has and her feelings about each of them. Talk about each option without judgement or pressure as to what she should choose. This is her body, her pregnancy, and she is going to be the one who has to deal with the consequences, not you.


She could decide to have an abortion. If this is what your friend wants to do, encourage her to get to a doctor or family planning clinic as soon as possible, because there are laws limiting abortions past a certain number of weeks of pregnancy (these vary by location). Also consider that there are parental notification requirements for minors to have an abortion in most states (if you are located in the United States). Find your state here: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/parental-consent-notification-laws

She could decide to give the baby up for adoption. Your friend may not be ready to be a parent but not comfortable with the idea of abortion. Her doctor or family planning clinic can help put her in touch with adoption agencies. An agency will assign her a counselor who will help her understand the legal and emotional ramifications of her choice.She can choose to have the baby and raise it herself. Parenting can be both emotionally rewarding and exhausting. It is expensive to raise a child, and teen parents are more likely to be poor and have lower levels of education than their older counterparts. She also needs to factor in the involvement of the baby’s father.;
, Your friend will have an important decision to make regarding what she wants to do about her pregnancy. All three options have pros and cons and all three will likely impact her life in major ways. This is her decision to make alone.Do not pressure her. Do not say things like, “I really want you to keep the baby because having a baby to play with is going to be so much fun!” or “I really hope you have an abortion, because having a baby is going to ruin your life.”
Do not give her advice unless she asks for it. If she asks, you could say, “I think you will make the decision that’s best for you. If I were in your shoes, I might decide to…” and explain your reasoning based on what you know about your friend’s situation.

, More likely than not, she will need to tell her parents at some point, regardless of what option she chooses. Offer to be there with her when she tells them, and help her figure out what she wants to say.Respect your friend’s wishes about how she would like to tell them. Maybe she would like you there, or maybe not. Consider offering to be nearby in case she needs you. You could say, “While you tell your parents, I will wait outside of your house or in your bedroom.”
Suggest that your friend practices telling her parents with you. You could pretend to be her parent, and she could rehearse what she is going to say with you.

, Your friend may choose a different option than you would, or than you think she should. Accept her choice and support her. Even though you may be close and think you know what’s best for her, understand that even close friends may not have the full picture.Keep in mind that your friend is probably still questioning her decision, so do not nag her about her choice. Gentle questioning might be appropriate, like “If you’re sure that’s what you want to do, I’m behind you all the way,” but do not say something like, “I can’t believe you’re actually going to go through with this!”

Focus on gradual improvements.,
Know that you did nothing wrong.,
Expect and manage mood swings.,
Spend time with friends and family.,
Watch for signs of distress.",How to Recover from a Brain Surgery (Preteens)2," Recovery from surgery can be a long process full of ups and downs. By focusing on positive things and not worrying too much about the negatives, you will build confidence in yourself.Each night before bed, have your parent or guardian remind you to write down in a journal at least one way you felt better or stronger that day. Keeping aware of progress in this way will help you to wake up the next day feeling more positive, and ready to build on yesterday’s successes.


Ask your doctor for a timeline of how you should be feeling and when you should start feeling better. Be aware that it can take time to start feeling better.

, Regardless of the reason for your brain surgery, you may have the thought that the operation was needed because of something you did. It is normal to feel sad and confused about what has happened, but there's no reason to feel that you are responsible for what led to the surgery.If you have epilepsy or had a brain tumor, even the doctors don’t know why you have this disease. If you had a traumatic brain injury, remember that accidents are never your fault.


Telling yourself that you could have done something differently to prevent what happened won't do anything good for you. Try to accept what happened just as part of who you are, and keep a positive attitude about your recovery.

, You may be prescribed steroids to bring down brain swelling. A common side effect of medicines such as Dexamethasone is feeling moody and acting up around your parent or guardian.Tell your parent or guardian that this inappropriate behavior should go away as you take less and less of the medication. If it continues after you're off steroids, have them contact your doctor, since this could be a sign of problems with your recovery.


Make sure your parent or guardian understands that if you're being moody or disobeying them, the medication could be the reason for it.
To help you calm down, talk about how you feel to an adult or a friend. Bad moods come and go, and talking about your feelings can help you feel better sooner.

, It might be tempting to want to hide away during your recovery because you feel awkward about your appearance, or just aren't feeling up to hanging out. But remember that your family and friends care about you and aren't going to judge you. They know you've been through a difficult experience, and want to help you in any way they can to get better faster. The best thing they can do is just spend time with you to cheer you up, so try to take advantage of any family gathering or visits from friends.

, If you notice anything from the following list of behaviors lasting for more than two weeks, or keeping you from doing everyday things, have your parent or guardian call your doctor about beginning mental health therapy: sleeping too much or not enough; feeling hopeless, afraid, or angry about the injury or illness; changes in weight or appetite; low energy; crying frequently, or being unable to cry; loss of interest in fun activities; or not wanting to talk about the illness or injury.Tell your parents right away, and have them seek help for your right away if you feel that life isn't worth living, or if you think about hurting yourself or others.

Prepare for learning difficulties.,
Arrange to meet with school staff.,
Explain possible complications to the staff.,
Make sure you can get extra help.,
Mention laws that provide for disabilities at school.",How to Recover from a Brain Surgery (Preteens)3," Depending on the area of the brain that was operated on; the amount of healthy tissue, if any, that was disturbed during surgery; or the kind of injury in the case of TBI; your may suffer some long-term brain damage. Effects of this damage could include problems with speaking and thinking.Before leaving the hospital, have your parent or guardian check with your doctor about the need to see a speech therapist or educational psychologist to help make it easier for you return to school.

, Remind your parent or guardian to schedule a meeting with your teacher, principal, school nurse, and support staff several weeks before returning to school.If you are being treated by an educational psychologist, it may be helpful for them to accompany you.


Have your parent or guardian take along with them to the meeting your health records, and have them share with the staff any documents about returning to school, and potential learning disabilities caused by the surgery.

, It is likely that even after being allowed to return to school, you will show signs of complications from time to time while in class. Give the teacher, nurse, and support staff the emergency contact numbers for your doctor or hospital support team. Also give them a list of what to look for.


Other situations where the doctor should be called include: potential exposure to chickenpox or measles; swelling, redness, or pus around any external tubing in your head; or nosebleeds, bruising, red, black or brown urine, red or black stools., Have your parent or guardian give the staff a list of special allowances that will help you readjust to being back at school. Things to suggest include visiting the nurse without needing to ask permission, attending half days, having an extra set of books at home (to avoid needing to carry them to school), being allowed to wear a hat or scarf to cover lost or shaved hair, being allowed extra time to go from class to class or having someone help you, and using an elevator., If by chance your parent or guardian has trouble getting permission for any of your special-needs considerations at school, ask them to inform the administrators about the three main federal laws that make sure that you will be given the special treatment you need at school:The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504."

Let go of fantasy love.,
Evaluate your your actions.One of the big obstacles to becoming more loving is believing that you are already loving someone at an adequate level.,
Don’t expect anything in return.",How to Be More Loving2," This version of love is less focused on actions and more focused on an intangible feeling. While love does have an important emotional aspect, love is also about acting in a loving way. By recognizing that loving actions are an essential ingredient to real love, you can begin to let go of the notion that love exists only or primarily as a feeling.The fantasy of love dictates that when people love each other, they never fight or say anything hurtful. Letting go of this fantasy will also help you realize that even though you love your partner, they are not perfect. This realization will allow deeper intimacy as you begin to see your actual, not idealized, partner.

, However, your actions tell you a lot about what you really feel and think. Think about the way you act in order to discover if you are acting in a loving way.


Even if you believe, “I am a good partner and give lots of love to my partner,” upon reflection you might reconsider this belief. For instance, do you respect your partner’s wants and needs? Do you show him or her affection? Do you say kind things that encourage them to become the best person they can be?
Carefully reflect upon your behavior to discern whether or not you could be more loving. In order to avoid biasing the evaluation in your favor, ask for input from your partner. Ask him or her, “Does my behavior demonstrate that I love you?” Use their feedback when considering your actions.

, If you do something nice for your partner or someone else, don’t hold it against them by expecting them to do something nice for you in return. To be more loving, give without any thought of reward for yourself. Love should not involve keeping score on either conflicts and negative interactions, or on good things, gift-giving, and positive interactions.If you love someone, share with them all that you can within reason. However, don’t let yourself be taken advantage of. Ensure your needs are met, as well as your partner’s.

Be more hopeful.Everyone struggles with self-doubt and internal criticism.,
Grow as a person.If you are unhappy with yourself, you will have difficulty loving others.,
Accept yourself.Be honest about your likes and dislikes.,
Accept your feelings.If you feel angry, hurt, or sad, be honest about it and tell your partner how you’re feeling.",How to Be More Loving3," Perhaps you hear a small, critical voice attacking you or your partner. “She/He is a loser. You can do better,” or “This relationship will not work out. Being honest with her/him will only lead to disappointment” are examples of the kinds of lies we’ve internalized due to bad experiences in the past or critical parents or family members. Letting go of this baggage can help you become more loving.


Don’t listen to internal negative advice, even when it seems convincing. When you find you’re doubting yourself, counter these thoughts with positive, constructive thoughts like, “I have value and am not afraid to love my partner more.”
Voice therapy -- the process of saying these negative beliefs and criticisms out loud, then answering them with your real opinion -- can help give you more hope.
By taking a chance with someone and opening up to them, you might end up getting hurt emotionally, but you might also inspire them to be more honest and open with you, thus deepening your relationship.
Take comfort in the fact that anyone who uses your honesty and vulnerability to criticize or disparage you does not love you, and you should feel good about leaving them out of your life.

, Many people spend their lives trying to find the right partner and wondering why they cannot find someone they really love.

Their problem is simply that they do not feel good about themselves, and therefore

Get an education. Learning more can deepen your understanding of yourself and your place in the world. While you could go to college, a good place to start is the public library. Check out books on a variety of topics, splitting your time equally between fiction and nonfiction.
Gain fulfilling employment. When you are engaged in work you feel proud of, you’ll have many opportunities to build your own sense of self-worth as you rack up accomplishments at work.

, Don’t pretend to like football, for instance, just to impress your family or friends. Know who you are and be honest about it with yourself, then share who you really are with others. If you have flaws, be conscious of them and try to improve yourself. Do not compare yourself with others. Instead, compare yourself only with your past self, and aim always for progress, rather than perfection.

, Don’t put up a front in order to pretend that something hurtful your partner said didn’t hurt you.

]]

At the same time, be honest about feeling positive emotions like love, admiration, or affection.
No matter what you’re feeling, find positive ways to express it. If you’re feeling hurt, for instance, don’t call your partner names or throw their belongings out the sixth-story window. Instead, confront them directly and say, “I’m really upset by what you said. I think you were being unfair and I deserve an apology.”

"
Give your relationship your best shot.,
Stay attentive to your partner’s wants and needs.,
Do little things your partner likes.,
Use pet names with your partner.,
Support your partner.Showing support to your partner is obvious and important during times of crisis, such as when his or her parents pass away, or when they crash their car.",How to Be More Loving4,"

Holding back positive, loving emotions prevents us from loving as much as we could and should. Sometimes in order to love as well as possible, we need to step out of our comfort zones. For instance, if your partner really feels loved when you hold his or her hand when walking around town, but you think holding hands is childish, try to change this belief and behavior within yourself. Showing that you love someone in new ways can deepen the relationship and allow you to be more loving.,

If you make the relationship all about you, it will be hard to know how to be more loving of your partner. Ask your partner each day after work or school how they’re feeling and how their day has been. Show your concern and listen to what they have to say. Ask relevant follow-up questions when they share interesting details with you., Everyone has different ideas about what actions demonstrate love. Ask your partner about what kinds of behavior they consider loving. For instance, perhaps your partner thinks holding the door open for him/her is loving, or feels really loved and close to you when you give them back rubs. Instead of just assuming that fixing your partner’s computer for them will demonstrate that you love them, ask them directly about what actions they consider loving.

,

Many couples like to call each other “honey,” “sweetie,” or some equally cute term of endearment. You could even use an inside joke to give your partner a silly pet name that only they will understand., However, you can also be more loving toward your partner by demonstrating some simple everyday forms of support.


When you partner wants to try a new sport, for instance, you should not make fun of them or criticize their effort to expand their horizons. That would not be a loving act. Instead, encourage them to pursue their interests as long as they remain, safe, healthy, and happy.
You can also offer emotional support your partner when your partner is having a bad day. Sometimes, showing you support your partner is as simple as listening to what they have to say and telling them you’re concerned about their plight.

Make sure she has taken a pregnancy test.,
Make sure her basic needs are being met.,
Encourage her to stay active and eat well.,
Get her to her doctor’s appointments.,
Find her a birth class.,
Locate a parenting class.,
Help her get baby supplies.,
Keep her connected to school.",How to Help a Pregnant Teen Friend2," Menstrual cycles can be irregular, particularly in teenagers. Your friend cannot assume she’s pregnant from a late period alone, and needs to take a test to make sure. Keep in mind that other symptoms (like nausea, fatigue, or breast tenderness) are not necessarily indicative of pregnancy. Only a test can tell you for sure.You can buy home pregnancy tests at any pharmacy. You can also have a pregnancy test done at a doctor’s office or family planning clinic.

, Sometimes upset parents will kick their pregnant daughter out of the house. If this happens to your friend, be sure to step in and offer shelter, food, and clothing.


You could say to your friend, “I know things are hard right now. Please stay with me for a few days while we get things sorted out. I want you to be safe.”
See if your parents are okay with her staying with you for a few days while things get sorted out, or see if another mutual friend’s family will host her. You could say, “Mom, can Rebecca stay with us for a few days? She’s having some problems. I promise we will talk about it, but right now I want to make sure she’s got a place to stay.”
Have your parents or another trusted adult get her connected to social services., Help your friend make healthy food choices and learn about prenatal nutrition. Make sure she is taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid, which is very important to help combat birth defects.Ask her if she wants to walk or exercise with you. Exercise is safe and encouraged during pregnancy, unless she was told otherwise by her doctor. You could say, “Let’s have a standing date once a week to walk for an hour. I need some exercise, too, and it will be more fun if I can do it with you!”, Help her get to her doctor’s appointments. Give her a ride if you can drive, or take a taxi or public transit together. Make sure she remembers to go to her appointments -- prenatal care is extremely important!Offer to come along to her appointments for moral support. You could say, “I’d be happy to come to the doctor with you next Thursday if you’d like. You can tell me if you’d rather have me wait in the waiting room or sit with you in the exam room.”

, Birth classes teach a woman and her birth support team what to expect in labor and delivery. They teach you ways to manage labor pain, as well as teach about prenatal care and discuss hospital procedures.Find out which hospital your friend plans to deliver at. Most of the time, these classes are available at the hospital. Generally, these classes also will let you tour the maternity ward and see a delivery room where your friend can expect to give birth.
Many hospitals also offer breastfeeding classes. If your friend is planning on breastfeeding, it is helpful to learn more about it and get professional guidance, to increase the likelihood of success.

, Taking care of babies isn’t easy! Your friend may have never changed a diaper or burped a baby. A parenting class can help teach your friend some basic skills to learn about infant care, as well as provide her with realistic expectations about what to expect with life with a baby.Parenting classes can be found at hospitals, health departments, or community centers. You may also be able to find classes for taking care of older children at these places, when the baby is older.
Parenting classes can also address the stress of having a child, and ways a parent can cope and get support.

, If she is planning on keeping the baby, help her get ready by researching and procuring necessary baby supplies, like clothes, a crib, and diapers.


Baby supplies add up fast! Help your friend find gently-used bargains that will save some money. Babies grow so quickly that most things aren’t used for very long and remain in good shape. Clip diaper and formula coupons for her.
You could even throw a baby shower for her to help her get needed supplies. It will help her feel good to celebrate and know that people in her life support her.

, As she progresses in her pregnancy and feels more uncomfortable and tired, she may not be as focused on her education. She may also be embarrassed to be at school with her growing belly and not want to be noticed. Help her find ways to continue her education in spite of her pregnancy.


In the United States, Title IX makes it illegal for schools to exclude pregnant teens and teen parents from school. But many schools find ways around this law and find ways to “punish” the student, increasing the risk of dropping out.Your friend has the right to stay at her current school and not be forced to transfer to an alternative school or into a GED program. Help her talk to her counselor or school administration to find out how they can accommodate her. Or, she may wish to find alternative schooling during her pregnancy. She also has the right to receive alternative services."

Help her find adults she can talk to.,
Look for a counselor.,
Talk to your friend.,
Stand up for her.,
Stay close to her.",How to Help a Pregnant Teen Friend3," Her parents may be supportive, though upset, but she still might want to find other adults with whom she can discuss her concerns and feelings. She may be more comfortable sharing difficult feelings with adults other than her parents.Help her make a list of important adults in her life. These people might include extended family members, favorite teachers, coaches, or clergy. Help her come up with a plan to reach out to these people.
For example, you could say, “Maybe we could go talk to Mrs. Miller after school. Do you want to meet me at my locker, and we could go over together?”

, In some cases, your friend might need more support than a trusted adult in her life can provide. She may be struggling with some difficult feelings around her pregnancy that need the support of a mental health care professional. Help her get in touch with these services.


Connect with your local health department or youth and family service center to help find a counselor. Family planning clinics can also offer referral services.
If your friend is very depressed and is talking about taking her life, call a suicide hotline immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. You can also call 1-800-SUICIDE. Threats of suicide need to be taken extremely seriously., Check in with her about how she’s feeling, both physically and emotionally. See how you can help make things easier for her in any way.


If she needs to vent, just listen. Don’t offer advice or a platitude like, “Everything happens for a reason,” or “It’s going to be okay.”Help her deal with her emotions by acknowledging her pain. Be empathic and try to figure out what you would want to hear if you were in her shoes. It might be something like, “I am so sorry you are going through this right now. I know you are hurting and scared. But I will be with you every step of the way to help support you.”
Understand she will probably be emotional. Pregnancy changes the hormones in her body, making her more susceptible to mood swings, crying, and anxiety. She is also dealing with a lot more stress because she is a pregnant teenager. Be patient with her as her emotions fluctuate., Don’t gossip about your friend or spread stories about her pregnancy. If you hear someone talking about her when she’s not there, speak up for her.You could say, “I don’t think it’s right to be talking about Monica when she’s not here. Don’t judge her choices. You’re not the one going through this.”
Find out from your friend what, if anything, is okay to share with others. Your friend might want to do her best to keep her pregnancy a secret, or she may want to only talk to certain people about it herself. Respect her wishes.
If someone asks you about your friend, you could say, “I think it’s probably best that you either talk to her yourself about it or don’t bring it up at all. I think if one of us were in the same situation we would want to have some privacy and have our decisions be respected.”

, Don’t abandon her during this difficult time. She needs trustworthy, supportive friends and family more than ever.


Check in with her repeatedly via text or phone to see how she’s doing.
Invite her to fun activities to help get her mind off her problems for a bit.
Rally your friends around her and figure out some fun ways you can show your support for her right now. You could decide to slip encouraging notes into her locker, take turns bringing her her pregnancy cravings, or pool your money to help her out with the baby.

Avoid accusatory language.When expressing yourself to your partner, avoid “you” statements, as in “You never listen to me.” Instead, focus the conversation on your feelings, thoughts, and ideas.,
Make time to talk to your partner.,
Focus on your partner during conversations.,
Resist the urge to win every fight.",How to Be More Loving5," Use “I” statements, as in, “I wish we could find a way to talk more honestly with each other.” Communicating with “I” instead of “you” will reduce likelihood of conflict and increase the good, loving feelings you and your partner have for one another.

,

Everyone is busy. Finding time to communicate with your partner in a healthy, productive way can be difficult, even if you do sincerely love each other. To communicate in a more loving way, ensure that you make time for one another either at the start or end of each day (or any time in between). Sustained, structured time to simply sit down with your partner and talk about whatever you have on your minds can bring you closer together and help you become a more loving couple.

Don’t talk about anything difficult when either of you are tired. Being tired means you’ll feel more stressed and impatient during the conversation.

,

Don’t look at your phone, computer, TV, or tablet. Instead, sit with them and stay focused on them and the conversation at hand. You could do this over dinner, in the living room, during a walk, or in some other venue. Wherever you choose to spend time talking to your partner, ensure you focus on them.,

When you and your partner are arguing, sometimes both of you inadvertently escalate the argument to the point where it becomes difficult to disengage. Both of you become more and more angry, and feel the need to win. This is an unhealthy communication pattern. Becoming conscious of it and working to change it will help you become more loving.

For instance, next time you and your partner are arguing, just say, “Look, I’m sorry. Let’s not argue any more.”
Walking away makes you the bigger person. Don’t look at it as giving up. Letting things go takes strength and builds character. It says that you love the person you’re fighting with more than you love being right and winning.
Some battles are worth fighting. Don’t compromise on your principles or let your people walk all over you. Choose wisely when you decide to fight to the end.

Have pads or tampons with you at all times.If you really want to be prepared for your period at school, then the most important thing is to have pads, tampons, pantyliners, or whatever else you use on a regular basis with you throughout the school year, so you don’t have to worry about any unpleasant surprises.,

You can also consider using menstrual cups, which are inserted into the vagina and collect blood at its base. They can last up to 10 hours, and you won’t be able to feel them. Though they aren’t as popular as tampons or pads yet, they are just as safe.
If you have periods and you think that your period is going to come today (according to your period cycle), it is always better to put on a pad or pantiliner just before going to school, just to avoid worries.;
, Though there’s no shame in having anyone see your sanitary supplies, you can find places to stash them if you’re concerned about that. For one thing, you can put them in your purse, but if you can’t carry handbags in school, you can cleverly place them in your pencil case, tuck a pad into the pocket of your folder or binder, or even place a tampon down into your boots if you have no better options. If you think of some “hiding spots” in advance then you won’t be so nervous when that time of the month comes.If you have a locker, use it. This will also be an easy place for you to keep your supplies all year long instead of having to bring them when the time of the month comes.

, It's unlikely that you will leak through your underwear and pants, but being prepared with an extra pair of underwear and pants or leggings in the event of an emergency will help you avoid worry. Just knowing that they are there if you need them will keep you from worrying about having your period or having a leak.


You can also bring a sweater or sweatshirt to wrap around your waist, just in case.

, If you have your period or are experiencing PMS, then you may want to add some extra chocolate to your diet. Studies show that chocolate alleviates some of the symptoms of PMS, and besides, chocolate is delicious. Having a little chocolate can make you feel more stable emotionally, in addition to giving you a tasty treat.

, If you tend to suffer from menstrual pain such as cramps, bloating, nausea, or any of the other symptoms that may accompany your period, then you can carry around some medicine just in case. (Just make sure your school allows it.) You can use Tylenol, Advil, Midol, or another form of over-the-counter medication that works best for you. You don’t have to take it when you get your period, but having it on hand will help you feel better if you’re feeling less-than-great.


Make sure to talk to your parents and a doctor before you take any medication to make sure it’s right for you.

, Your period may not be quite regular yet, but it can help to start tracking it so you know just about when to expect it. Not only will this keep you from being surprised in school, but it can also lead you to take precautions that can keep you from having an emergency, such as wearing a pantyliner the week you’re expecting to get your period, just in case you get it a bit early. If you haven't started your period yet prepare for the first time, in case it's at school.


The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but can range from 21 to 45 days in teenagers and young adults. Mark the day your period starts on a personal calendar, or use a mobile app that helps you track your period, such as Clue, Period Tracker Lite, My Calendar, or Monthly Cycles., Menstruation often causes side effects such as cramping, bloating, acne breakouts, and breast tenderness. If you’re experiencing one or more of these symptoms than usual, your period may be on its way.When you notice symptoms like these, it’s a good time to double-check your supplies. Make sure your “emergency” pads or tampons are in their proper places, and restock your supply of pads/tampons and pain relievers at home.
Wear dark clothing when you expect your period draws near. That way, if you do get any unexpected bleeding, the color will help mask it.

, This allows you to assess the situation in private and find the supplies you need to make it through the rest of the day. As soon as you suspect your period has started, discreetly ask your teacher for a pass to the restroom.


Try approaching your teacher while the rest of the class is busy working. You can explain the situation directly if you feel comfortable doing so, but if not, you could also get the message across with something along the lines of, “I need to visit the restroom; it’s a girl problem.”, If you’ve suddenly found yourself with your period and have no supplies, then don’t be embarrassed about going to your friends to ask if they have any pads or tampons you can use. If they can’t help you, try asking one of your female teachers for help (just know that women no longer need to use tampons or pads after they go through menopause, which happens around the age of 45-50, so you may not want to ask your older teachers).


You can even go to the front office to ask for extra supplies, or ask them to call your mom if you really need help. Don’t be afraid to go there if you really have an emergency and can’t get help anywhere else.
If you need more help, consider visiting the nurse. The nurse or school counselor can explain the ins and outs of menstruation if this is your first period, or help you obtain feminine products and a change of clothing if needed., If you have no better options and find yourself in the bathroom with the new arrival of your monthly visitor, then your best bet may be to make an emergency pad. All you have to do is take a long piece of toilet paper and wrap it around your hand at least ten times until the pad is thick enough. Place it, lengthwise, in your underwear, and then take another long piece of paper and wrap it around the pad and your underwear another 8-10 times, until the pad is securely in place. You can repeat this one more time with another piece of toilet paper. Though this isn’t nearly as good as the real thing, it will do in a pinch.If you have your period but it’s really light, you can also make an emergency pantyliner. Just get a length of toilet paper about as long as the panty line of your underwear, fold it over itself two or three times, and place it in your underwear.

, If you have one available, wrap a spare T-shirt, jacket, or sweatshirt around your waist, especially if you suspect menstrual blood has leaked through your clothing. This should help hide any dark stains until you can change clothing.


If this is your first period, keep in mind that first periods generally aren’t super heavy, so it’s possible that you’ve noticed before the blood has leaked through your clothes. That being said, it’s still a good idea to take care of the issue as soon as possible to limit the risk of any embarrassing leakage.If you discover that blood has leaked through your clothes, change into your gym pants (if available) or ask the school nurse or counselor to call your parents for a change of clothes. Don’t worry about classmates pointing out your sudden wardrobe change; if anyone questions it, you can casually tell them you spilled something on your pants and leave it at that.

, Though it may sound counter-intuitive, staying hydrated will keep your body from retaining water, which will make you feel less bloated. You should carry around a water bottle or make sure to hit up the water fountains between classes as much as you can. Aim to get at least 10 8-ounce glasses of water throughout the day. It can be tricky to drink a lot during school, but you can make sure to drink extra glasses before and after school.You can also try to incorporate foods with lots of water in them into your diet to make sure you stay hydrated. These foods include watermelon, strawberries, celery, and lettuce.
Minimize your caffeine intake, taking it easy on caffeinated soda, tea, or coffee. This can make you dehydrated and can actually make cramping worse.

, If you want to deal with your period in the best way possible, then you should avoid eating foods that cause bloating. The biggest culprits are fatty foods and carbonated foods. This means you should skip out on those french fries, ice cream, or hamburger and soda at lunch and focus on healthier wraps, salads, or turkey sandwiches. Replace your soda with a water or an unsweetened iced tea and you may feel better.Fatty foods make you retain water, which makes you feel bloated.
You should also avoid whole grains, beans, lentils, cabbage, or cauliflower., Though you may feel like the last thing you want to do is go to gym class, it’s been proven that exercise actually makes you feel better when you’re on your period. It’s been shown that aerobic exercise makes your body pump more blood, which lets it release endorphins to counteract the prostaglandins in your body, reducing your cramps and pain. Don’t be tempted to sit in the bleachers with a frown on your face, and get out there instead.


Of course, if you’re really feeling terrible, you may need to take a break from exercise on a given day, but you’ll be surprised by how much better you feel.
If you skip gym because of your period, you’ll be singling yourself out and calling attention to yourself, instead of doing what everyone else is doing and taking your mind off of your pain.

, Before you start your school day, you can make a plan to hit up the bathrooms every 2-3 hours so you can change your pads or tampons if your flow is heavy, or just make sure that everything is in working order. You may be nervous about leakage, and just having confirmation that everything is fine can make you feel better. Though you won’t need to change your tampon every 2 hours, you can aim to change it every 3-4 hours if you have a heavy flow; if your period is lighter, you may be able to go up to 5 or 6 hours but this is not recommended because it can lead to Toxic Shock Syndrome. Also, to avoid this make sure to only wear the lowest absorbency you need.


Taking bathroom breaks every 2-3 hours will also help you relieve your bladder more often. Relieving your bladder when you have the urge to use the restroom can help relieve the cramps associated with your period., When you’re in school, you should make sure to dispose of your pads and tampons in a sanitary way. Avoid flushing tampons in the toilet, even if you do that at home, because you don’t know how strong the pipes are in your school and you don’t want to cause a flood. Try to use the bathroom stalls with little bins in them; if you have those, you should still try to wrap up your tampons and pads with their original wrappers or toilet paper so they don’t stick to the side of the bin.


If you’re not lucky enough to have a trash can in your stall, just wrap them up with toilet paper and throw them in the trash outside; don’t be shy about it, and remember that all girls have to dispose of their sanitary napkins.
Always make sure to wash your hands after you’ve changed your pad or tampon.

, Though it’s unlikely that you’ll have a leak, you may want to wear darker clothes during the week of or before your period, just to keep yourself feeling secure. You can wear darker jeans or a darker dress just so you don’t have to worry about checking your backside or asking your friends to check for you every two seconds. Plan a few days of wearing cute, darker colors if that makes you more comfortable.


That said, don’t let your period keep you from wearing your cute new outfits. If you want to wear something light or pastel-colored, do what you want, knowing that there’s really nothing to worry about.

, Remember to treat them how you would like to be treated, even if they were rude, and to not be mean or insensitive back. If they persist, contact a trusted adult. Try the following responses in the meantime:

""I'm really not in the mood. Could you please stop that?""
""I really need my space right now. Can you please stop that?""

, If in class, a good option is to be excused to the school nurse or calmly explain your situation to the teacher and leave to your locker and the bathroom. Some good explanations without going too in-detail are below.

""I'm having a feminine moment, can I please use the washroom?""
""Aunt Flo has given me a visit. I would like to be excused from class for a few minutes.""
""I'm having a feminine emergency... you know.""

, Whether you’re one of the first girls in your grade to be getting your period or one of the last, many girls will get their periods eventually. There’s no need to be embarrassed about something that affects many women out there, and which is a natural part of growing up and having a more mature, changing body. Your period is a sign of fertility, and you should be proud about it, not embarrassed. Don’t let anyone tease you about it or let anyone make you feel anything other than proud about your period.


Have a chat with your other friends about it. You’ll feel better knowing that you’re not alone in your feelings.

, A lot of people worry about their periods “smelling” or people being able to tell that they’re on their period. However, your period itself will not smell; what you may smell is the smell of a sanitary pad absorbing blood after a few hours. To counteract this worry, you can change your pad every 2-3 hours or wear a tampon. Some people like to wear scented tampons or pads, but this smell can actually be more powerful than the smell of unscented sanitary napkins, so this can even irritate the vagina. But still, you can decide if this is right for you.


You can try out a scented pad or tampon at home before you decide whether or not you’d like to use them in school.

, Your period shouldn’t be a secret or something you’re embarrassed about. Though you may initially be shy about it, it’s important to tell your mother or father about it as soon as you’ve gotten it. Your mother or another female in your family can help you get the proper supplies, make you feel comfortable, and help you avoid having to sneak around with your period. Remember that many girls have to go through this and tell your parents when it happens; the sooner you tell them, the better you’ll feel.


Your parents will be proud of you for telling them. Your mother may even shed a few tears.
If you live alone with your dad, you may be a little shy about telling him. But once you do, it’ll make things a lot easier, and he’ll be glad you were honest and open.

, If you're asking to use the restroom to a male teacher, or boys to hear, you can say that you urgently need to pee, or something else if you want (you don't want to be embarrassed in front of them). If you’re having an emergency or just know it’s time to change your sanitary napkin, then you shouldn’t be ashamed to ask to use the restroom. If you go into school with the mindset that it won’t be hard for you to use the restroom if you need to, then you’ll feel much more excited to go about your day. Ask your teachers if you can use the restroom in class with confidence, or even talk to your teachers about it in advance if that makes you more comfortable.Be aware that your teachers and administrators should be more than prepared to help you with this problem. You need to keep reminding yourself that you’re not the first one to ever have to deal with their period in school!

Confirm your pregnancy.,
Consult a doctor.,
Think about your options.",How to End a Teenage Pregnancy with Abortion1," Missing a period is a common symptom of pregnancy, but it does not mean it is a certainty. If you are late, you might suspect that you are pregnant, particularly if you have other common symptoms such as nausea or tenderness in your breasts. If you think you are pregnant, it is a good idea to take an at-home pregnancy test. Many of these tests are considered to be very accurate, and are widely available at drug stores.If you are a student, your school nurse might be able to provide you with a pregnancy test.
If your at home test indicates that you are pregnant, you will want to get that diagnosis confirmed by a doctor. At home tests are pretty reliable, but the laboratory tests done in your doctor's office are the best way to confirm a pregnancy. Make an appointment to go in as soon as possible.;
, Once your doctor has confirmed your pregnancy, you will likely have many questions. Your doctor is a great resource for you. Being pregnant will cause significant physical changes to your body. Even if you don't plan to be pregnant for long, you should ask your doctor what you can expect.Your doctor will also perform a physical exam, and may perform blood tests or an ultrasound at the visit.
Ask your doctor to give you an approximation of how far along you are in your pregnancy. Many states have laws about when you can and cannot receive abortions. Typically, abortions are safest in the first trimester.

, Being unexpectedly pregnant can be a very frightening experience. You might feel confused and scared. Give yourself a few days to think about your options. If you have a friend or family member you can trust, don't be afraid to ask for advice. Most importantly, think about the decision that is best for you and your health.Essentially, you have three options to choose from. You can keep the baby, you can have the baby and place it up for adoption, or you can terminate the pregnancy with an abortion.
Even if you know what you want to do, it is still a good idea to talk to a counselor. Abortion (and the decision to have one) can be a very emotional experience. Speaking with a mental health professional can help you deal with common emotions. Ask the doctor or the clinic if they have someone on staff you can talk with.
If you can, you may want to talk to the father of the baby to help you make your decision. But, legally the choice is yours."

Locate the appropriate health care provider.,
Talk to your parents.,
Schedule the procedure without parental consent.,
Find a supportive person.,
Prepare for your visit.,
Know what to expect.",How to End a Teenage Pregnancy with Abortion2," Once you have decided to have an abortion, you want to make sure that you have the procedure in a clean, safe, professional medical office. It is possible that your gynecologist performs the procedure; if so, she would be a good choice, since you already know her. If your doctor does not perform abortions, ask for a referral to an office where you can have the procedure.Check to see if there is a Planned Parenthood in your community. Planned Parenthood offers a comprehensive range of women's health care services, and can be a great resources for you.
Make sure to find out if the clinic you phone actually offers abortions. Some Planned Parenthood locations do. Many ""crisis pregnancy"" centers actually serve only to try to dissuade women from having an abortion. A simple question when you phone will get you the answers you need.
There are two types of abortions. One is an in office surgical procedure and the other occurs by taking a prescribed pill. Once you have found a provider, discuss these two options with them.
Ask the health care providers about abortion laws in your state. Some states require minors to have the permission of a parent or guardian before having an abortion. However, you can sometimes get permission from a judge to waive that requirement. Ask the clinic about the restrictions in your state.

, If you are under 18, it is possible that you might need a parents permission to have an abortion, depending on in which state you live. You can find this information out by asking your health care provider about the laws in your particular state. Either way, you might want to consider discussing your situation with your parents. Hopefully, they serve as a resource for you.Find the right time and place to talk to your parents. You want somewhere private, where you will not be interrupted. Ask your parents if this is a good time to talk — you don't want them to be distracted.
Try to remain calm and honest. Articulate your feelings and your needs clearly.

, Many states require parental consent, but there are also ways that you can still receive a legal abortion without that consent. If your parents will not agree to grant permission, or you are unable or afraid to talk to them about it, you will need to get judicial bypass. This is where a judge grants permission instead of the parents.Planned Parenthood has information on judicial bypass and can help you with the process. You can also call the National Abortion Federation Hotline, and they can help you understand the steps you need to take in your particular state.
If you have ever been married, have a child, or have a medical emergency, the parental consent requirement does not apply to you.

, If you feel like you are unable to talk to your parents, it's a good idea to find someone else you trust to talk to. Even if you are confident that you want to have an abortion, it can still be a very emotional experience. It can be very helpful to have a support system during this challenging time. Be calm and rational when having the conversation, and let them know you could use their help.Try to think of a family member or friend that you trust. Ask this person to go with you to get the abortion. You might need a helping hand — you are not allowed to drive yourself home if you've been sedated — or the comfort of a friend to help with the emotional experience.

, When you are scheduling your appointment, make sure to ask how much the procedure will cost. Typically, the abortion pill costs approximately $800. The surgical procedure can be as much as $1500 for a first trimester abortion. It's best to be prepared and know how you are going to afford the cost. This can ease the stress you feel on the day of the procedure.Many health care providers offer sliding-scale fees. This means that your income and ability to pay are taken into account. Often, this results in a greatly reduced fee.
You can ask the doctor if there is the possibility of using a payment plan if you cannot afford the abortion outright.
Try to schedule the abortion on a day where you do not have to go to school or work. Plan to give yourself at least the rest of the day to rest and heal.

, Before you arrive at the clinic, make sure that you know whether you will be receiving the abortion pill or if you will be having a surgical procedure. The pill is typically an option if you are less than nine weeks pregnant. It is effective 97 out of 100 times.If you are scheduled for a surgical procedure, it can be helpful to know what to expect. There are two common types of surgical abortions: aspiration and D&E (dilation and evacuation). Ask your doctor which you will be receiving.
Before either procedure, you may be given medication to help you to relax. Before an aspiration, your doctor will examine and then numb your cervix. A suction device will be used to withdraw the fetus. This procedure takes about five to 10 minutes. But know that you will need time before and after the procedure to fill out paperwork and talk to the doctor.
A D&E also begins with the doctor examining your uterus and numbing your cervix. Medication or fluids will be used to stretch your cervix. The doctor will then use a gentle suction machine to empty your uterus. This procedure will take about 20 minutes, with extra time needed to prepare your uterus.

Understand the physical recovery process.,
Acknowledge your emotions.,
Ask for help.",How to End a Teenage Pregnancy with Abortion3," After undergoing a surgical abortion, make sure to follow your doctor's guidelines for recovery. You may bleed or feel cramping in your uterus for up to a week after the procedure. Your doctor might provide pain medication to help you deal with the physical effects.You will also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent infections.
If you bleed excessively or the cramps become extremely painful, contact your doctor. You should also call the doctor if you begin to run a fever in the days following the abortion or have a vaginal discharge that is very thick or has a strong odor.

, It is normal to feel a range of emotions after your abortion. Although you may be relieved, it is also typical to feel conflicting emotions. For example, you might feel sadness, grief, or confusion.Abortion is a very personal experience. Don't be ashamed if you are very emotional afterwards. Instead, acknowledge and accept the way you are feeling.

, While it is normal to be emotional after an abortion, you do want to make sure you are on the road to emotional recovery. As a teenager, this is especially important, as you are already experiencing a lot of changes in your life. If you feel prolonged feelings of depression, guilt, or anger, it might be time to seek help.Sometimes you might feel better if you talk to a trusted friend or family member. Other times, your problem might be more severe. In that case, ask your doctor if she can refer you to a counselor or a support group. Remember, you are not alone.

Find someone to talk to.",How to Deal With Puberty1," When you go through puberty, you will probably notice that you start to sweat more (especially on your armpits) and have more body odor. This is completely normal, but it does mean that you need to be more conscientious about your personal hygiene. Remember to shower every day and wear clean clothes. Applying deodorant every morning will also help you smell fresh and clean.Some deodorants contain antiperspirants, which also prevent sweating. A regular deodorant without an antiperspirant will not prevent sweating, but will prevent odor.
Your hair may become more oily as well, so you may have to wash it more often than you used to.;
, During puberty, you skin will start changing due to hormonal changes, and this may cause you to get acne. You may also notice that your skin is becoming dry or oily. To combat these issues, be sure to wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser. Applying an over-the-counter acne cream can help you deal with breakouts, and moisturizing can help you deal with dry skin.Acne medications that contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid as active ingredients tend to be very effective.

If you have serious acne that does not get better with over-the-counter treatments, consider seeing a dermatologist.

, Most people have at least one growth spurt during puberty. You will probably grow several inches during this time, and you will probably gain some weight too as the shape of your body changes. If you feel a little awkward in your body during this time, know that you will grow out of this phase. Some people gain weight before they begin growing, and some start growing taller before they gain weight, but both are perfectly normal.It may help you feel more confident about your body if you wear clothes that fit you. Ask your parents if you can buy some new clothes (even if it's just a few things) if you notice that your old clothes don't fit that great anymore.

Exercising can help you cope with anxiety that you may experience as a result of all of the changes that are happening during puberty. Exercising releases chemicals in your brain that are known to improve your mood, so find some kind of physical activity that you enjoy, whether it's swimming, dancing, or playing a team sport., Puberty happens to everyone, but not necessarily at the exact same time. If you start experiencing puberty before all of your friends, or if you feel like you are behind all of your friends, this is nothing to worry about! In a few years, everyone will have caught up to each other.Puberty usually starts between the ages of eight and 13 for girls.
Puberty usually starts between the ages of nine and 15 for boys.

, At some point during puberty, you will probably begin to feel sexual desire. Just because you feel desire does not mean that you are emotionally ready for sex. It is always a good idea to talk to a trusted adult about how to know when you are ready for sex and about practicing safe sex.If you do decide to have sex, understand how important it is to protect yourself from pregnancy and from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The best way to protect yourself is by always using a condom, although this is not 100% effective either.
Oral sex can cause the transmission of STDs as well, so it is still important to practice safe sex. Use a dental dam, plastic wrap, or a condom that is cut open into a square when performing oral sex on the vulva (area outside the vagina) or anus.Use a condom when performing oral sex on a penis.You can find condoms and items like plastic wrap at grocery stores or pharmacies; you may need to go to a clinic like Planned Parenthood or try a dental supply store to find a dental dam.Never let anyone pressure you into having sex if you are not ready. This is a personal decision that no one can make for you.

, If you are feeling uncomfortable about the changes that are happening to your body, it may help to talk to someone who has gone through these changes before. Find a trusted same-sex adult to talk to, whether it is a parent, an older sibling, or your doctor.You can talk to your friends about these issues as well, but remember that they are just as confused as you are, so don't rely on them for advice.
If you have been seeing a pediatrician who is not the same sex as you and you do not feel comfortable talking with them about puberty, ask your parents if you can see a new doctor.

, While you may want to intervene and make the decisions as the adult, you have to listen to your daughter and respect her wishes. It is very important that your daughter is comfortable with the choices made. Even if you do not agree with her choices, you can still support her.

Learn to remove body hair.,
Get a bra.,
Be prepared for your first period.,
Accept weight gain.",How to Deal With Puberty2," Girls begin growing hair on their arms, legs, and around their pubic areas during puberty. You don't have to shave if you don't want to, but most girls choose to begin shaving shortly after body hair begins to appear. It is always a good idea to talk to your mom or another trusted female adult about shaving before you try it for the first time.A manual razor is the easier way to shave. There are many different types available, but all of them should be used with some kind of lubricant, such as shaving gel or soap. You will need to be careful while shaving to avoid nicking your skin. You can also use an electric razor if you prefer.
Waxing your legs, underarms , and bikini area is also an option. This may be painful, but it will last for longer than shaving.
There are also chemicals that you can buy at drug stores to remove hair at home without the use of a razor.

, When your breasts start to grow, you may find that you want to start wearing a bra. Ask your mom or another trusted female adult to take you shopping for one.You may need a different kind of bra that offers more support for sports.
It's very important that your bra fit correctly. If you need help with this, most department stores have bra-fitting experts on staff, so just ask.
Don't be concerned if one breast starts growing faster than the other. They will eventually even out, although most women's breasts are not exactly identical to one another., Getting your first period can be very scary, but it's a lot easier if you are ready for it. When you have your period, you will need to use either a pad, which sticks to the inside of your underwear, or a tampon, which you insert in the vagina. You will find instructions for how to use these on the packaging, but it helps to ask an older woman (like your mom) for advice.It's a good idea to keep a clean pair of underwear and a sanitary napkin in your backpack in case you get your first period at school.
Most girls get their first periods around the age of 12, but it is perfectly normal for it to happen anywhere between the ages of 8 and 16.
Getting your first period means that you will be able to have a baby. If your egg does not meet up with sperm from a man, then you get your period each month. About one cup of blood will come out of your vagina over the course of about three to seven days.
Don't be alarmed if your first few periods are a brown color instead of red. This is perfectly normal. It is also normal for your periods to be irregular at first, but they will become more regular as you get older.Be sure to change your pad or tampon regularly (at least once every four hours). Tampons can cause a serious medical condition called toxic shock syndrome if they are not changed regularly.
In addition to your period, you may also notice that you occasionally have a clear or white discharge in your underwear. This can happen before your first period and will continue after you have your period as well. Vaginal discharge is caused by changing hormones in your body, and actually helps keep the vagina healthy., In addition to breast development, girls will experience other physical changes to the shape of their bodies. It is normal and healthy for girls to gain some weight and become curvier during puberty, so do not try to prevent it.Dieting during puberty to prevent normal weight gain is very unhealthy! Even though you may feel uncomfortable with the changes that are happening to your body, it is important to let them happen. A woman's body looks different than a girl's body, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Cope with a changing voice.,
Start shaving.,
Expect erections.,
Realize wet dreams are normal.,
Don't fret over minor breast growth.",How to Deal With Puberty3," As boys go through puberty, their voices become deeper. This occurs because the larynx and the vocal cords are growing rapidly. Unfortunately, as your body adapts to these changes, you may find that your voice cracks or squeaks unexpectedly. There's nothing you can do to prevent this, but it may be comforting to know that it usually only lasts for a few months.For most boys, this happens between the ages of 11 and 14.

, At some point during puberty, you will notice that you start to grow hair on your chin and above your upper lip. When this hair becomes noticeable, you will probably want to start shaving. It's a good idea to talk to your dad or another trusted male adult about shaving before you try it for the first time.An electric razor with a flexible head is convenient and effective, although it may not offer the closest shave.
You can also shave with a manual razor, but you will need to be more careful not to cut yourself. Always use a shaving cream or gel with this type of razor to prevent irritation.
You will also see hair begin to appear under your arms and around your groin. The hair on your arms, legs, and other areas of your body will become thicker and heavier. You can leave this hair alone if you want, or, if your body hair bothers you, you can choose to wax or shave it.

, As boys go through puberty, they typically begin to experience erections, which is when the penis becomes hard because it is filled with blood. These can happen unexpectedly, so don't be too alarmed.Erections can happen at any time, whether you are sexually aroused or not.
Try not to be too embarrassed if you get an erection in front of other people. They are not nearly as likely to notice it as you may think.If you want to get rid of an erection, stop thinking about it. Instead, try focusing your attention on a boring an repetitive task, like saying the alphabet backwards.You will also notice that your penis and testicle are growing during puberty. Try not to worry about your size or compare yourself to others. Also, don't be worried if one testicle seems to be growing faster than the other, as they will even out eventually., In addition to erections during the day, you may also experience nocturnal emissions, more commonly known as ""wet dreams."" This is when you get an erection while you are sleeping and ejaculate, which means you release semen from your penis. This is a perfectly normal stage of development, and it will stop happening as you get older., As boys go through puberty and their bodies start to fill out, they often experience a small amount of breast growth. This is perfectly normal and does not mean that there is anything wrong with your hormones. As your body continues to grow and change, this will go away."

, Experiment with an eyebrow brush (you can do almost anything with these) and/or an eyebrow pen.

, Be strong willed and stay focused.

, Get good grades. Do your homework regularly and listen closely to the teachers during class. Also don't push the teacher too hard.

, Wash every other day and wash your hair every other day also, or as often as you wish to. Soak in the bath to get really clean and then rinse yourself with clean water.

, If you have really bad acne, talk to a parent or go to see a special doctor for skin. Wear freshly cleaned clothes and underwear.

, Make up can have negative side effects to your skin. If you want to, have some mascara and concealer and maybe real light eye shadow and not more. And if you're trying to get a boy, it won't help to use a ton of make up, it can trash your real features. Let yourself shine!

Take control of your life.,
Be independent.,
Develop and implement SMART goals.,
Strive for integrity and honesty.,
Take responsibility for your life.,
Manage your time.,
Take action.,
Be ambitious.,
Show attention to detail.,
Prove that you're a leader.",How to Be Grown Up," In your youth, it's more excusable for you to behave recklessly or out of self interest. However, as you enter adulthood, a big part of your responsibility will involve thinking and acting rationally.Rational thought requires you to distinguish between thinking and feeling.
A rational person exercises control over his or her emotions, and acts based on thoughts instead of feelings.
Rational thought takes outside interests and moral concerns into consideration during the decision-making process.
To act rationally, try taking a breather when you feel your emotions running high. Come back to the decision when you're calmer and more capable of thinking critically about the issue.
Any time you exercise restraint based on thoughts and moral/ethical considerations, you are acting rationally. With practice, acting rationally can become more natural to your decision-making process.;
, As you learn to live a more grown up adult life, a big part of your focus should be on how you interact with and treat the people around you. Your relationships - which includes friendships, familial ties, and romantic relationships - should be meaningful, balanced, and healthy for all parties involved. This can take a lot of work, but it's essential if you want to be happy and make the people closest to you happy.Whether dealing with friendships or romantic relationships, you should be able to interact with one another as independent individuals.
Be willing to negotiate things so that everyone is happy.
Every adult relationship requires you to give and take a little. The important thing is that everyone's needs are met.
A balanced relationship involves giving and receiving love unconditionally. Your affection should not be dependent upon certain conditions or expectations.

, One of the things many people struggle with when it comes to entering adulthood is putting off things you want in favor of things you need to do. It's okay to spend some money on fun things when you have cash leftover, but you need to prioritize and take care of the essentials first.Identify your needs and your wants. You may have assumed that something was a necessity, but it's worth re-evaluating all of your expenses to see which items can be put on hold until you have extra spending money.Set up a budget and track your expenses. Make sure you're never spending more than your total income in a given month.
Take care of essential expenses first. Before you spend money on anything else, make sure you have enough for rent, car payments, insurance, utilities, and groceries.
Set aside an emergency fund. Whether you experience a medical emergency, a car maintenance problem, or need to replace a broken appliance, you'll be glad that you tucked away a little money every week instead of spending it all on pleasure purchases.
Plan for medical expenses. Hopefully this isn't a pressing issue, but it's good to have a little money set aside for doctor's visits, prescription medications, and other health-related expenses.
Dine in instead of going out. It costs far more to purchase prepared food than it does to buy the ingredients and make it at home, plus it's likely to be much healthier if you make it in your own kitchen.
If you have money left over after taking care of your mandatory expenses and putting away money in savings, then you can treat yourself to something fun. Even if it's ""leftover"" money, though, it's important to continue living within your means and prioritizing how you spend that cash.

, One of the biggest aspects of being a grown up is taking control of the life you're living. In childhood and adolescence, your parents and family members may have been able to help you out in many different ways, but in adulthood you'll need to learn how to do things yourself.If there is some aspect of your life that you're not satisfied with (or that others have told you is problematic), be willing to address those issues.
A grown up is capable of assessing her own life and making the changes necessary to lead a fulfilling and rewarding life.
It's okay to ask for help from time to time, but as an adult you should be able to support yourself and sustain your life independent of other people.
Recognize that no one can change your life but you. Though circumstances may limit how much you can change things, you need to be aware that you have the power to adapt and grow no matter what is happening around you.
Start by making and striving towards goals, being independent, and taking responsibility for your actions or inactions.

, Being independent builds off of taking control of your life. You'll need to be able to take care of yourself in any way you need to. That can include day-to-day personal maintenance, taking care of your home, going to work on time, being productive, and managing your money wisely.Independence can take different forms at different ages. The key is to show independence that is appropriate for your age.
Independence can also involve age-appropriate responsibilities. As you get older, your responsibilities will change, and you'll need to be able to accomplish what's expected of you.
A teenager has dramatically different levels of independence than someone in their 20s or 30s, just as that individual would have different levels of independence than someone in their 50s or 60s.
Look to peers you know and respect for a living example of what someone in your age range must do to be independent.
If you're struggling with independence, try talking to a life coach or career counselor. You can find these services by searching online or in a phone book.

, As an adult, you'll need goals of your own creation. Goals help give your life meaning and purpose by giving you something to strive towards, and offering you accomplishments worth celebrating. Implementing your goals and working towards your next great accomplishment requires you to prioritize your life, both personally and professionally.When you make goals for yourself, studies show that S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, time-bound) goals are the most likely to succeed. A S.M.A.R.T. goal should address the following components:


Specific - narrow down the scope of your goal. Rather than dealing with broad, generalized terms, focus on a clearly-defined outcome that you hope to achieve.
Measurable - decide how you will measure success, both incremental and long-term. You'll need to know that you've achieved your goal at the end, and you'll need a way to track your progress along the way.
Attainable - make sure that your goal can feasibly be accomplished. It's good to push yourself to achieve great things, but you need to work within your capacity at this moment to accomplish this particular goal, and develop strategies to do so.
Realistic - ask yourself whether your goal is something you're both willing and able to strive for. Again, it's good to push yourself, but make sure that your goal isn't too far fetched.
Time-bound - set a clear time frame for you to meet your goal. Don't make it so close that it will be impossible to achieve, but by the same token don't give yourself an unlimited span of time.

, Part of being an adult involves telling the truth and living a morally upstanding life. This can obviously be interpreted differently depending on your situation, but ultimately you should be able to take pride in the choices you've made and the life you've lived.One aspect of integrity involves following through on your commitments. If you give your word that you'll be somewhere or help someone, make sure you carry out that promise.
A life of integrity requires you to stand for something that you believe is just and true.
Morality often comes into play when people speak of integrity, but morality is not necessarily universal. However, moral integrity may be thought of as being dedicated to the pursuit of a moral life (as you define what a ""moral life"" is).
Honesty is often intertwined with integrity. For example, academic/creative integrity requires you to present your work as your own, and to give credit to anyone who may have contributed in any way., Everything that helps you become a grown up builds towards taking ownership of your own life. Taking responsibility means not shifting the blame to others when things go wrong and not dodging responsibilities. Instead, a responsible adult is capable of answering for every decision she makes.Being responsible can involve many facets, depending on your age and circumstances in life.
Responsibility is a life-long process that involves responding to situations and circumstances, as well as engaging with every possible outcome.
Basic responsibility requires you to think things through, make decisions, and take the credit (or blame) for the outcome of those decisions.
By planning in advance and anticipating things that might go wrong, you can more easily take responsibility for the situation as it unfolds in the future.
Remember that being responsible for your own life also includes celebrating your victories. Don't brag or boast, but do take the time to feel good about your accomplishments.

, If you want to succeed as a working professional, you'll need to manage your time responsibly. This may mean putting off things you enjoy doing so that you can get to work on time and finish what you need to do each day. It may also require you to submit reports or projects before a deadline, which means you'll need to be aware of what day/time it is and when your obligations need to be met.Be punctual. Always show up for work when you're supposed to (or a little early, just to be on the safe side), and stay until you've finished what you need to get done that day.
Make the most of your time each day. If something is important or a deadline is looming, prioritize your time to get those projects finished on time.
Use a calendar or planner to keep track of what you need to do and when.
Try to plan out your day either in the morning or the night before. That way you can go into work knowing what will need to be accomplished that day.
If you find yourself procrastinating, remind yourself that the work still needs to be done. Putting off work now will only make things more difficult in the future.
Focus on one thing at a time. Keep a mental note of what needs to be tackled next, but focus on the task at hand so that you can complete it efficiently and thoroughly.

, Action-oriented employees are typically considered the best kinds of workers. That's because instead of putting off tasks or having a ""someone else can do it"" attitude, an action-oriented employee takes initiative and completes the tasks that need to be addressed. This is good for business and can serve as an inspiration to other employees.A responsible employee goes beyond the actions he or she is tasked with.
You should try to take chances and go the extra distance to accomplish more than what's expected of you.
Always ask yourself whether you're being action-oriented in the workplace, and avoid coasting by or doing the bare minimum.

, Ambition is an important component of success. If you don't have goals and dreams, or if you don't work hard to accomplish those goals/dreams, you'll never be able to change your situation for the better.Ambition should push you to accomplish great things.
It's important to have ambition in your professional life, but also in your personal life. Push yourself to be the best person you can be, both on the job and in your personal relationships.
Don't just show up to work to perform the job you have; put in the extra work to show your supervisors that you're capable of taking on greater responsibilities.
As you demonstrate your ambition and work ethic, you may eventually be rewarded with a promotion and/or a raise.

, Being detail-oriented can help you accomplish things more fully and in less time. Doing a sloppy job that's finished quickly will only leave more work for you and your coworkers the next day. Instead of rushing through and trying to get done as quickly as possible, take the time to do the job right.At the end of the day you should be able to take pride in the work you've done. Make sure no stone was left unturned before heading home from your shift.
Don't overlook any aspect of the job. If a coworker has overlooked some part of her task, offer to help or show her how it should be done.
It may be helpful to think of attention to detail in terms of cleaning up a store or cafe. You'll need to wipe down the tables first before you can sweep the floors, and those tasks must be completed before you can mop the floor.
Make sure that every aspect of your task has been completed before moving on to the next task and before ending your shift.

, If you're a responsible and dedicated employee, your supervisor or manager will notice your efforts. Over time, you may be considered for a promotion when an opening arises. By taking ownership of your work, exceeding what's expected of you, and working with your coworkers for everyone's benefit, you will show your supervisors that you are capable of being a strong leader in the workplace.Being a leader requires you to first and foremost complete your own work and take responsibility for your own actions.
Remember that a leader is responsible for the actions of her employees just as much as she is responsible for her own actions.
Leaders should be confident yet caring. If you're able to delegate tasks while also taking a real interest in the concerns your coworkers have, you might make a great leader in your workplace.

Learn to recognize the things you can’t control.,
Keep school and free time separate.,
Write down your worries in a journal.,
Evaluate effort rather than results.,
Reassess your goals.,
Practice breathing exercises and meditation techniques.",How to Be Carefree (Teens)1," If you were to glance at an inventory of all the things you worry about every day, chances are that you’d find at least half of them were issues you couldn’t control. Worrying about these things isn’t just a waste of time, though: it can also hamper your ability to enjoy things you love like playing sports and hanging out with friends.For example, catch yourself next time you find yourself agonizing over whether your college application will be accepted of if your soccer game the next day will get rained out. Think about how and why this particular concern isn’t a valid use of your mental bandwidth, and then do a breathing exercise or read a chapter of a book to cleanse your mind.
As you get more practice doing this kind of self-monitoring, you’ll become better and more efficient at it. You’ll be able to recognize futile worries and dismiss them without the aid of breathing or other distracting exercises, and eventually, you’ll find yourself avoiding these worries altogether.;
, Leisure time is essential for everyone. It affords your stressed-out brain some time to regroup, recuperate, and reinvigorate, while elevating your mood and overall health.Even if you’re affording yourself plenty of recreational time outside of school, though, you might not be taking full advantage of it.

For example, if you’re thinking about your Biology exam while halfheartedly watching a movie with friends, you’re actually cheating yourself out of the benefits of meaningful relaxation. Make a rule with friends and family that down-time stays down, so no school topics or grade-stressing allowed!

, It may seem counterintuitive, but devoting your worries to a journal or blog can make a huge impact on your stress levels. You get to reflect on them and understand what things typically trigger your anxiety. Just be sure to let your worries go after writing them down: allow yourself to worry for the time it takes to write your journal entry, but call it quits once you’re done. Watch a movie, read a short article on your favorite website, or go for a jog to clear your head.For example, devote a chunk of your daily entries to problems and frustrations from the day. After writing about other things, write something like, ""I've been feeling really bogged down by soccer practice recently. I want to hang out with friends more, but it seems like all my day is devoted to this one activity. I almost told my parents that I want to quit, but I don't want them to be mad at me."" Talking through your thoughts and impulses will help you to process your emotions and decide the right way to address your stress.
Studies have shown that it can also help to physically “throw away” negative thoughts. For example, if you write a particularly negative journal entry wherein you vent personal doubts and insecurities, try an exercise where you rip out the entry and throw it in the garbage or burn it. This symbolic gesture can make you feel cleansed of negativity and refreshed from the release., While it’s good to try to get good grades, you shouldn’t worry too much about the letter grade you receive for a particular assignment. Rather, you should focus on the effort you put into researching and writing a paper or studying for an exam. This effort-not-outcome approach has been shown to help process failure in a productive manner while wasting minimal thoughts and energy on things you can’t control.For example, if you dedicated many hours of time to a research paper but only received a B- from the teacher, congratulate yourself for the honest effort you put into it rather than berating yourself for the letter grade.
In the same way, if you got an A on an exam for which you barely studied, don’t crow over your victory. Dismiss any positive results you attain if they were achieved through insignificant effort.

, Setting goals constitutes an important and beneficial part of life: it encourages success, focuses behavior and attention, and builds self-esteem.That being said, not all goals are created equal: stressing out over goals which aren't actually important to you adds unnecessary guilt and pressure to your life while planting the seeds of conflict in your future. So, next time you're stressing over getting into Advanced Physics, ask yourself why you're doing so: is it because you truly care about the subject, or is it because your mother expects you to get into a prestigious Engineering program at university?


If you think your goals for going to business school or getting a sports scholarship come from your parents’ wishes and not your own, try talking to them about your feelings. Chances are, they worry more about your happiness and sense of fulfillment than they do the specific nature of your professional or sports career.
For example, find a quiet time after dinner or before bed when your parent isn’t distracted by work or household problems. Approach your parent and say, “Hey, can we talk about my plans for college? I’ve been thinking that I’m not so sure I want to go into Business as we had planned. What do you think?” Be calm, respectful, and open to their opinions, but also firm about asserting your own point of view., Mindfulness exercises like meditation and controlled breathing can be useful. The tangible benefits of these mental exercises has been well documented. In addition to making you feel more centered and clear-minded, it can help lower your blood pressure and anxiety while boosting your immune system.These exercises are deceptively difficult to master, so make sure you start out small. Find a few quiet minutes in your day when you can practice some slow breathing and focusing on your breath and body posture, and then slowly work up to deeper meditation techniques."
"
Mix up your daily routines and tasks.,
Take up a new hobby.,
Say 'yes' to new opportunities.,
Try adventurous activities.",How to Be Carefree (Teens)2," It can be easy to fall into a rut with your schedule and feel like every day resembles the one before. Just because many of your daily activities are the same, though, doesn’t mean that your routine has to be unchanging and boring. On the contrary, even little variations in your routine can make a big difference in your life, making you pay sharper attention to what you’re doing and think more creatively about your work and life.Simply trying a new cuisine for dinner can inject variety into your life while motivating you through the less exciting, mandatory segments of your schedule. For example, schedule dinner with some friends at a new restaurant so that you have this exciting prospect to look forward to after school or soccer practice.
If you’re feeling bored with your daily jog or workout routine at the gym, try something different like a pilates class or try a new weight machine! You’ll work new muscles, re-engage your mind, and maybe even meet some new friends., Studies have shown that new hobbies and skills can elevate your self-esteem, amp up your energy levels, and make you feel more satisfied with life. And, while you might think your day is already jam-packed with class, sports, and other extracurricular activities, you’d be surprised how little time a new hobby can demand from you and how much it can add to your life.For example, if you have work or club commitments until dinner time, think about trying out a low-key hobby that you can do at home, either alone or with other family members. Jigsaw puzzles, complicated card games like bridge, knitting, and cooking are all rewarding, affordable hobbies which are easy to fit into the evening.
If you’re already overextended in your evenings, think about whether or not you could fit something into the morning hours before school. For example, swimming, jogging, and reading are all beneficial health-wise, and they can also have a positive influence on your mood and performance throughout the rest of the day.

, It might seem like your daily routine is monotonous through no choice of your own—that is, it seems like you’re required to do the same things every day and given little opportunity to do something different. You’d be surprised, though, how many opportunities you turn down in favor of maintaining your routine. Saying ‘yes’ more often can relieve pent-up stress, broaden your horizons, and bolster your self-esteem and interest in life.Just because you take your friend up on their last-minute invite to a concert or hockey game, doesn’t mean you have to slack on your other responsibilities. Make a deal with yourself to do your homework in the car on the way to the concert, or ask a family member to cover your afternoon babysitting gig.

, Many activities are too expensive or impractical to turn into regular hobbies—for example, hot air ballooning, white-water rafting, or skydiving—but there are also plenty more affordable options, such as hiking, camping, geocaching, and laser tag. These kinds of exciting, outdoorsy activities have been shown to have long-lasting impacts on people’s lives and perspectives, making them feel more appreciative about what they have, less bothered by petty concerns, and more self-confident about their abilities.If money is an issue, save up over time for big recreational treats like helicopter rides or rafting. Tell your parents about your goal and ask if they’d be willing to contribute to your savings if you consider it a birthday or holiday present.

Do fun things that make you laugh.,
Spend less time with people who make you anxious.,
Simplify your life.,
Do regular physical exercise.,
Get nine hours of sleep a night.",How to Be Carefree (Teens)3," While it’s important to follow through on your commitments and fulfill your responsibilities, it’s also important to do things that you love. Carve out a portion of each day when you can participate in activities which make you laugh and feel happy, even if you can’t get school credit for them or put them on your college application. After all, time spent laughing doesn’t just cheer you up in the short-term: it also stimulates blood flow and oxygen levels, thus reducing physical and mental stress.If it feels like you can’t find a spare minute in the day, try to combine your recreational activities with things you have to do. For example, let yourself watch your favorite comedy while you run on the treadmill or make posters for your school club.

, Most people have a friend or two who stresses them out. Maybe they make every situation dramatic, or they demand tons of emotional energy from you, or they tend to say passive-aggressive things that make you feel insecure. Whatever the case, you can lower your stress levels significantly by cutting these people out of your life and spending time with those who make you happy, energized, and positive about life.If you know a friend makes you anxious or sad, but you don’t want to lose them entirely, try talking to them. Say something like, “I really value your friendship, but I get stressed out when you say mean things about our other friends. Could you tone it down so that we can continue to hang out in the future?”

, In general, it’s good to be busy. A full schedule helps you avoid boredom and fight depression, but it can also apply unhealthy amounts of stress on your life and mind. Ask yourself how many of your commitments make you feel good and rewarded, and if any of them seem to strain you more than the others. If one or more of your activities stress you out and keep you up at night, you should consider cutting them out of your life. This simplification will free up some time in your schedule to do something you love, as well as make you more productive and engaged in the activities you continue.This doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing negotiation. For example, if you feel your babysitting workload or volunteering is taking up too much time but you still love it in principle, consider reducing your weekly hours. Ask a coach, parent, or boss to help you tweak your schedule to make it more manageable and rewarding.

, It might seem that physical exertion will sap your energy and make you feel even more exhausted, but in fact regular physical exercise will energize your body, increase your stamina, and positively impact your mood. Aim to get at least twenty minutes of aerobic exercise—for example, jogging, brisk walking, or cycling—a day in order to release natural endorphins, improve performance and brain power, and boost your immune system.If you already spend a lot of your time shut up alone in your room doing homework or studying, consider taking up a group physical activity such as rowing or yoga. This will give you all the physical benefits of running or cycling while also providing a valuable social stimulus.

, According to recent studies, teenagers are one of the most sleep-deprived demographics in society. This lack of sleep both reflects heightened stress levels and causes them.Not only does this nine hour downtime allow your brain and body some precious time to unplug from daily worries, it also enhances your performance in school and sports while brightening your overall mood.Some concrete ways to improve sleep include being more active during the day, limiting caffeine intake, and removing distractions such as laptops and television in the bedroom.If you’re feeling sleepy in the middle of the afternoon, don’t assume you have to fight through the drowsiness. Instead, take a twenty-minute nap to recharge your energy reserves and freshen your perspective on the task at hand."

Follow the rules.,
Use your manners.,
Clean up after yourself.,
Develop smart and healthy habits.",How to Be a Mature Teenager1," If you want to act in a mature fashion, you need to respect authority. No matter where you go—home, school, or work—you will have to obey rules set by authority figures. In most cases, these rules are set to keep you and others safe, so comply with them.


It’s normal for teens to want to push back against authority sometimes. If you want to discuss rules with authority figures, argue your case in a respectful manner. That way, the adult is more likely to listen.For example, you might say, “Mom and Dad, I’m fifteen now and I think I deserve a later curfew. I always come home on time and I never get into trouble. What do you say?”;
, Having good manners shows respect. Proper behavior also helps adults see you as more mature. Good manners cover a wide range of behaviors: saying “yes, sir/ma’am,” answering the phone with “hello,” not interrupting others’ conversations, chewing with your mouth closed, and holding the door for the person walking behind you.Many rules of etiquette may already have been explained to you. However, you can ask your parents or other adults, “How can I show good manners?” to learn more.

, A mature person doesn’t expect others to go around cleaning up their messes. If you’re a teen trying to be mature, then you’ll want to start picking up behind yourself. This means putting your plate away after meals and wiping up any spills. You should also return games, movies, or books to their proper place after using them.


Keep your room tidy by tossing dirty clothes in the laundry and putting away clean clothes in drawers or in the closet. Make your bed each morning immediately after you get up. Place your book bag on a hook behind the door to keep it off the floor. Line up shoes under your bed or on shelves in your closet so you and your parents don’t trip over them.
Make it easier to tidy by setting a timer for 20 minutes and doing a deep-clean of your room once a day. Play some music to make the time go faster., A mature teen knows to say “no” to delinquent behaviors. Using alcohol and drugs, lying, stealing, fighting, acting recklessly, or destroying others’ property will only get you into trouble or hurt. Instead, be drug-free, wear your seat belt when driving or riding in a car, and stay away from negative influences."

If you don’t know how to have fun, think of how you did it as a kid.",How to Be a Young Adult," You’ve probably heard many grumpy adults tell you that your generation is ungrateful and immature. This attitude is, like your becoming a young adult, just another natural transition in life. Their generation (and each before it) was filled with 18 year olds who didn’t want to grow up. Though this transition has always been difficult for humans, it is still very important to accept the challenge. Life isn’t always enjoyable, but maturing proactively can make it a little easier.;
, This is important, firstly, because they are probably the most emotionally and financially equipped people to offer help when you need it. There are also larger reasons for respecting your parents. You have a lifelong bond that can be an incredible source of strength for everyone involved. Sure, you may have quarreled while you were growing up, but it’s time to do the adult thing and put your differences aside.

, The emotional and daily struggles you have as a young adult have been around forever. You’re not the first person to experience them, so check in every now and then with an adult you look up to. They can help you through problems and offer advice on how to ‘be an adult’ in a given situation.


Having a mentor to talk to is also an important part of maintaining mental health. The early adult years are when you are most susceptible to showing signs of mental illness.Let someone help you keep your blossoming feelings under control.

, The key to surviving the work culture of the 21st century is forgetting the clichéd question “what do I want to do for the rest of my life?” Almost no one these days will work for one company their entire life, much less have anyone job title. The best thing to do at 18 years old is think about general tasks you enjoy, and environments you enjoy being in. See this guide for a detailed description of the process of choosing a career.


For example, if you keep your room tidy and keep track of all your expenses, you may enjoy a job in logistics or data management.
Your ideal work environment may be as simple as indoor or outdoor. Or, for example, if you enjoy concerts, you should look into careers in audio engineering or event planning.
You shouldn’t forget about your teenage dreams and hobbies, but most people aren’t going to become successful rock stars. Consider putting off spending too much time on unrealistic dreams until they are a viable way to earn a living.
Getting a part time job while you explore your career options is a great idea. Just don’t get complacent with a job that doesn’t fill you with self-respect just because it puts a few bucks in your pocket.

, It is important to have fun, but you should start thinking of ways to enjoy the world as an adult. There is a world of culture that you may have previously found dull or uninteresting. Now that you have matured some, try those activities again and see what all the rage is about – there is probably a reason ‘adult’ hobbies have been around so long.


For example, try to spend less time watching cartoons and more time reading.
Or, try going to a music concert that is not rock or pop music.
You don’t need to force yourself to tolerate activities you still don’t enjoy, but try to expose yourself to them and see how you like them.

, If you live in an area that allows you to move out of your parents’ house, do it! You may have to have roommates the first few years, but see that as an opportunity. Unlike high school friends, who often move in opposite directions, the friends you make as a young adult are probably there to stay. Roommates you have as a young adult can become lifelong friends.you will learn to be mature and responsible. Check out this guide for more on choosing an apartment.


Look at the neighborhood. You want to factor in accessibility, safety, public transportation, and nearby amenities.
Make a budget. After rent, utilities, renter’s insurance, and any other housing related expenses, you shouldn’t be spending more than one-third of your monthly income.
Find roommates at a similar place in life. You may be able to successfully live with older or younger roommates later, but keep your life more simple by rooming with like-minded people in this phase of your life.
If you’re still in high school, you shouldn’t move into an apartment just yet – this advice is for a little later.

, Think about where you want your life to be in five years. This will be important in giving your life a sense of direction, but don’t feel bound to it. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans. Therefore, write down where you want to be in a few months, or next year. This should be a smaller, more achievable goal that will make your daily life more enjoyable.


Long-term goals involve personal relationships, whether or not to attend college, being in an ideal career or job title, etc. These should be something you strive for, so making a plan is a good idea. However, be aware that your plan will change. For example, marriage may happen when you don’t expect it to, and not happen when you want it to. Be ready to roll with the punches.
Short term goals may simply be, for example, that you want to start a weekly exercise regimen by next summer. Or, you may want to simply get a part time job in the next couple months while you explore career options.

, Students can’t work enough to cover all college and living expenses in today’s economy. However, you should limit how much you’re in debt, both to banks and to your parents. Even though they may not expect you to pay them back, this ‘debt’ will linger in your subconscious. Start learning budgeting and pragmatism by limiting how financially dependent you are on your parents., Your parents have been around longer than you have, and may have even attended college. Let them suggest time management and organizational skills while you are a student. Though they may not personally know your professors, they have come across many types of people in their life, and may have helpful advice for you.


Parents may be a good source for relationship advice. Now that you’re a little older and more or less on your own, they may be able to identify with your relationship problems better than a few years ago.
Seek advice from your parents about your resume. It is never too early to begin racking up experiences that will help you get jobs and promotions, so ask them what you should be doing in addition to school.

, Though listening to your parents is important, take this time to find yourself. Don’t simply parrot their opinions around your friends, and force yourself to emulate their daily routine. Do some critical thinking about what you believe and how you want to live your life. The more proud parents may not appreciate this, but they should respect you for it later in life.

, You will make mistakes as a young adult – everyone does. The important part is to solve the problems yourself, with as little aid from your parents as possible. Of course, it’s ok to ask their advice. However, calling your dad when you clog the dorm toilet is not a good way to solve the problem. Get a plunger and fix it yourself.This extends to much more serious problems than a clogged toilet. If you didn’t plan your budget well, and are running out of money a month too early, try to find a way to solve the problem. Consider getting a short-term part-time job or checking the classifieds for little gigs.

, While you should be developing adult skills during your college years, the reason you’re there is to learn. Go to class on time, speak up, and respect the professor. They will be writing you recommendation letters in a few years. A high GPA can come in very handy down the road in ways you never expected.


For example, if you decide to go back for a graduate degree later on, having put in the effort to get a 3.5 GPA instead of a 2.5 can be a real life saver.

, Waking up at 6am and going to bed at 10pm is not for everyone. However, this is a natural schedule most adults eventually gravitate toward. It is also the schedule you will probably need to abide by if you get a full time job one day. Make the transition easier on yourself by getting in this rhythm when you have fewer responsibilities early in the day.


It is easy for many college students to schedule all classes in the late morning, at the earliest. Try giving yourself a reason to get up earlier in the day by signing up for the earlier courses instead.

, If you are taking a full load of courses, this may not be very doable. However, it is a good way to make the burden of loan debt and borrowing money from your parents easier. It also builds your resume with actual work experience, even if it is unrelated to the career you envision. Finally, a job teaches you important interpersonal and time management skills that you will need for the rest of your life.

, If you don’t go to college immediately, you need to start building your personal wealth. It is a good idea to go ahead and get a part-time job, even as you search for something you would enjoy more. It is easy for job searches to drag on much longer than you intend, and you can always quit a little part-time job.


Getting a job as a restaurant server is fairly easy, and quick turnover is expected in that industry.
Other service industry jobs like cashiering are easy to get and relatively painless to quit.
Who knows, this little job may open up a new world to you that you want to work in.

, In the internet age, machines do much of our work for us, limiting the number of jobs available. You may only have a crappy job right now, and think you deserve much more. You probably do deserve more, but look at this period as putting in your time. The best way to get promoted or impress your bosses is to put in a hard day’s work for your own sake if no one else’s.


Look at the part-time job for what it is – a way to pay the bills and save up some money while you figure out what you want to do with the next part of your life.
Try living day-to-day if you hate your job. If it was a beautiful day and a customer gave you positive feedback, put today in the ‘win column.’
Being grateful doesn’t mean you should accept your unenjoyable job indefinitely. Look around for openings at night, and apply to jobs you think you won’t get. If you don’t apply for these jobs, you’ll never have the possibility of getting lucky with a job offer from your dream company.

, Putting part of your paycheck into your savings account is going to be useful down the road when you want a house or car. The best way to save money is to keep track of all of your income and expenditures. Give yourself a weekly budget for food and outings, and stick to it. You can even itemize trips to see family and friends if you know how much you’ll spend on gas and food.


If your paycheck doesn’t automatically subtract income tax, put away some money every month for this. You should be saving somewhere between 20% and 30%, depending on your tax bracket., If you are relatively stable, this is a good way to build good credit. However, it is also a liability if you are a student or don’t make enough money to add an extra bill each month. After all, you build credit just by paying your other bills, like rent and your car payment. Since only half of people under 25 in many areas get credit cards, whether or not you should depends on your situation. Do some budgeting and ask your parents and mentors what they think., Getting out of your parents’ house means you have less supervision and only self-imposed curfews. It’s easy to start going out 4 nights a week, or more. However, this will likely become expensive and get in the way of performing well in your job. Furthermore, developing early alcohol dependence may set the stage for abuse later in life. Try not to go out more than once or twice a week.

, You were probably used to having free groceries at your parents’ house and going out to eat otherwise. This is an expensive and generally unhealthy way to live. Force yourself to buy groceries, and plan on cooking them at home to save money.


Buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Starting adulthood with a healthy diet is important to form good habits and a good relationship with food.

, This is more of a metaphor for making food or doing activities at home that are much more expensive elsewhere. You can, for example, pick up a deluxe coffee on your way to work one day. However, coffee by the pound is much cheaper, and can be made to taste better.


As far as activities go, consider seeing movies at home rather than going to the movie theater every time, for example. The more you commit to outings, the more time and money you will lose.

, Too many young adults can’t perform basic household tasks. Fixing the toilet and checking the oil in your car are basic tasks you should know how to do. This can-do attitude will transfer into your workplace. You will find that your supervisors will be much more impressed with someone who knows how to do random little things that help the office from day to day. This could mean fixing a squeaky chair or identifying a serious problem with the company truck’s hydraulic system.
Being handy at home also helps you avoid unnecessary repair expenses.

, You don’t have the shelter of people treating you like a kid anymore. You will need to make decisions carefully and for good reason. Afterwards, accept the consequences whether they are positive or negative. Apologize if you made a mistake, but focus on not making that mistake again. Older adults will respect you for this.

, You don’t always need to blindly accept the world as it is. However, this is a ‘pick your battles’ situation. Reinventing the wheel every time you walk out the door will make it impossible for you to actually live your life.


For example, you may not like paying local taxes. However, this is an important part of maintaining basic services and infrastructure. Get involved in local government to learn more about why the laws and regulations are the way they are.
You also may not like that you are expected to get married and have children. Talk to your parents about how and why they eventually came to terms with having children.

, Part of being an adult is shaping a better future. This involves community service and caring about education. Volunteer at your local school or community center, or find a way to be a role model for a younger teen or child., Your hobbies from childhood will not likely become your career, but that doesn’t mean you need to quit doing them. If you are good at a hobby, sharing it with the community is a good way to give back. Find ways to show the world your talents.


For example, if you were in orchestra growing up, audition for community orchestras as an adult.
Or, if you were in boy scouts, volunteer as a troop leader.
If you are good at public speaking, volunteer to give children’s sermons at church, for example.

, Wearing more than sweats every day conveys a message to others and boosts your self-confidence.Of course, you shouldn’t be uncomfortable or dress in outdated attire. There are, nonetheless, noticeable perks of not being the laziest dresser in the room. Wear a basic pair of pants and shoes with laces on casual days, and emulate those around you at work.

, After all this, it is important to remember that being an adult isn’t such serious business. Find hobbies that make you happy, and play! Sports, board games, and just running are perfectly acceptable activities for adults to have. Remember to really punch the clock at the end of the workday, and try to be a kid every once in a while.


Turn off the TV.Passive activities like this don’t stimulate your brain, and are not as rewarding as other ways of having fun.

, Doing little craft projects or playing video games isn’t illegal now that you are an adult.Think about fun ways to exercise. Since you won’t have as much time to have fun and get exercise, combining the two is a good idea. Play sports in your community or find a running buddy. This will keep you from having to double book yourself for exercise and social events as well.
Engage with fun art forms. Try out painting, or get into art house films. It is easy to turn art into a fun hobby."

, Take dance lessons or rent DVD's on how to dance. Follow the rhythm of the beat. If a girl/woman asks you to dance never say ""no"" but you only are obligated to dance one dance with her. Make sure you look directly at your dancing partner, not all over the around the room. Always say ""thank you"" afterwards., for presents. It is hard to do sometimes but it lets the other person know that you got the gift. E-mails do not count!"

Don’t take your emotions out on others.,
Take ownership for your behavior.,
Think before acting.,
Practice gratitude.",How to Be a Mature Teenager2," To be mature, you’ll have to get a handle on the uncomfortable feelings you experience, such as anger, disappointment, or embarrassment. Cursing or shouting at others because you feel crappy won’t help you look mature. Find healthy ways to release and express your emotions instead.


First, understand why you are feeling this way. Answer three questions: what happened before, how does it feel in your body, and how would you label the feeling?
Next, decide how you can express this feeling without hurting yourself or others. You might write in a journal, burn off some steam by exercising or playing sports, or listen to some music that reflects your emotions., When you make a mistake, it won’t do you any good to blame someone else or make an excuse. Putting the fault off on others can ruin your relationships. Plus, you will never learn and grow if you don’t face consequences.Step up to the plate and take full responsibility when you make a mistake. Do this by immediately admitting your wrongdoing. This can be as simple as saying “My bad” or “That was my mistake.” If you hurt someone, apologize. Then, figure out how you can make amends.
For instance, if you left the back door open and your cat got out, admit it. You might say, “I’m sorry. I left the back door open. I’ll go ask the neighbors if they have seen the cat.”

, Maturity means thinking about the consequences of your actions. Whenever you are about to say or do something, take a couple of seconds to think about the outcome of your words or actions. Acting on impulse may feel good in the moment, but it can get you into trouble in the long run.To prevent impulse reactions, pause before making decisions or taking any action. Take a few deep breaths. Then, ask yourself why you are about to do this thing and how it might play out.
For example, a friend asks if you want to cut class. You might pause and breathe deeply. Think about why you would do this—maybe you just want to hang out. Think about what might happen if you do it: you might get caught and get in trouble with the school and your parents.
Going through this process each time you make a choice will help you make smarter decisions.

, Adults are more likely to respect and admire you when you learn to appreciate the things you have. Limit complaining about what you don't have. Instead, practice gratitude.At the end of each day, jot down in a notebook three things that went well for you that day. Spend a few moments thinking about these positive events or outcomes. Try to draw in good feelings about them.

Stay informed on current events.,
Read books.,
Use your critical thinking skills.",How to Be a Mature Teenager3," Read up on current issues and events in the newspaper and legitimate online sources. Don't rely on information from your social media feed. Make an effort to seek out other sources for news and stay in the know about what’s happening in the world around you.When you learn about current events, discuss them with your parents or other adults. You might say, “What do you think about the president’s new bill, Dad?”

, Whether you are reading a book about real-world facts or made-up stories, reading can be a great hobby. Reading a book not only makes you wiser, but also adds new words to your vocabulary. This helps you improve your ability to comprehend and even enhances your own writing skills. Plus, reading can help you relieve stress, too.Go beyond the reading assignments needed for school. To enjoy the habit of reading, choose books that relate to your interests, such as airplanes or ancient Egypt.

, Critical thinking skills describe the way you go about solving a problem. You might jump at the quickest answer that comes to mind, or you might spend more time viewing all angles of the problem before selecting an answer. Being a critical thinker can help you better judge the consequences of your actions, evaluate the validity of information, and learn to think outside the box.


A great way to build critical thinking skills is by playing board games. Schedule a game night with your family and/or closest pals. Good board game options include Apples to Apples and Scattergories."

Communicate clearly.,
Use active listening.,
Avoid using slang or swear words.",How to Be a Mature Teenager4," Lots of adolescents and teens communicate in a style that leaves teachers and parents scratching their heads. If you want to be viewed as mature, you should speak in a way that others understand. Use proper words, not shorthand or acronyms. Write in complete sentences with proper spelling.


If you want to learn appropriate ways to engage in conversation with others, ask your parents to role-play communication with you., Many teens assume they know everything, so they don’t want to listen to others. A sign of maturity is knowing that you can learn something from everyone. Try to listen more than you speak.A good rule-of-thumb is to listen to understand rather than listening to reply. Try to figure out what the other person is trying to say. Don’t interrupt or rush to get your message across. Fully hear them out. Then, try to summarize what you think they said.
For instance, your mom says, “I’ll be out of town this weekend and I’m concerned about leaving you at home alone. I think you should try to stay with the Woodards.” You might respond, “I can see you are worried about me being here by myself. I agree. I will see if Pat’s parents don’t mind me staying over.”

, Using slang or other popular terms strictly in the presence of peers is okay. But, when you are communicating with adults, try to use words in their proper form. Don’t try to talk over adults heads by using terms they aren’t familiar with. Also, avoid using swear words, which is a sign of disrespect.

Surround yourself with mature people.,
Learn new things every day.,
Accept constructive criticism.,
Take responsibility for your actions.,
Improve your communication skills.",How to Be a Grown up and Mature Teen1," Make sure that the friends that you hang out with on a daily basis are mature teenagers. Emulate mature characteristics of the adults or role models in your life. Take note of how they interact with people and conduct themselves in public. If you surround yourself with immature people, you are more likely to act immaturely.Find a role model that has a clear set of values and qualities that you admire.
You might find a positive role model in your school, religious community, after school activity, or even within your family.;
, Understanding that you don’t know everything is important to becoming a mature teenager. Be receptive to learning new things. Make it a goal to learn something new each day. Learning doesn’t always have to happen in the classroom. You also learn from your parents, friends, and community members to do things like cook, drive, and manage money.Research things that you don’t know by looking it up on the internet, going to the library, or asking an expert.
Ask questions while you are learning to gain a deeper understanding.
Read lots of books to gain new perspective and spark your imagination. Reading is an excellent way to learn new things and gain perspective on all sorts of situations. Check out books from categories that interest you, such as sci-fi, fantasy, philosophy, nature, astronomy, and biography.

, Be open and welcome to feedback. Getting angry or defensive when you are given feedback is very childish. Actively listen and learn from the feedback that is given to you. In order to actively listen, you must listen with all of your senses instead of merely “hearing” what is being said.Accept feedback from your teachers to improve your schoolwork. For example, apply the comments on your last research paper to improve your next research paper.
Receive constructive criticism from your coaches or mentors to succeed in afterschool activities. For example, apply the tips that your coach gives you during your practice to improve your technique.
Ask for feedback when feedback is not initially given to you. For example, when you receive a bad grade on a paper with little feedback, consider staying after class to discuss the paper with your teacher. Say something like, “Could you give me some feedback on how to make this paper better? I would like to make a better grade on the next assignment for this class.”

, Don’t make excuses for things that you have done wrong. Resist the urge to blame other people, even if they were involved. Own up to your mistakes and learn from them. On the other hand, you should take credit for things that you have done well.Take responsibility for your grades instead of blaming them on your teachers.
Admit to breaking or damaging something even if no one was watching.
Accept and serve and punishments given to you at school instead of asking your parents to talk to the administration.

, As you grow up you will need to learn to communicate more effectively. Effective and mature communication is key to gain the respect that you want from other people. Remember to use your manners and treat others with respect when you are talking to them. Listen to what others are saying and don’t jump to conclusions.When possible, have important conversations face-to-face instead of by phone, text, or email. Try to communicate with someone face-to-face every day to improve your interpersonal skills and avoid isolating yourself with technology.
Focus on what the speaker is telling you. Put away any distractions.

Want nice skin?.,
Want great style?.,
Be nice.,
Be smart.,
Do not brag.,
Be confident.,
Be healthy.,
Be true to you.,
Don't talk behind peoples backs.",How to Be a Great Preteen," Drink about 8 glasses of water a day and cut back on the junk food. If you need use skin products such as Clean and Clear or Proactive.;
, Focus on your smile instead. If you have a smile on your face and your are personable style really doesn't matter...people see past what you are wearing. Actually studies have showed that people who smile a lot are perceived as prettier than when they don't.

, Even if someone is the prettiest in the world, she's not liked if she's mean. Treat everyone friendly even those people who aren't your friends. Who knows, maybe they'll be your friend sooner or later.

, Work hard at getting good grades in school, just being pretty won't get you far. Plus you will have your parents off your back and maybe you can even make a friend, helping someone else understand something. Bonus: You can get extra marks for being a good role model.

, People will be annoyed if you're Miss McBrag!

, If you're rejected by someone, don't make a big deal, remember it is truly their loss. Plus you never know why they rejected you, maybe it something you can't see now but will work itself out later.

, A balanced diet keeps your blood sugars level which helps with mood and concentration. You will be more pleasant if you're not starving yourself and you'll be able to understand what the teacher is saying better too. Again, a little junk food is okay once in a while. Don't focus on weight, we are not all built the same, be happy for being you! Again weight is not a factor in popularity, it is your smile and friendliness. If you're sad over things you can't change, you've wasted precious time of your life for nothing.

, If you're trying too hard to impress people they will see through that and think your fake (defeats the purpose). If you don't agree with something everyone else is on board with don't be afraid to speak up if you need to. Don't go out of your way to share what is not necessary either. But for important things ie: drugs, don't do it just cause everyone else is, that will only throw you off your path to success. Your friends won't care if you do it or not, it is your company they want. Let it pass by you in the circle, after a while you won't even be asked, they will know where you stand. After a while you will know if you want to still hang with these people or not, but at least you are in the frame of mind to make that decision.

, You never know who is friends with who and when that will change. What you say might come back to bite you. If you have opinions about others share them with those you know for sure won't blab, like your parents or a cousin or someone removed from the group you are referring to. Also, never assume people are talking about you, that is flattering yourself, there are lots of other things people talk about and it may just look that way. If they are talking about you, who cares, just think if they want to fix it they can talk to you, if not it is their choice to be upset about something they don't have full clarification of.(keep in mind people are usually upset about things they have misunderstood) Don't start the cycle, end the cycle.

Develop your sense of right and wrong.,
Apply yourself at whatever you do.,
Work on time management.,
Work on quiet confidence.,
Create your own style.",How to Be a Better Person at School1," The world today is fast and impatient, but being a better person involves taking the time to work on your values. Decide what values and virtues are most important to you. Create a personal system of morals by joining clubs and organizations that will help you build your virtues, like a sports team, community service clubs, choir, or student government.Empathy, honesty, patience, humor, and perseverance are just a few examples of good values.
Consider some clubs and activities that might help you develop values. For instance, joining a sports team can help you practice perseverance. Joining student government can help you develop dependability, and doing community service can help you cultivate empathy and generosity.
Think about how you can put those qualities into practice throughout the school day. For example, if you think generosity is a good value, then find a way to really brighten someone’s day by sharing something that belongs to you.;
, Making a genuine effort to do something is an important part of self-esteem and positive thinking. Put your best foot forward at school, in an extracurricular activity, or at work if you have a part-time job. Be able to say, “I studied my hardest and put all my effort into this,” even if your test score is a little less than you were hoping for.

, Work on your school work over time. Do your homework and study a little every day, rather than cram the night before the big test. Don't procrastinate on a big project, especially if it's a big portion of your final grade.


You'll be less overwhelmed with your schoolwork in the long run, and will have time to deal with unexpected problems with the material you might face.
If you have any trouble understanding something, never hesitate to get extra help. Ask your teacher to spend a little more time covering the material with you. See if your school offers peer tutoring services.

, Being confident in an understated way is a great way to approach your classes, after-school activities, and friendships. No one likes being around a show-off or someone who’s overconfident in a fake way, so don’t put others off by being too cocky. Just work on developing your self-esteem and an easygoing sense of pride: you are a unique person who has great qualities, interests, and talents and no one on Earth is exactly on you.Make decisions about your diet, how you schedule time for studying and activities, and exhibit self-control in your behavior in and out of school in order to gain a sense of independence. Independence can really help your self-esteem.
Don’t be afraid to try new things or make mistakes: if you mess up, have the confidence to treat it as a learning opportunity!
Be confident about your emotions: everyone has them, and everyone has to manage their emotional lives. Work on building your self-esteem so you can better manage positive and negative emotions., Wear clothes and accessories that represent you and make you feel good. Know your own likes and dislikes, and express who you are. Dress for success: wear what not only makes you comfortable, but what makes you feel happy and ready to put your best foot forward.


It doesn't need to be expensive, trendy, or flashy: you style should just make you feel confident and happy.
Don't pretend to like something to get someone's attention. People being around will appreciate your different interests and want to get to know you better.

Learn to manage your money.,
Make wise dietary decisions.,
Get enough sleep.,
Develop a routine of daily physical activity.",How to Be a Grown up and Mature Teen2," You may be able to earn some money through a part-time or seasonal job or be given an allowance by your parents. Even though you may not have any serious financial commitments like rent or children, you should learn to manage your money. Create a budget for the money that you have and set some small savings goals so that you don’t have to ask your parents for more money before your next payday.Try asking your parents if they would be willing to teach you about basic money management, or look into a community course where you can learn basic money management skills.
If you get a weekly allowance, list out all of your expenses for that week. Make sure to include gas, food, or money needed for activities. What is left over is money that you can spend or save for things you want.
Resist giving into peer pressure to go somewhere and do something that you cannot afford to do.
Keep a log of your spending and income to help stay on budget.

, Throughout your childhood your parents probably cooked for you and helped you make wise food choices. As you grow up, it is important to start to make some of these decisions for yourself. You need to resist the temptation to eat only junk food when your parents are not around.Remember to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy products.
Resist the urge to skip meals when you are running short on time.
Learn to make wise dietary decisions by helping your parents prepare meals or grocery shop for your family.

, You probably had a bedtime when you were younger. However, as you get older, your parents will probably allow you to make more decisions, including what time you go to bed. Don’t be tempted to stay up all night, especially if you have to wake up early for school or work the next day. Not only is adequate sleep crucial to doing well in school, it is also an important part of your health and development.In your teenage years, you need between eight to ten hours of sleep per night. It is also important to go to sleep and wake up at about the same time every day. This will give your body a chance to perform important tasks, such as healing and detoxifying, which usually occurs between 11pm and 3am.

, Staying physically active is important to maintain a healthy weight, flexibility, and reduce stress. You may get plenty of physical activity through PE classes at school or extracurricular activities such as sports or dance. If not, it is important to incorporate about 60 minutes of physical activity into your daily routine. Log your daily physical activity in a notebook or using a smartphone app to help you stay on track.Take a walk.

Set and achieve realistic goals.,
Follow through with any commitments.,
Act without being told.",How to Be a Grown up and Mature Teen3," In order to achieve your goals, you must make sure that they are smart, realistic, and measurable goals. Setting goals for yourself will keep you motivated without the need for an adult to tell you what to do. You will build self-esteem and confidence as you achieve your goals.Try setting small, achievable goals for yourself to gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment. For example, you might set a goal to finish a paper for your English class. Or, you might set a goal to learn how to play a new song on the piano.

, Once you have made a commitment to something or someone, it is important to follow through with that commitment. It is a sign of maturity if you can follow through with that commitment without having to be nagged and reminded by your parents. These commitments could be short term, like babysitting for a neighbor next Saturday, or they could be long term, like being elected class president.Maintain a planner or calendar to help keep track of your commitments.

, Children are often dependent on their parents to tell them what to do. As you grow up and become more mature, you should be able to be more proactive. Doing things like finishing your homework or keeping your room clean without being told is a sign that you are maturing. Adults must proactively do things each day in order to be successful."

Look for signs of growth.,
Find a point of comparison.,
Stand against a wall.,
Mark your progress.,
Visit your doctor.,
Project where you’ll end up.,
Accept that you can only do so much.,
Skip the fantastic “grow taller” claims online.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Know if You Are Growing Taller," Have you begun to clunk your head on that low doorway in your basement? Have you finally conquered the “you must be this tall to ride” sign at the amusement park roller coaster? Slowly but surely, you must be growing taller.


Short pant legs are an easy way to tell that you must be growing. If the jeans you used to have to roll up now make you look like you’re ready for a flood, it may be time to take a height measurement (as well as buy some new jeans).
Foot growth is another likely sign of height growth. Not surprisingly, since they provide your base, just like expanding roots hold up a growing tree, there is a clear correlation between foot size and height in humans.;
, If you have a brother or sister, you’ve probably stood back-to-back more than once to see who’s taller. Picking something that isn’t also growing, however, is the best way to prove that you’re gaining height.


Practically any non-growing, stationary object — the bottom of a sign on the wall, the ceiling in your treehouse, your father standing back-to-back with you — can serve as a reference point. The closer you get to being eye-level with the sign, scraping your head on the ceiling, or reaching your dad’s shoulder blades, the taller you are becoming.
Traditionally, of course, the reference point for a kid is a wall, door jamb, or inside panel of a door where his or her height can be marked every so often.

, There is a method to getting an accurate measurement against a flat surface like a wall,but consistency is of first importance. If you measured your height in bare feet before, make sure you take off your shoes each time you step up to track your progress.


Remove your shoes, and flatten your hair down if necessary.
Stand up straight, back and heels flat against the wall. Keep your feet flat on the ground and together (no tippy toes!).
Look straight ahead. Have someone use a pencil to mark the highest point of your head against the wall. Another, less accurate method that works if you are alone is to hold a book on top of your head; press it against the wall; turn around while holding the book in place; and mark the spot with a pencil.

, Parents love doing this so they can see how much their little darling has grown!


Mark the lines on the wall in pen or marker if you want more permanence than pencil, and add the date (along with the child’s name and age, if desired).
If marking up the wall isn’t an option, take a tape measure and record the distance up the wall from the floor to the mark. Keep a log book with the relevant information.

, Height and weight measurements are standard procedure at a medical appointment, for kids and adults, because unusual variations in either can indicate possible health issues. For kids especially, healthy growth is a good sign of a healthy body. Your doctor will chart your growth velocity, which is your change in growth over time.


The nurse or doctor will take an accurate measurement for their records; ask for the result and jot it down for yourself if you like.
If you’re over forty, don’t be surprised if you start getting a little bit shorter each time. By this time, you are far past your growth stage, and the effects of gravity, especially on your spinal column, begin to drag you down. Unusually rapid height decrease, however, could be a sign of a condition like osteoporosis (bone weakness, essentially)., Since genetics plays the largest role in your eventual final height, looking at your parents’ heights will give you a good idea of where you’ll likely end up.



How to Predict Height describes several methods for predicting height, including those mentioned here. Be warned, however, that the simplest methods have a margin of error of +/- 4 inches, which means you may have a predicted height of 5’6”, but you could end up being 5’2” or 5’10”.
The simplified Gray Method involves adding together your parents’ heights (in inches or centimeters), dividing by two, and either adding (for a boy) or subtracting (for a girl) 4 in. (10 cm).
For small children, doubling a girl’s height at eighteen months or a boy’s at two years will offer a fairly accurate estimate.
More accurate calculation methods (made easier by online calculators), or hand x-rays that determine “bone age,” are also available, and of particular value for older children.

, Your final height is determined overwhelmingly by genetics (roughly 70%), with health, nutrition, and environmental factors deciding the remainder (about 30%).So, if you end up shorter or taller than you’d like, blame your genes. And don’t bother trying to hang on the monkey bars to grow taller!

, Any online search will result in thousands of hits for sites that offer “can’t miss” methods for increasing your height. The vast majority of them are junk. Special pills aren’t going to make you taller, but they might make you sick and they’ll definitely take your money.


Many of the sites describe exercises that will stretch out the body. While stretching is good, and may possibly make you a little bit taller for a short period, you aren’t going to see long-term gains from doing so. Remember, gravity always wins.
That said, exercises that improve your posture, so that you stand up straighter, can help you at least look taller.

, The human body produces its growth hormones during sleep, so the more deep, restful sleep you get, the better odds you have of maximizing your genetic height potential.For physical, mental, and emotional health, growing teens should strive for eight to ten hours of sleep nightly, ideally on a consistent schedule to keep they body's clock in proper balance., No, there aren’t any super-foods that are magically going to make you a starting center in the NBA, but proper nutrition can only help in the body’s growth process.


You know the drill for healthy eating: more fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, less saturated fats and refined sugars, more fresh food, less processed food.
Some particular nutrients, such as calcium, which strengthens bones (and thus helps improve posture), are beneficial to looking and feeling taller.Other essential nutrients like niacin, vitamin D, and zinc — all of which you will consume as part of a varied, healthy diet — may offer added benefits to the body's growth as well., Don’t focus on the exercise plans that claim they will make you taller. Instead, focus on a healthy exercise regimen that involves aerobic workouts and strength training; good health gives your body more opportunity to grow.


As noted above, stretching is good for the body, but stretching exercises that claim to make you permanently taller aren’t going to work for long. Keep your focus on health and fitness, and let growth come naturally (as far as your genetics allow).
Sixty minutes or more of activity per day can help keep teens feeling and looking good, which can help even if you don't grow any taller. You can locate recommended exercise regimens online."

, You can become baptized and be a ""born-again"" virgin, but that won't change the fact that you had sex at some point in your life., While drugs may be fun, they are also a very serious and dangerous thing to have in your life.

Do your best to not only be nice and friendly to everyone, but to build relationships with people outside of your comfort zone.Create a diverse circle of friends by reaching out to people regardless of their race, gender, what “clique” they fit into, or any other way that they might be different from you.

, Show kindness to everyone, whether or not you're friends with them. Even if you don't get along with someone or don't feel comfortable hanging out with them, show them respect and politeness. Don't be a bully or make fun of anyone.

, It can be tempting to gossip, especially with close friends or people you trust. It's best to avoid bad-mouthing though. Always assume that if you tell one person something, they’ll tell at least one other person. Before long, everyone will know what you said about so-and-so.


It's always best to be authentic, genuine, and sincere: in other words, don't be two-faced., Becoming a better person at school also involves your relationships with your family. Work on ways to build or improve your relationship with whoever is raising you. Talk to them about issues you face at school or with friends, and ask them for advice.Have clear and open conversations with them about how to be a better person.
Try asking, “What do you think makes a great person?” or “How do you think I can work on being less angry, or stay calmer when something dramatic happens?”

, In addition to your parents, teachers, coaches, and other trusted adults can be positive role models. You can look to them for a good example, and they can offer you advice about how to deal with specific situations. Consider favorite teachers, coaches, or club moderators.Ask them questions about decisions they made when they were your age, and ask them to help you respond to problems with schoolwork or friendships. Ask for advice about particular things and let a mentor relationship develop naturally.
Think about some really good people in your life who you look to as role models. What do you respect about them? What are their best qualities and values?

Learn from mistakes.,
Accept rejection and celebrate success.,
Brush off bullies (and don’t be a bully).",How to Be a Better Person at School3," Don’t complain if something bad happens: lots of negative stuff will happen to you in life that’s beyond your control. In ten or twenty years you’ll be wishing your biggest problem was a fight with your best friend, or a bad decision you made at school! Take the time to learn from everything you face: whether something bad just came out of nowhere or you made a decision that had bad consequences.It can help to talk to a friend, parent, or mentor to get an outside opinion. Ask, “How did this decision bring about these consequences? What would have been a better course of action?”
Don’t dwell if you messed up a friendship, failed a test, yelled at or said really hurtful things to someone, or anything else you might regret. There’s a difference between learning from a bad situation and obsessing over it. Learn from it, resolve the situation, then get over it and move on.

, Success and failure is part of being human. Whether you were accepted or rejected from a college or you asked someone to prom and they said no, you will face rejection in life. Handle both successes and failures with grace.Remember, whatever happens doesn’t control how you react. Only YOU control your reaction, so make the choice: do you want to let rejection or success control your behavior? Or do you want to be the one who decides how you feel?

, It’s a bit of a cliché, but people really do bully because they’re jealous or afraid. Bullies just want to pick on someone they think is vulnerable in order to look cool or cover up their own insecurities. Don’t retaliate or respond to bullies, and don’t be a bully yourself.If you really feel like you’re getting picked on to the point that you feel endangered, it’s okay to ask for help. Talk to a parent, teacher, or mentor: ask them for advice about how to handle it yourself, or to help mediate the situation.

Remember you are amazing, great and unique!",How to Be a Healthier and Happy Teen Girl," Of course,the odd treats are fine, but you just have to make sure that you eat more of the good (healthy) stuff more than the bad (junk) food. Make sure you're getting all the vitamins, magnesium and fiber. You need to be eating at least 5 fruits or vegetables a day. Think that would be complicated to do? It's not! Simply include 2 pieces in your lunch everyday, whip up a smoothie at home, make a fruit salad (at least 2 portions in every medium serving), and you can easily eat vegetables with your dinner.;
,, Water can improve your skin's condition, keep you from having less headaches, and can be a good refresher.

, Many people go off exercise, simply because they don't think they enjoy any sport or activity and are made to do it at school. But there is something for everyone, so experiment! Try your best in P.E. lessons and try to exercise 3 times a week, half an hour each time. Being fit and active has its advantages too, such as the chance to live longer, have a good, strong body, and avoid illnesses. Some fun sports are gym, swimming, jogging and football.

, It is essential for a healthy body and mind, and starving yourself of this special rest will leave you tired, worn out, unhappy and with tired looking eyes. Get at least 8 hours sleep a night, and relax 1 hour before, so it is easy to drift off afterwards. Have a hot drink, comfortable sheets and pajamas, a calming light on and relax. Have a shower or bath first too, if you like. Getting a good night's sleep means you'll feel more wide awake, able to concentrate better, and you won't accidentally sleep in on school days.

, If you are having a bath, pour in a small amount of bath foam/milk or bath sugar/crystals and swirl. Scrub gently with an all over exfoliator to get rid of dead skin cells and get in. Shampoo and condition your hair and rinse to leave it silky soft. Use a body wash to cleanse and wash your face then wash off. When you get out, towel off and slather on a rich body lotion, cream or butter to leave skin smooth and hydrated. Do this when having a simple shower so you can look forward to it every night! Pampering often refreshes, softens, smooths and can improve your skin. A lovely, relaxing thing to do.

, Clean your teeth twice a day for fresh breath, brush your hair for no knots, take off your make up at the end of the day and keep clean!

, Wear what YOU want to wear,not what the magazines are telling you too. Make sure that whatever you wear if 100% comfortable and makes you feel good. Skinny/wide-legged/boot-cut jeans, T shirts, hoodies, dresses, sweaters, trainers, pumps and Ugg boots are all great. Wear what you do with confidence and why not accessorize too? Add a cool bracelet or bangle, your face necklace or pendant or a pretty ring to add extra fun to outfits.

, Eye-catching or natural, the choice is yours and different looks suit different occasions. Good eyeshadow colours are light or dark brown,silver, metallic, greens, blues and light pinks. Lip glosses that are clear or light pink look nice,and balms look after the lips. Line the outer areas of your eyes with liner for bigger looking eyes and apply one coat of mascara for longer lashes, or just curl them.

, Get it trimmed every 8-9 weeks to keep ends from splitting and choose to have it short, medium or long. Wear it up for school in a ponytail, part tied up and part down or in plaits. Have a fringe if you want one and liven up your style with brightly colored hairbands,head bands or clips with pretty patterns. Look after it and don't overload it with too many products.

, It's not nerdy or geeky to want to do well in life or try your best,it means that you'll have a better chance of getting the job you want, expanding your knowledge and achieving. Do all your homework and have it in on time, be organized and have everything you need, listen carefully in class and try as best as you possibly can. You will be rewarded, plus being a hardworking student will earn respect from your teachers.

, Know who your true friends are and don't let the girls which upset you bother you all the time. Simply spend time with others mates instead and stick up for yourself. Arrange sleepovers and stuff to have fun with them. Be friends with anyone you want and think has the main qualities any mate should have.

, Walk tall with confidence and pride and don't slouch so much when sitting down. Also, a smile is nice to see!

, Reading, writing, listening to music, pampering, watching TV and films are fun activities. Listen to your fave artists and see if you can find some new songwriters too,if you feel like it. Know which things you're interested in and enjoy them!

, Use happy,positive words instead! If you have a boyfriend, love and appreciate him.

, It's good to be different and be yourself. Life is brilliant, and you can make it special.

Write down what perfection means to you.,
Make time to help others.,
Look at schooling as a chance to grow and learn, not a forced chore.,
Give yourself some ""me time"" each day.,
Enjoy the present moment, even when things are hard.,
Reframe negative thoughts and experiences as positives.,
Remember that life isn't perfect-- and that is a good thing.",How to Have a Perfect Life As a Teenager1," This includes goals, living arraignments, etc. Actual perfection, when nothing ever goes wrong and everything is amazing, is not possible. But you can get close by paying attention to your hopes and desires, striving to better yourself, and enjoying the present moment. When you envision your perfect day, what do you see? Who is there, what are you doing, and where are you?


Focus on things in your control, like your studies, career goals, and lifestyle.
Think of people whose lives you admire. What about their life appeals to you?
There is no ""right"" way to live a perfect life, so don't try and imitate anyone else. Instead, follow your own passions, dreams, and desires.;
, Volunteering, tutoring a friend, and helping your parents around the house aren't just nice things to do, they can improve your own well-being.Doing good makes you feel good and it builds a loving, supportive network of people around you that will help if your own life ever gets tough. Make your life about more than just you and the feeling of perfection will creep one step closer.

, Education is, and always will be, the easiest way to make something of your life. Through education you improve your job prospects, your ability to think and reason in any situation, and your general knowledge on a variety of subjects. School, however, often makes it difficult to truly enjoy learning, turning it instead into a stressful chore you must slog through. However, by re-framing school as a chance for a free education, enjoying the learning purely for leaning's sake, you can find new motivation to study and grow with or without a teacher.


The old adage, ""knowledge is power,"" could not be truer. It doesn't matter what you do in life, the ability to learn and hold knowledge will help you be successful and happy., You are busy, and it often feels like people need teenagers to do 8,000 things every 24 hours. But you need to put your own happiness first sometimes in order to do you very best work. Each day, take 15 minutes or more to yourself. You could read, listen to music, go for a walk, or simply lay in bed and count the stars on your ceiling. Distance yourself from other people, if only for a few moments, and relax. As you do, let your brain stray from all the stresses that hit you each day. Just enjoy the moment and think about yourself.This is one of the easiest, best ways to tune into yourself and your goals.
Try meditation for 15 minutes a day. It's been proven to aid mental, social, and physical health., Being a teenager is not easy. You are expected to excel in school, prepare for your future, join a few clubs, help with chores, and still ""be a kid"" and have some fun, all while undergoing profound mental and physical changes. But being a teenager can also be a blast-- you get to spend all day at school with friends, avoid most responsibility to pay bills or put food on the table, and get the chance to shape your life and future unlike any prior time in your life. So, especially when times are tough, take some time to enjoy the present moment. Take a deep breath and ground yourself in the here and now. You're young, and the whole world is in front of you. Even more importantly, you have the ability, right now, to make it perfect.


Remember, being a teenager doesn't mean you can't be a kid still. Have some fun, break a rule or two, and kick back and relax. Enjoy life!
As important as your teenage years are, they aren't everything. Everyone makes mistakes, loses sight of goals, and takes a few wrong turns in their teenage years. There is very little you can do now to ""ruin the rest of your life,"" no matter how bad things seem., No one can completely escape bad thoughts or events, and that is okay. Instead of wallowing in them, find ways to think of them as positives. For example, you may fail a test in chemistry, an event that doesn't seem to have any upside. However, this failure tells you something useful about your study habits, the skills you still need to work on, and potentially something about your enjoyment and engagement in chemistry. You can use this failure to make you a better student and person.


Avoid damaging or hurtful language in your own head. Don't say ""everyone hates me"" when you know that this isn't true of your friends and family. Don't say ""mom will kill me if I fail,"" when you know deep-down that she'll love you nonetheless., No life is ever perfect. There will always be mistakes, setbacks, misunderstandings, and plain bad luck. But these issues are all chances to improve yourself, and how you react to the bad times is far more important than the bad times themselves. Acknowledge that your life will never be perfect, but that you can get a little bit closer each time you overcome trouble or hardship.


When something bad happens, keep your cool and think ""how can I handle this?"" Avoid blaming yourself or others, lashing out, or wallowing in self-pity. Pick yourself up, find a solution, and think of ways to prevent a similar issue from occurring later in life."

Recognize and avoid destructive, unhealthy friendships and relationships.,
Find a healthy, positive role model.",How to Have a Healthy Lifestyle in High School," Many teens are tempted by friends or peers to start using drugs or alcohol at some point. While those who drink or do drugs may act like it makes you popular or tell you that everyone does it, this is simply not true. Not everyone drinks or does drugs, and you shouldn't feel pressured to just because some of your peers choose to experiment with intoxicants.

In fact, living a sober, healthy lifestyle can actually help you form bonds and develop supportive friendships with likeminded individuals.


Resist peer pressure and say you're not interested. If that doesn't work, tell your peers that your parents would kill you if you ever drank alcohol or tried drugs.
Tobacco use is also very dangerous and highly addictive. This expensive habit can ruin your health and make you very unpleasant to be around for nonsmokers.
Try to enjoy your life. If you find things to be happy and positive about, you'll be less likely to seek out escapes like intoxication.
Remember that no matter who you are, someone looks up to you as a role model. Drinking, smoking, or doing drugs sets a bad example for others.
Talk to a trustworthy adult, like a relative or a respected teacher, if you're worried you'll have trouble saying no to alcohol or drugs. There may be some underlying issues with self-esteem or your home life that can be addressed.;
, Distracted driving and unsafe driving are two of the biggest dangers to teens on the road today. Many adolescents don't think twice about texting while driving, talking on the phone, or engaging in other dangerous distractions; however, distracted driving can (and often is) fatal, and it can only take a split second of moving your eyes away from the road for an accident to occur.Never talk on the phone or text while driving. Pull over if you need to eat, drink, play with the stereo, or program a GPS, as all of these can be equally dangerous and distracting while driving.
Try to drive alone, at least until you're an experienced and defensive driver. Having even one other teen passenger in your car while you drive can double the risk of having an accident.
Take driver safety courses. If your school offers drivers education, you should take the class and pay close attention.
Always obey the speed limit. Remember that you may have to drive slower than the posted speed limit in poor visibility or bad weather.
Always wear your seatbelt when in a car, as a driver or passenger.
Never drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. If you're at a party and you or your designated driver have been drinking, call a taxi, a sober friend, or a parent to come pick you up.

, Not all teens and adolescents choose to have sex. In fact, many choose to remain abstinent. Abstinence is the only way to guarantee that you don't get pregnant or acquire a sexually transmitted infection/disease (STI/STD). There are many ways of exploring non-sexual emotional expressions with someone you care about, and having sex doesn't have to be the only way. Having sex can impact your romantic and social relationships in ways that aren't always healthy, including elevated stress levels and social isolation. If you do choose to have a sexual relationship, though, it's important that you do so carefully and responsibly.

Talk to your parents, a trusted friend or relative, or your doctor if you are having sex or thinking of having sex. They can help you decide on the best ways to be safe, and help you get the supplies you need. If you don't have someone you trust, check with a local Planned Parenthood or other local teen or health clinic.
Having multiple partners can greatly increase your risk of acquiring or spreading an STI. If you choose to have sex, you can help lower the risk of you or your partner acquiring an STI by remaining in a mutually-monogamous relationship.Condoms should be worn consistently and correctly from start to finish any time you have sex. Even if you use a secondary form of birth control, condoms should always be worn to prevent STIs.
Prescription birth control comes in many forms. It can help prevent pregnancy, but it will not protect against STIs, and therefore should still be used with a condom.
Emergency contraception, such as the ""morning after"" pill, is available if a condom breaks or if you forget to take your prescription birth control; however, these emergency contraceptives will not prevent STIs and should only be used in case of emergency (not as a primary method of birth control).

, Your teenage years can be incredibly difficult at times, due in part to the physical and chemical changes your body is going through. Some people may gain or lose a lot of weight during their teen years. Others may grow very tall while their friends remain shorter. Your body shape, size, or build should never be a source of embarrassment. Never feel bad about the way you look, and ignore anyone who tries to make you feel ashamed.

Remember that everyone's body is different. There is no standard or ""normal"" range of height, weight, or body shape, just as there is no ""normal"" hair or eye color.
Don't let others make you feel bad about your appearance, and make sure you never make someone else feel bad about his or her appearance.
If you want to eat healthier or increase your daily exercise levels, there are many ways to do so safely. Talk to your doctor about ways to stay fit and healthy without putting yourself at risk.

, Sleep is an important part of every adolescent's life. Getting proper sleep helps you grow strong, stay healthy, and feel your best. When you don't get enough sleep or when you get poor-quality sleep, other aspects of your life can suffer.Most teenagers need eight to 10 hours of sleep each night; however, some teens may need even more sleep, depending on their lifestyle and body chemistry.
Not getting enough sleep can affect your performance at school and your ability to drive a vehicle. It can also have ramifications on your physical health.
Set yourself up for a good night's sleep by maintaining a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. Going to bed at the same time and getting up at the same time every day can help program your body for better sleep.
Keep your room slightly cool — but not uncomfortably cold — to ensure a better night's sleep. (60 – 65°F or 15.5 – 18.3°C is considered ideal.)Try to make your room darker by closing the curtains or blinds. You should also discontinue all electronics use at least 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime to avoid upsetting your melatonin levels., It's not uncommon for friends in high school to share everything, and unfortunately that often includes germs. It's good to bond with your peers, but you should always practice responsible hygiene whether you're out with your friends or alone at home.Always wash your hands with soap and warm water. If you can't wash your hands, use hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes or mouth if you haven't washed your hands recently.
Cover your nose and mouth whenever you sneeze or cough.
Do not share food, water bottles, or cosmetic items with others, as this is a common way of passing illnesses and infections on to your friends.

, Fruit and vegetables are an important source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.Teens need fruit and vegetables to grow strong and stay healthy. They should be a part of any balanced diet.Generally speaking, adolescents need 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit every day.Adolescents should also be eating 2.5 to 3 cups of vegetables each day.Fresh fruit and veggies are a healthy snack and a superior choice over junk food.

, Water quenches your thirst more effectively than sweetened beverages. Because there's no sugar in water, it's also a calorie-free beverage. It's important to drink enough water everyday to ensure that you stay hydrated and healthy.


Regularly drinking soda has been linked to weight problems and obesity;however, other drinks include high levels of sugar as well, including juice, sports drinks, and many coffee drinks.
If tap water is too plain for your tastes, try an unsweetened sparkling water. Sugar-free flavored seltzer can be a refreshing and tasty alternative to soda.
Most adults need between two to three liters of water everyday to maintain normal, healthy bodily functions and stay hydrated.Carry water with you when you're on the go. You'll need to drink more water than usual if you're engaging in physical activity, live in a hot climate, or are otherwise prone to sweating.

, Foods which have been highly processed usually contain added salt, sugar, and fat.Cookies, chips, candy, cake, pastries, and microwave meals all fall into this category. Eliminate these foods from your diet if you can, eating as much fresh food as possible.

Limit deli meats. Try to eat no more than 70g of red and processed meat per day, or about two to three slices of lamb, beef, or pork.Be conscious of your sugar intake. Sugar is added to more products than you probably realize — including crackers, cereals, and jarred pasta sauce. Many low-fat products are actually packed with sugar. There is mounting evidence that sugar plays a large part in many serious health problems, from obesity to metabolic syndrome.Trans fat, found in fried foods and many processed baked goods, should be avoided. Instead, look for healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in foods like avocados, nuts, fish, olives, and seeds., Dairy is an important part of your diet. It helps you get calcium, vitamin D, and other vitamins and nutrients; however, drinking whole milk and eating whole-fat dairy products can be very fattening, and that may outweigh the health benefits you'd otherwise get from dairy products.


Instead of drinking whole milk, gradually switch to fat-free (skim) milk.
Lower yourself over several weeks down to 2%, 1%, and eventually skim milk so you don't upset your stomach by switching suddenly.
Choose low-fat or fat-free cheese, yogurt, and pudding instead of the whole-fat alternatives.
You can also try non-dairy milk and milk products, including soy milk and almond milk. These beverages and the food products made from them tend to be healthier and lower in fat.

, Even if the label on a food package suggests that the food is low in fat, sugar, or cholesterol, it may be a bit deceiving. Those labels are based on the recommended serving size, which may be significantly smaller than the actual serving size you're used to. Always check the recommended portion sizes on your favorite foods and beverages, and try to eat smaller, healthier portion sizes whenever you eat out.


Serving foods and drinks in smaller plates and glasses can make you feel fuller because it will look like there's more food in front of you.
Try serving food in the kitchen and eating at the table so that you can't just reach across the table for seconds or thirds.
When you eat out, try sharing the meal with a friend or relative. You can also set aside half of your meal as soon as it arrives and ask for a to-go box so that you won't be tempted to eat the whole thing in one sitting.
Resist the urge to add combo meals or ""supersize"" your meal at fast food restaurants. These offers usually include extra-large portions of french fries and soda, both of which are very unhealthy.

, Physical activity is important for growing bodies. You need to get exercise every day in order to maintain a healthy weight and build strong muscles and bones. Getting into the habit of exercising while you're in high school will also help set you up for a healthy, fitness-oriented lifestyle as an adult.Current guidelines for adolescents recommend at least 60 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity activity each day, with at least three days a week devoted to high-intensity physical activity.
Some good aerobic activities include running, bicycling, and dancing. You can use aerobic exercise to relieve stress at the end of the day, or to help you wake up when you start your morning.
Even going for long walks counts towards aerobic activity. Make walking a consistent part of your day, and try to walk or ride your bike instead of getting a ride for local errands (if at all possible).

, Building muscles is also an important part of living a healthy, active lifestyle. Lifting weights is a good way to build muscle mass, but you can also build strong muscles (especially in your legs) by engaging in aerobic exercise on a regular basis., Time spent in front of a screen generally reduces the time you might otherwise be spending on physical activity. Watching television for more than two hours a day increases the risk of an unhealthy diet, an inactive lifestyle, and weight problems or obesity. Spending too much time on the computer carries the same risks.

It's okay to use the computer or watch TV in moderation, but you should spend the majority of your free time reading, doing homework, visiting with family or friends, or playing outdoors.
You can reduce your TV/computer usage by setting a timer whenever you use either.
You should also keep the television and computer in a common room in your home so that you don't have constant access to them in your bedroom.

, Friendship is an important part of your adolescent years. Often times the friends you make in high school end up being life-long friends. It's very important that you choose your friends carefully and spend your time with people who care about you and have your best interests in mind.A good friend wants you to be happy and will support and encourage you, no matter what.
Real friends share your joys when you're happy and apologize when they've said or done something to hurt your feelings.
A true friend cares about what you think and feel, and will listen to what you have to say.
Friends will accept you for who you are and will not pressure you to do anything you're not comfortable with.

, Just as important as making good friends is recognizing unhealthy or abusive friendships and partnerships. These types of relationships can be very damaging to you mentally, emotionally, and physically. Learning how to recognize a bad friendship or relationship is only the first step, though. After that you'll need to reduce how much time you spend with that individual or cut him/her out of your life altogether.

If someone manipulates you or lies to you, that person is not being a good friend or romantic partner.
Jealousy, blame, and a generally negative attitude are all signs of a destructive relationship.
If anyone threatens you with violence, inflicts violence on you or others, or forces you to do things that you don't want to do (including sexual activities), that person is abusive and dangerous.
Talk to a parent or counselor about the friendship or relationship and sever all ties with that person immediately. If you ever feel like your safety is threatened, do not hesitate to call the police.

, Having a good role model is important during your teen years. You may not realize it, but you're at an impressionable age. While your friends and peers are important, they're still figuring things out as well. This is where having a mature, responsible role model can be of great importance.A role model should act as a mentor. He or she should listen to the teen, care about his or her wellbeing, offer guidance, and live a positive, healthy lifestyle.
Role models should exhibit healthy, model communication skills, manners, cooperation/teamwork abilities, trustworthiness, honesty, and sincerity. They should treat others well and be generally respectable and upstanding.
Not all role models are celebrities. In fact, many celebrities would make very bad role models.
Parents can be great role models, as well as teachers, aunts and uncles, counselors, older siblings, and even neighbors. Anyone who is responsible, trustworthy, and caring can be a good role model.

The best way to keep this feeling alive is to expose yourself to as much new material as possible. Teachers and school are great for this, but you should also follow your own passions. Where does your mind lead you? This is often the stuff that will make you happiest. It can also open the doors for your future, and show you potential careers or goals for life."

Sketch out your goals for adult life.,
Make a series of goals to help reach your dreams.,
Take the time to focus on your own dreams and goals.,
Talk to adults in your potential field or profession.,
Accept and embrace that your goals may change.",How to Have a Perfect Life As a Teenager3," What would you love to do for a living? Where would you like to live? What hobbies would you like to pursue? You don't need definitive answers for any of these questions, but this is a good way to get the ball rolling and help you find ways to prepare and train for adulthood. Brainstorm what you want life to look like when you're 20, 30, and 50. Note what things are important to you, and know that there are absolutely no wrong answers. You may want to be living easy in a beautiful location, or working hard in the bustling big city, it doesn't matter. Having an idea of your goals and dreams for the future helps you make the most of the present.


If you're having trouble, think about all of the things you don't want to do. This can reveal your real passions., Perfection only comes one small step at a time. You will not become the most popular kid at school, the best soccer player, or an award-winning filmmaker overnight, but you can start taking steps now to make these goals a reality. Start with your end goal, then work backward. What do you have to accomplish to get there? For example, if you wanted to be a professional soccer player:


Sign with a professional team or club.
Play high-level college soccer.
Get recruited to a college soccer team.
Succeed on a competitive youth team.
Train for your tryouts.
Improve you shooting, passing, opposite foot, and fitness.
Talk with current coaches and players about skills you still need to learn to become a pro in 10 years., Being a teenager is hard. You have a lot of people -- coaches, parents, teachers -- who all have different plans and ideas for your future. There is so much advice being shoved at you that it is hard to listen to the one person who knows you best: you. As much as possible, schedule time in your life to pursue your own passions, whether that includes finishing all of the Game of Thrones books or coding your own app.


Let people know your goals and ask them for their support. Oftentimes, adults don't realize what you want to do and compensate by telling you what they think you should be doing. Take pride in your plans and let people now so that they can help you.

, This is a great way to get an idea about what you need to do in order to make your dreams come true. It also helps you find out the realities of the job you hope to have, which may or may not influence how you feel about it. If you don't know anyone in your chosen field, fire off some emails to magazines or companies that do what you love and ask if they would be willing to answer any questions. Colleges and universities are other great places to get in touch with people with experience in your field. Some questions to ask include:


What is a typical day in your job like?
What do you like about work? What would you change?
If you could give yourself any advice when you were my age, what would it be?

, One of the biggest burdens on a teenager's mind is the worry that they have to plan their entire lives now or they will fail in the future. Nothing can be further from the truth. History is filled with stories of people who ended up in wildly different places than where they started, and you shouldn't stress yourself out planning a perfect future when chances are good your desires will change. Just work on being happy, expanding your mind, and sticking to your passions. The success will come, and the doors will open."

This is a great time to reach out and have a nice long conversation to catch up on all the lost time.Call them at a time that you think is convenient to their schedule. Avoid times when they may be too busy to talk, like when they are at work or school, or having dinner.
Acknowledge that it has been a long time since you spoke to get rid of any awkwardness and to let them know you are being genuine and not just acting like no time has passed at all.
It is best mention how long it's been right at the top of the conversation by saying something like, “It’s been such a long time,” or “I bet you’re surprised to hear from me.”

, So much evolution has occurred with our communication devices that it is rare people actually sit down and write a letter to someone else.

Don't change to please people.,

Smile.,
Don't take social networking sites seriously.,
Learn some basic things.,
Remember one thing, nobody is perfect.",How to Handle Teenage Life Pressure," You can enjoy it the way you want and nobody has the right to comment and judge you for what you are and what you do. Don't let people judge you and even if they do, just laugh it off. Remember one thing: People judge you because they are bored with their own lives and need something to make their life so called worth living. Ignore these kinds of people.;
, It will get you nowhere, but unhappy.

, Your studies is all that matters in the end. Nobody at Yale will care to ask you how many friends you had when you were in school or your skin texture. They will just ask you your marks and if you are dreaming of having a good college degree then focus on your studies rather than your popularity.

, Smiles change everything; hatred to loved, enmity to friendship, poison to antidote. So always smile. Remember one thing, not even a popular top class model can carry a smile the way you do because you are far more satisfied and happier than them.

, They are meant to be a diversion and a way of keeping in touch, not to take over your life.

, Learn to say no (no to alcohol, drugs or sex). Learn to admit mistakes. Learn to say sorry, learn to accept defeat, learn to stay on the ground when you triumph and learn to live life your own way.

, You are not the only one having all those weird pressures. Even the most popular students in your school have their own problems. Just because he is cooler than you, or she is hotter than you does not mean that they are happier than you. It's okay not to be perfect because technically nobody is perfect and therefore everybody is imperfect and everybody is equal.

Make exercise fun.,
Start small.,
Teach your teen the necessity of warming up and cooling down.,
Suggest trying team sports.,
Make it a family affair.,
Model healthy behavior.",How to Help Your Teen Stay in Shape1," Exercising should be a positive but goal-oriented experience. Suggesting that your child pick a goal, such as being able to run a 5K marathon, or learning how to roller skate, may be met with a better attitude than when you say that they should ‘get more exercise’.Remind teens that dancing and other simple movements do count as exercise.;
, If your teen has been largely inactive, it is important to help your child ease into exercising. Encourage your child to begin with short exercises that eventually will lead up to a longer exercise regimen.


Let your teen experiment with types of exercise, and lengths of exercise sessions, so that they can determine on their own what they can and can’t do just yet.

, If your teen has never played sports or done a lot of exercise, try to encourage your teen to warm up and cool down after working out.


Warming up will help to get your child’s body ready for physical activity, while cooling down will help to keep your child’s muscles limber so that they don’t get pulled or torn.

, When your teen is surrounded by other teens who all have the same goal, or are relying on your teen, your teen will most likely be more inclined to work hard. It will also give your teen an opportunity to socialize while also exercising.


Some team sports you might consider suggesting include soccer, lacrosse, football, tennis, softball, baseball, and swim team.

, Doing this will help to make your teen feel like they are not being singled out. A family bike ride could both encourage your child to exercise, while also serving as a family bonding experience.


You could also sign up for family events, like a relay, where you have to train as a group before the race.

, If your teen sees that you never exercise, or that you don’t live a healthy lifestyle, your teen may be less inclined to make the effort to exercise. If you are always moaning about exercise or complaining about all of the foods that you cannot eat thanks to your “lousy” diet, your teen is not going to want to join you.Instead, it is important that you use positive self-talk when talking about your body. It is important that you find an exercise program that you really enjoy and actually look forward to doing. Show your teen how much energy you have when you are done and explain the benefits of endorphins (they boost your feelings of happiness, and your energy levels).

Introduce your teen to cardiovascular exercises.,
Teach your teen how to practice strength exercises.,
Talk to your teen about flexibility exercises.",How to Help Your Teen Stay in Shape2," Cardio exercises burn lots of calories and can even help to control your teen’s stress levels. Cardio can also help to promote healthy lungs and a strong heart, which can lower your teen’s risk of heart disease in the future. Your teen should try to get at least a total of 60 minutes of cardio a day.Begin by introducing low impact exercises like walking, jogging, swimming or biking.
Bring your teen to the gym and show him or her how to use different cardio equipment, like treadmills, stationary bikes, or elliptical trainers.

, These exercises can help your teen to tone or build up muscle, and can improve your teen’s strength and endurance. Strength exercises include using free weights, resistance training machines, resistance bands, or medicine balls.Consider consulting a personal trainer, or even bringing your teen to see a personal trainer, to determine what strength exercises will work for your teen.
A strength training regimen may include push ups, squats, and lunges.
Always make sure that your teen knows how to use resistance training equipment; if your teen uses the equipment wrong, or tries to push him or herself to far, he or she could injure a muscle.
Your teen should avoid powerlifting, competitive weightlifting, and bodybuilding, as they exercises can damage your teen’s growing bones, muscles, tendons, and joints.

, Stretching can help to lower the risk of muscle injuries, such as muscle tears or strains, and tendinitis. Your teen should make a habit of stretching before and after working out. Encourage your teen to stretch regularly to maintain his or her flexibility.

Your teen can also work stretching into his or her exercise regimen by going to flexibility-specific classes like yoga classes.
Your teen should stretch for at least 20 seconds prior to any workout."

Provide healthy meals for your child.,
Limit the amount of time your child spends looking at a screen.,
Encourage your teen to drink lots of water.,
Encourage your teen to get plenty of rest.",How to Help Your Teen Stay in Shape3," Healthy bodies require good foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains. They do not need processed foods that are filled with chemicals, preservatives and artificial everything. Don’t refer to foods as “bad” though.


Don’t forbid food either, as your teen will be more likely to resent the fact that you have told them they cannot eat something. or they will become too much to ignore.

, Make your dinner table a ‘no screens’ time and stick with that rule for yourself as well. There is almost nothing in the world that cannot wait environment until your meal is over. Watching television while eating encourages mindless munching and prevents everyone from actually paying attention to their body's signals (namely the feeling of being full).Activities like games or texting may also speed up the rate at which your teen eats This can be problematic because it takes twenty minutes from the start of the meal until the body realizes that it has been fed and can stop. Getting absorbed in a television show can cause a teen to inhale their dinner so fast that they walk away convinced that they are still hungry.

, Have your teens watch videos about what sodas (even diet ones) do to the body because visual lessons are often more effective than just talking about it. Remind them that some colas are used to clean the gunk off of car batteries and to unclog drains and then ask if they are really interested in drinking this same thing.

, Don’t forget that sleep is important, especially to a teen body. Sleep deprivation or the chronic lack of good, restful sleep increases the risk of metabolic disorders including obesity and also impacts grades, behavior and social development as well. Teens generally need between nine and eleven hours of sleep each night.Help your teen to establish a better sleep/wake pattern by discussing their biological clock and avoiding waking them when they don’t need to be woken up early.

"
"
Be prepared for a little resentment.,
Bring up exercising directly.,
Try to introduce the topic of exercise neutrally if your teen reacted poorly the first time.,
Set up an appointment with your teen’s doctor.,
Don’t talk about “shape” or “weight” at all.",How to Help Your Teen Stay in Shape4," As a parent, you know that you are going to have to set some boundaries for your children and that they are often going to be angry about that. In addition to being angry at you for bringing it up, and suggesting they get some fresh air, your teen is likely to be angry at themselves for “letting” themselves gain.


Understand that some of these emotions are not actually directed at you, but rather at themselves.

, Try to be direct once and ask your teen if they would consider getting a bit of exercise every once in a while. If met with opposition or outright hostility, switch tactics. You can leave healthy eating guides out to be read or you can send an email to your teen outlining what you are willing to help with.


If your teen continues to be angry, back off. The worst thing you can do at this point is to continue pushing. Give your teen some space and let them come to you when they are ready.

, Try to be as neutral as possible when discussing the need for an improved diet and exercise. Make suggestions for fun, active activities and hope that the teen picks up the hint. After moving tip toeing around it for a few days, the topic might come up more organically and without so much animosity.


Being angry and defensive is natural and acceptable. Being rude or openly disrespectful is not. Remind your teen that self-expression is fine but that you will not tolerate behavior that crosses the line.

, It may be easier to accept that there is a problem or a potential problem when hearing the idea from a third party. To make this appointment more subtle, schedule it for back to school (especially if there is a required physical) or before a class trip. If your child signs up for sports or activities, he or she may be required to have a physical for that as well.

, Instead, talk to your teen about staying healthy. This might open the conversation up more than a talk about weight would.

Pick a special journal or notebook.,
Measure your height today.,
Measure again every month.,
Keep track of your weight.,
Record when you get new shoes.,
Write down your clothing sizes.,
Check your bra size.,
Try new things as you grow.",How to Keep Track of How You're Growing1," Have a special place to record information about your growth. It’ll be a fun project, and you’ll always know where to look to see how much progress you’ve made.;
, Have a parent or sibling help you measure yourself. Take off your shoes and stand with you back against the wall so you’re standing up straight. Use a tape measure to measure from your toes to the top of your head. Hair doesn’t count! Write down your height in your notebook in inches or centimeters.

, Pick a special day of the month – the 1st, the 15th, anything. Remeasure yourself the same way as the first time on that day and record your new height in your growth journal.


You might not see a big difference from one month to the next. Look back over several months to really see how much taller you’re growing.

, Use your family scale to weigh yourself, and write down what you weigh today. If you don’t have a scale at home you can find one at your school’s gym or nurse’s office, your doctor, or probably your local YMCA. Measure once a month and write down your weights as they change.


It’s really normal and healthy for both boys and girls to put on more weight as they get taller. Don’t be upset about your weight, but do make sure you’re at a healthy weight for your height. Your doctor can check this.

, Every time you buy a new pair of shoes, write down what size they are in your growth journal. Your feet will definitely grow big along with the rest of you.


Feet can grow fast! Make sure you check your size before buying shoes. You might have gone from a size 6 to a size 8!

, Whether it’s small to medium, size 4 to size 6, or going from shopping in the Junior’s section to the adult section, write down your new clothing size when you go shopping. Remember that sizes do vary between brands, but you can certainly watch for trends and focus on brands that you wear pretty consistently. Always try things on when you’re growing to make sure you don't buy the wrong sized clothes.

, Girls, you might notice that you need to start wearing a training bra, or that you can switch from a training bra to a bra with sizes like 32A. Picking the right bra can be challenging, so it’s okay to ask your mom or a sales lady at the store to help you measure and choose the correct size.

, Other than actually weighing and measuring, you can keep track of how you’re growing by trying to achieve new accomplishments as you get bigger and stronger. Try riding your bike without training wheels, reach for that highest kitchen cabinet you could never quite reach before without a stool, race your older sibling and see how much faster you've gotten. Keep a section in your notebook where you can record your accomplishments.


Older boys and girls who play sports or lift weights can set new athletics goals. Can you run a mile faster now than a year ago? Can you do more pull ups or lift more weights? It’s not always a direct relationship between growth and strength, but it’s usually a good indicator. Just be careful with weights and exercise if it's new to you.

Pay attention to growth spurts.,
Be ready for body changes with puberty.,
Prepare for your period, ladies.",How to Keep Track of How You're Growing2," Young adults go through puberty at slightly different times, but will all notice many changes in their bodies as they grow and develop. One big change is that you’ll have a “growth spurt,” or a time that you grow a lot in a short amount of time. Most girls have a growth spurt between ages 10 and 14. Most boys start growing faster between ages 12 and 15 and will keep growing until they’re about 16.Keep in mind that during growth spurts, you may experience an increase in hunger.

, When your hormones start to change during puberty you will notice changes in your body that mean you’re growing and developing. Seeing these changes can be strange at first, but know that it means you’re turning into a more mature teenager. Everyone goes through these changes.


Girls will start to grow breasts, get pubic and underarm hair, and will start to “fill out” or get a little more fat in places like their legs, tummy, and chest as they get older.Boys will start to grow pubic, underarm, and facial hair. They will also notice their penis and testicles getting bigger, their Adam’s apple getting bigger, and their voice getting deeper. It’s normal for your voice to break or crack while it’s getting deeper. This happens to a lot of boys., Most girls will get their period, or start menstruation, after their biggest growth spurt. The average age for girls to start menstruating is 12 1/2, but this can be different for everyone. Starting your period is a sign that your body is getting ready to be able to make babies, a big sign that you’re growing and maturing.Many schools will teach you and prepare you for your body to change with puberty, but some will not. It’s completely okay to ask your parent or doctor about these changes. You can say, ""I haven't gotten my period yet. Is that okay?"" or, ""I think I need a different size bra, mom, could we go shopping together?"" Let someone know you have questions and they will be happy to address any concerns you have.

Eat a healthy diet with three meals a day.,
Get enough vitamins and minerals.,
Get lots of exercise.,
Get 8 to 11 hours of sleep.,
Don't drink alcohol or use drugs.",How to Keep Track of How You're Growing3," Nutrition is very important while you're growing in order to reach your full potential for height, stay at a healthy weight, and have well-being overall. Eating well means eating a variety of foods so that you get as much protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and minerals as you need for healthy growth.Fresh fruits and vegetables and healthy protein like chicken, fish, beans, egg, and tofu are great foods to help you grow.


Teen athletes should eat a real meal between school and sports practice rather than lots of sugary, low-nutrient snacks. You will perform better, be stronger, and stay healthier with the nutrition from two dinners than from just snacking.Snacking throughout the day is normal when you're growing, but instead of potato chips and soda, snack on leftovers from last night's dinner, a smoothie, a sandwich on whole grain bread, hummus, eggs - foods high in protein and low in sugar.

, Iron, zinc and calcium are especially important for young men and women going through rapid growth phases, and dietary requirements for these increase when you're a teenager.Teens should get 1,200 milligrams a day of calcium, which is found mostly in dairy products. Low iron causes anemia which can make you feel tired and weak, and you need zinc to help you grow and develop sexually.Almost everyone should take a daily multivitamin in order to get all those other nutrients your body needs.


If you're vegetarian you need to replace the nutrients in your diet that you're not getting from meat. Zinc and iron, for instance, are both found in meat, fish and poultry; however, beans, seeds, nuts, and leafy vegetables are good alternatives for vegetarians.Vegans might need vitamin supplements to get the nutrients they require.
Getting enough iron is especially important for girls once you start to get your period, because the blood loss of menstruation can lower your body's iron supply. The recommended daily iron for girls ages 14 to 18 or who are menstruating increases to 15 mg/day.Because everyone has a different diet you should talk to your doctor about what you eat. They can help you determine if you need to change your diet, or take vitamin or mineral supplements.

, As your body grows and matures, doing enough physical activity will help you develop. Playing sports and being active will increase muscle strength, protect your joints from injury, and make your bones stronger.Being active now will also help you develop healthy exercise habits for when you're older.


Strength training can be especially good for kids and teens, like doing push-ups and using light free-weights, but ask an adult to help you learn proper technique to stay safe and prevent injury.Growing kids and teens should exercise for at least one hour every day, if possible.

, Kids ages 6 to 13 should ideally get between 9 and 11 hours of sleep every night, and teenagers need at least 8 to 10 hours.Getting enough sleep is necessary to function at your best - whether it's playing a sport or musical instrument, doing homework, or even getting along with friends and family. Make sure you get enough sleep by trying to have about the same sleep schedule every night, and making sleep a priority.

, Serious spurts of physical and mental growth happen in your adolescent and teenage years, and your brain is literally changing during this time. Drugs and alcohol can not only cause health problems and get you into trouble, they can inhibit your brain and body from growing properly at this important time.Drugs decrease your brain's ability to work well right now, and also prevent healthy growth and development for your adult years, affecting things like memory, perception and learning.Drinking alcohol can stunt your physical growth by delaying puberty, making your bones weaker, and even causing your arms, legs, and overall height to be shorter.You're more hard-wired to become addicted while your brain is growing so much, which can affect you for the rest of your life.

Obtain a pad.,
Pull your underwear down to your knees.,
Unwrap the pad and remove the backing.,
Center the pad in the crotch of your underwear.,
Pull your underwear up.",How to Deal With Getting Your First Period at School1," Perhaps you were prepared and have a pad stashed in your locker, but maybe this isn’t the case for you. Not to worry! Simply ask any girl in school who you think might have their period. No need to be embarrassed! Women sharing feminine hygiene products is a practice as old as time! It is part of the code of being a girl.Your bathrooms at school may have a coin-operated dispenser that sells pads.
You can also visit your school nurse. There will certainly be pads available there.;
, Sit down on the toilet so any blood will drip into the toilet bowl and not onto the floor or your clothing. Clean up your body using some toilet paper.

, Carefully open the packaging around your pad and remove it. You may want to save the wrapper for later. It is perfect for disposing of your pad when it’s time to change.Then, remove the backing to expose the adhesive. Usually, you will find a long piece of wax-like paper covering the sticky-side on the bottom of the pad. (In some brands, the outer wrapper may also double as backing, so the adhesive may already be exposed)., On most underwear, there is a cotton strip that you can use as a guide. Basically, you want the pad to cover the part that goes between your legs. If your pad has one wider or bigger side, it should go toward the back of your underwear (toward your butt). Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear.If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad is hugging your underwear — its ""arms"" wrapped around the crotch of the underwear.Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back. It should be centered.

, Make sure that your underwear and the pad fit snugly against your body. It might be a little uncomfortable at first (reminiscent of a diaper), but you will get used to it. You should change your pad every three to four hours (or sooner if you have a really heavy flow).

Create a make-shift pad.,
Go see the nurse.,
Wrap a sweater around your waist.,
Don’t be embarrassed.",How to Deal With Getting Your First Period at School2," If you are not able to locate a pad, don’t worry. You can use toilet paper to create a make-shift pad until you go home or can get to the nurse's office. Simply take a long piece of toilet paper and fold it into a rectangle. Place your toilet paper rectangle in the crotch of your underwear. Then take another long piece of toilet paper, and wrap it around both the rectangle and your underpants, holding the make-shift pad in place. You will want to check this more often that you would check a traditional pad, but it should do the trick!, If you have just gotten your first period, a visit to the school nurse might be a good idea. The nurse can provide you with pads if you need them, and you can probably lay down for a little while to feel better and gain your composure. The nurse may also have a hot water bottle or heating pad you can place on your belly (for cramps), or some over-the-counter pain medication (like ibuprofen)., Although first periods and usually very light, there is still a chance that you might get some blood on your pants. If this happens to you, simply wrap a long-sleeved shirt around your waist to cover it up. If you don’t have one, you may be able to borrow from a friend.The school nurse may also have extra clothes on hand for you to borrow.

, The most important thing is to keep a good attitude. It’s true that you might not feel very well when you have your period, and it can be a lot to handle, but it is a natural and important part of life! It means that you are a growing and changing. Having your period is something that should be celebrated, not something you should ever feel ashamed of.Remind yourself that almost every woman goes through this! Look around you: just about every adult woman you see has experienced what you are going through.
Try to have a sense of humor about it! Read about period jokes online and share them with your girlfriends. Such as, ""Jokes about menstrual cycles are not funny. Period.""

Learn about what to expect.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Buy supplies.,
Store supplies at school.,
Watch for signs that your period is coming.",How to Deal With Getting Your First Period at School3," The more educated you are on the subject, the easier it will be to stay calm when it happens. Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. You may notice your period as bright red drops in your underwear, but it could also be any shade from maroon to brown.Also, don't worry that you will be losing a lot of blood. The average woman loses only about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood during her period.


When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all.If you are scared of blood or bleeding, try framing it this way: your period isn’t blood from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy.

, One of the best ways to learn about what to expect is to talk to your mom, older sister, aunt, cousin, or friend who has already gotten their period. This way you can have an open, back and forth conversation, and ask any questions you may have. Furthermore, girls often begin their periods around the same age as their mother or sisters did. So if talking to your mom or sister is an option, find out when they started and what is was like.


You can simply say, ""I'm nervous about getting my first period."" (Or if you have already started, ""I just started my first period."")
Then you can say, ""What was it like when you started yours?""

, Your local drugstore or grocery store will probably have an entire aisle dedicated to feminine hygiene products. There are a lot of choices, and eventually you’ll figure which products you like best. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky or noticeable. You will probably want light or medium absorbency..


Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with. You will have enough to think about without worrying about how to properly insert a tampon.
However, if you would prefer to use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that is OK too. It is most important for you to feel comfortable.
If you feel embarrassed about buying pads or tampons, just remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to them.

, It is a good idea to store some pads in your backpack, purse, gym bag, and/or locker at school (just one or two in each place is fine). If you have the supplies with you at school, you do not need to worry about your first period catching you by surprise.You may want to get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies.
You may also want to hide a pair of underwear in your locker just in case.
You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker to help with cramps (just check your school's policy on this first).
You may also want to toss in a bar of chocolate, as it has been proven to help with PMS and give your mood a boost.

, There is no surefire way to know that your period is approaching, but there are some signs that might give you a clue. If you experience a stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, or sore breasts it may mean that your first period is approaching.Women can get their first periods as early as eight years old and as old as 16. The average age is 12.You may notice a white discharge in your underpants up to six months before getting your first period.Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds.

Your body is already fighting a battle against the cold and trying to get rid of it, which in turn, makes your body more tired.


If you can, try to stay home from school or work. If that isn't possible, lighten your load a bit. At lunch time, go to the nurse's office and see if you can rest in there until the end of lunch.;
, You have to avoid getting dehydrated, which will make it harder for your body to fight off the cold. Drink lots of water, orange juice, and tea. Avoid soda (even the sugar-free kind) and coffee, because the sugar and caffeine will tax your immune system and it will take longer for you to get well. It might pay you to remember tea also contains caffeine. Hot liquids especially can help alleviate your congestion and soothe your inflamed throat and nose. Try hot water with honey and lemon, or a nice soothing mint tea.
Avoid milk (and other dairy products) as these contribute to the production of mucus and will make girls feel worse.

, There are different kinds of gargles you can use to help your throat and your congestion. You can buy them at any drugstore, but it's super easy to make one right at home.Try 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt mixed with an 8-ounce glass of warm water.
Mix a little honey and apple cider vinegar in an 8-ounce glass of warm water.
Steep 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in 2 cups of hot water. Mix in 1 teaspoon of honey and allow to cool to room temperature before gargling.

, Sniffing your mucus back into your head instead of blowing it can make your cold worse, and can hurt your eardrums, giving you an earache on top of everything else. There is also a right way to blow your nose. Doing otherwise can, again, hurt your eardrum.


The correct way is to press one finger over a nostril and blow gently to clear the other nostril. Repeat on the other nostril, both nostrils are cleared. Remember to wash your hands after. This method is not just for girls, it's okay for others to blow their nose this way too.

, This is only for helping to ease your symptoms. There is no cold medication of any kind that will prevent or treat a cold. Also, cold medication can have unpleasant side effects and worsening of symptoms when you stop taking them. That said, they can help give you some relief, especially at night so you can sleep.Decongestants are used to reduce nasal congestion and usually come as a spray or to be taken by mouth. They only ease symptoms for a short period of time and are usually best to be used at night when you're trying to sleep (and many cause drowsiness, anyway). Do NOT use for longer than 7 days.
Painkillers like paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin can help reduce a fever and alleviate pain (like the pressure from your congested sinuses). You really shouldn't take them if you're under the age of 16 Do if you are a girl aged less than 16 don't take them. Make sure to check that it's okay to take the painkiller if you're already taking other cold medication.

, Since colds thrive in dry conditions, and dry air dries your throat and nasal passages causing a stuffy nose and scratchy throat, getting moisture in your body and home can help ease your cold symptoms.


You can run a hot steamy shower and sit in it with the bathroom door closed and breathe in the steam. Adding a little eucalyptus can help open your air passages for a while.
Stand over a steaming pot and drape a cloth or towel over your head to trap in the steam. Breathe deep.
You can also get a humidifier, just make sure that you clean it properly to avoid mold, fungi, and bacteria.

, These help alleviate the pressure caused by all the mucus in your sinuses and can help you feel better. Drugstores have reusable hot and cold packs available or you can heat a damp washcloth for 55 seconds in the microwave as a hot pack and use a packet of frozen peas as a cold pack.

, Various vapor rubs or menthol rubs like Olbas Oil, Vicks, or Mentholatum can help you breathe more comfortable if you apply a bit directly under your nostrils and they can help alleviate the redness and chapped areas on your nostrils.

, This is especially important to do at night, but elevating your head helps drain your nasal passageways of the mucus that's been collecting in them and will help you sleep more comfortably at night.


Put extra pillows on your bed, so that you're sleeping propped upright.

, Chicken soup can do a couple things to help girls get well more quickly. One, it acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and two, it speeds up the movement of mucus which eases nasal congestion and can help get rid of viruses. Also, it aids in keeping you hydrated., Healthy eating is a huge part of getting better more quickly and in staying better once you've gotten rid of your cold. This means avoiding sweets while you're sick: no soda, no candy, no ice cream, no dairy.Sugar is apparently terrible for your immune system. It curbs the immune system cells that attack viruses, which in turn keeps you from getting better quickly and staying better. Sugar can also irritate areas that are already inflamed (like your throat).
Try to eat more of the brightly colored fruits and veggies like berries, citrus fruits, kiwi, apples, red grapes, kale, onions, spinach, sweet potatoes, and carrots and garlic.

, Exercise helps boost your immune system which allows it to better fight infections and viruses. Girls who don't exercise are much more likely to get sick (or get a cold) than a those who do exercise. Exercise also releases feel-good chemicals and helps you sleep better, which in turn helps boost your immune system.


Even when you're feeling bad because you have a cold, try for at least a 30 minute walk, or some yoga. It will help you get better more quickly.

, Saltwater rinses and nasal sprays break down the mucus that is congesting your nasal passageways and removes virus particles and bacteria from your nose. You can get something like a Neti pot at a health food store, or simply use a bulb syringe.


Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt with 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda in 8-ounces of warm water. Lean your head over a sink and gently squirt the salt water solution into your nostril. Hold 1 nostril closed with your finger while you squirt salt water solution into the other and let drain. Repeat 2 to 3 times on both nostrils.

, Obviously sleep is important to getting over a cold, but try to do calm, quiet, non-taxing things when you're sick. This way your body is less stressed out and more able to deal with getting rid of your cold. Even if you're not taking a bunch of naps, lying down with a book or watching some television can help you feel better.

, Zinc is one of those things people are still debating over the effectiveness of, but recent studies don't seem to think that it does much for you when you have a cold. Zinc can also have the side-effects of a lingering bad taste and nausea.Do NOT use nasal cold remedies that contain zinc, as they have been linked to permanent loss of smell.

, Antibiotics attack bacteria and not cold viruses. They won't help you get better faster and over-use of antibiotics has led to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

, While for most people, there is nothing wrong with using Echinacea, there does not seem to be any particular benefit to it either. It seems to be unlikely to help make your cold go away sooner.If you have asthma, however, do not use this. Echinacea medications have been known to make asthma symptoms worse.

However, if your pain is pretty bad or if your wrist locks up, you'll need to see a doctor. If your sprain is bad enough that you can't write for school, you should definitely see a doctor to have it checked out.

Whatever pain you're feeling, you shouldn't make the decision yourself. Talk to your parents or another adult as soon as you notice you have an injury.
Be sure your parents get a doctor's note to give to your school.;
, If you and your parents decide to treat it at home, you'll need a splint. A splint is just a device that helps hold your wrist still, which your parents can find at a drug store or super store.

, ""RICE"" can help you remember what you need to do. ""RICE"" stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation.You need to rest your injury by not using that wrist or arm for at least a day or two.You can apply ice every hour or so for 10 to 20 minutes, especially the day you injure it. Make sure a towel goes between your skin and the ice. Otherwise, it can make your skin too cold. The ice helps with pain and swelling.Compression just means using a splint or bandage. You can take the splint or bandage off to apply ice, but when you're moving around it should be on.Elevation just means getting your wrist above your heart. You can prop it up on a pillow. Because gravity works on blood like everything else, putting your wrist above your heart makes it harder for blood to pool there. That means you'll have less swelling if you elevate it., If you're in some pain, your parents can give you something to help relieve it. Ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) are both good choices., If your pain is especially severe, you may need to stay home from school for a day or two. Your doctor can help you understand how long you may need.

In addition, if your pain is severe, your doctor may give your parents a prescription pain medication for you to help you deal with the pain. However, some of those pain medications can make you drowsy, which is another reason you may need to stay home for a day or two., If you had to miss a few days of school, your parents will need to write you a note saying why you were absent. They also need to explain anything you may need while at school, such as help with writing. It may be best if one of your parents can also talk with someone at the school. Your parents should include a doctor's note if you have one.

Any note your parents write should follow your school's policy.

, If you're still on over-the-counter pain medications when you go back to school, one of your parents will likely need to visit the school nurse. The school nurse will handle the medication for you, but your parents will need to give it to her. They will also likely need to sign a consent form.

Make sure your parent brings the medicine in its original container., You're going to need to rest that hand, at least for a day or two. If it's an especially bad sprain, you may need to rest it longer, even weeks. Of course, you will probably still need to do schoolwork, so you can try writing with your other hand. You can also see if a friend will make copies of his or her notes for you or share them with you later., It's important to let your teacher know what's going on. Tell her how long you think you won't be able to write with that hand and what you'll need instead. If you don't know what to do, your teacher can probably help you figure it out, as he or she has probably dealt with this problem before.

If you want, you can ask a parent to come along to help you talk to your teacher.

, If possible, do your schoolwork at home by typing or writing with the other hand. If not, maybe one of your parents can help you write while you still need the help.

, If you have a splint, you can decorate it. One option is to get a removable cover in a fun color or pattern. However, you can also have your friends sign it in a metallic permanent marker, so that shows up on your splint even if it's dark. Plus, your friends can draw fun things on it to make it more cheerful.

Just make sure they are careful, as splints aren't as tough as casts. You don't want them to hurt your wrist further., Tell your group of friends what happened. Most of them will be understanding. In fact, many of them may be willing to help you while you're recovering.

, Sometimes, people are mean and may turn on you for a silly reason. If it happens to you, whether because of your injury or another reason, it's okay to try to find new friends. Join clubs at school that interest you to meet new people, or try sitting with a different group of kids in the cafeteria., You will always find people who want to bring you down. If someone makes a snide comment about your splint or bandage, just ignore it. However, if someone continues to make fun of you, you should take steps to stop it by telling an adult.Tell an adult if someone is bullying you. If someone is making fun of you, threatening you, or even hurting you, you should tell an adult. You should do so at any time, but bullies make take advantage of a time when you're hurt to start bullying you."

It is something that a number of people struggle with their entire life. By starting good habits during your teenage years, you can help establish positive habits throughout life.Be proud of what you can do! Think about what you have accomplished in your life thus far. This could be anything - how strong you are, how smart you are, how far you’ve come.
Develop a routine to cope with low self esteem. If you start to recognize yourself feeling bad about yourself, do something you enjoy: listen to music, take a walk, or write a journal. This is not intended to distract you from your low self-esteem, but help you feel positive about the things you enjoy about life.
Focus on the good things. If you struggle with self-image, try making a list of things you enjoy. This will help you redirect your thoughts into a more positive light. For example, if you are worried about the physical state of your thighs, think about the strength you have in your body.If you feel down most of the time and can not seem to get yourself out of it, you may want to consider talking to your doctor. There may be a medical reason behind these feelings. ;
, Your teenage years are very busy between social and education obligations. You are also expected to prepare for your future. Start to recognize your limits now, so you do not stress yourself out and can help build a good foundation for your future.


Avoid alcohol, drugs, and gambling. You need to be in total control of your faculties in order to focus on your busy life. These activities can be habit forming, and can negatively affect your future. If you struggle with any of these addictions, talk to a trusted adult or your doctor.Be fiscally smart. The world is an expensive place. Learn to spend responsibly by setting a budget. Being responsible about your money can help you afford important purchases in the future and to help you for future emergencies., Your parents are there to help you with the tools you need to grow up into a healthy, happy adult. Talk to them with any problems or concerns that you have. It’s hard to ponder, but they were once teenagers as well! Write down your concerns. Sometimes it’s difficult to talk about subjects that might be difficult to voice or may be too embarrassing. You may be afraid to get in trouble. Try writing a letter with your concerns before you present them.
Practice what you want to say before you say it. Before you talk to your parents, try practicing what you want to say. Try things like: “Mom, Dad, I have something important to talk about. Do you have a few minutes?” or “Dad, I’m having trouble setting a budget. Can you show me how you do it?”

, Traits like sympathy, empathy, and kindness are great traits to cultivate and take with you into adulthood. Practice these good habits and stay positive. Say daily affirmations. Look in the mirror everyday and say something positive about yourself or your day. Something like: “I am strong. I will handle each problem as it comes. I will take care of myself today.”
Do something nice for someone. Offer to carry groceries for someone who looks like they need it. Help a classmate carry her books. You never know when someone needs a bit of kindness or is having a bad day!

, Making good decisions can be very difficult. It takes bravery and a solid will.Learning to make good decisions can be difficult, but is an essential skill to survive. Think about the “C’s to good decision making,” offered by the Advocates For Youth organization:


Challenge -- What challenge are you facing? What makes it a difficult decision to answer? Example: I am facing peer pressure from my friends and my boyfriend to have sex when I am not sure I am ready.
Choices you have -- Write down the choices that you can make. This will help you logically think through your options. What can you do? What can you control? What is out of your control? Example: I can have sex. I can not have sex.
Consequences of each choice -- What are the positive outcomes of your choices? What is the potential negative outcomes? Example: If I have sex, my friends and boyfriend would be happy but I will not be. If I don’t have sex, my friends may laugh at me and my boyfriend may breakup with me. But, I will be happy with myself and feel more confident about being able to stand up for myself.

, Know that you have rights as a teenager and that you can start to make important life decisions on your own. If you feel you are being abused at home or school, know there are resources out there to help you.


Sexual health -- Planned parenthood (US) , Family Planning Association (UK)Depression or mental health -- US Hotline, UK Hotline, AustraliaPhysical or emotional abuse -- Kids Health Organization (US) , Refuge Organization (UK), If you are lucky enough to have a healthy and happy home, there are plenty of things you can do to give to other teenagers or organizations in need.Pick an organization or cause that you believe in, and volunteer!


Advocate for teen health. Teenagers all around the world do not have access to health services. Join the fight to make sure everyone has adequate health coverage. Advocate for world peace. If you want to make the world a peaceful place for your generation and the next, join a group that advocates peace. , You are in control of your own body. No one else can make the decision to have sex other than you. You can decide when, where, and with whom to have sex. Learn to:


Talk to your doctor about safe sex. Doctors are professionally trained to help patients with all things medical. This includes how to engage in safe sex. They can talk to you about forms of birth control -- like oral contraceptives or condoms. They can talk to you about how to get tested for STDs and STIs.
Practice safe sex. If you feel you are ready to have sex with a partner, practice safe sex by using a contraceptive and knowing the risks. Using proper contraception practices will help reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Only engage in sex when you are ready.

Say no to sex if you do not feel you are ready. You should have control over your own decision.

, Your peers -- the people you see, work, learn with -- may feel pressured to make decisions that you may be ready to do. Try and avoid people who try and pressure you into making decisions you are not comfortable with. Hang out with people who encourage you to make positive decisions about your life.

, Having a good support network is important! You want to hang out with people who bring out the best in you and help you make good decisions.


Be yourself. You want to be around people who respect you.
Be a good listener. A friendship is a two-way street. You want to be there and listen to your friends for their triumphs and defeats.Try and meet people who embody the traits you want to have. If there is someone you know who goes out of her way to help others, try and strike up a conversation with her. Let her know that you respect her actions and want to learn from her.

, This includes learning to take good notes and learning to study them.


Take good notes. There are many great note-taking strategies to help you become a good student. One such strategy is the Cornell Note taking Method
To use this method, divide a standard 8 x 11 inch paper into three parts:
A 2 ½” cue column on the left-hand side of the paper. This will hold vocabulary words, key terms, and possible test questions.
A 6” note taking column to take up the rest of the vertical space of the paper. You will take your daily notes here. It is a good idea to write your notes out in an alphanumeric outline format.
A 2” horizontal row at the bottom of your paper to summarize the day’s notes.

, Your teachers can help you in a number of ways. It is good to be kind and respectful to them so that you can benefit from their mentorship.They can help you with college admissions, both filling out forms and writing letters of recommendation.

They can help you study more effectively.
They can help you find resources if you have struggles outside of the classroom.

, Life can get very busy! It is very easy to agree to take on projects, say yes to parties, or overfill our days. Time management is an important part of everyone’s life.Learn to say no, politely. It’s okay to say no to obligations if you have too many things to do. Try saying: “No thanks, I’m not going out tonight. I really need to study for tomorrow’s Chemistry test” or “I’d really love to work on this project, but I have a lot going on right now.”
Make a schedule and stick to it. Use a planner or a calendar and write down your obligations. Having this written down will give you visual cues to help you identify your obligations.
Be sure to take time for yourself. It’s really easy to take on too many projects. Remember to take a few hours a day just to relax or unwind.

Determine when it’s time to get a bra.,
Buy your first bra.,
Get a professional bra fitting.,
Try on as many bras as you can.,
Determine if the bra you’re trying on is a good fit.,
Buy the right sized sports bra.,
Dress for big breasts.",How to Deal With Getting Big Breasts1," Developing breasts during puberty should be an exciting time for you, but since so much is going on with your body, you might be a little scared, and that’s okay. Once your “buds” start to get larger, and possibly pointier, it’s probably time to get your first bra. But the good thing is, there are a lot of different types of bras to choose from. The most important thing about a bra - at any stage in your life - is that it fits properly and is comfortable.A bra is suppose to help give you support and help protect your breasts, they are also great at covering up your breasts and giving your upper body a nice shape that looks good under your clothes., Shopping for a bra - at any age - can be a combination of fun and frustration. Bras, like shoes, are made to standard sizes, but those sizes can differ between manufacturers. Therefore, like shopping for shoes, it may take a couple of tries before you find the bra that’s perfect for you., While it is possible to measure yourself for a bra at home, it may be a good idea to go to a lingerie or department store if this is your first bra, or if this is the first time you’ve had a proper bra fitting done. When you arrive at the store, tell the sales associate you want to be fitted for a bra. They’ll take you into the change room and measure you in two spots - around your torso, just below your breasts and around the thickest part of your breasts. The first measurement is the “band” measurement and the second is the “cup” measurement.The measurement taken around your torso or chest, just below your breasts, determines the number portion of a bra size (i.e. 32, 34, 36, etc.).
The measurement take over the top of your breasts determines the letter portion of a bra size (i.e. A, B, C, etc.), also known as cup size.

, Once you’ve been measured for a bra size, the sales person will start to bring you a selection of options to try on. For larger breasted women, the bra size determined during measurement is a starting point. You may need to alter these sizes for different types of bras in order to find the fit that’s perfect for you. In the end, it’s not the size that matters, it’s the fit. Sometimes when you try on a bra you know instantly if it’s good or bad. Other times you’ll try on a bra and just aren’t sure., Sometimes you may try on a bra and can’t decide if it’s a good fit or not. Fear not, there are a number of things you can consider to help you decide if this is the right bra for you.Do the cups of the bra fit smoothly over your breasts? If there are any gaps or wrinkles, the bra is likely too big. If your breasts are overflowing the cups, the bra is too small.
Does the centre panel of the bra lie flat against your chest. The portion of the bra that lies between your breasts should lie flat against the bone in that area. If it doesn’t, the bra is too big or too small.
Is the portion of the bra that goes under your arms and behind your back straight and parallel to the ground? The bra ‘band’ (the bottom line of a bra) should be straight. It should NOT curve upwards on your back. And the portions of your bra that are behind your back should rest below your shoulder blades.
Are the straps digging into your shoulders? Most of the support of your bra should come from the bra itself, not the straps. If the straps are digging into your shoulders, or if only the straps are holding up your breasts, the bra is the wrong size.
Do the underwires lay properly under your breasts? Underwires should not poke you, stick out on either end, or pinch your skin. The curves of the underwire should also match the shape of the bottom of your breasts.
Do the shape of your breasts look right? The middle of your breasts - when in a bra - should be half way between your elbows and shoulders. And they should point forward, not downwards or to the sides.
Does your bra feel comfortable in all positions? Can you walk, sit down and move your arms around and your bra still feels comfortable? Can you easily slide one finger under the band of your bra without it being too tight? If you answered yes to all these questions, you may have found the right bra for you!

, As of everyday bras weren’t hard enough to buy, there’s also sports bras to consider. If you’re in the market for a sports bra, there are several things you’ll want to consider. First off, no sports bra is going to keep your breasts from moving around as your play sports or exercise, but a good fitting sports bra will minimize that movement so it’s comfortable. A sports bra is fitted using the same measurements as any other bra - a band and cup size. If you already know your measurements, great, if not, have someone at the store take your measurements. Once you know your size, you have to determine which style you want.Compression vs. encapsulation. Compression bras literally compress your breast tissue against your body to help prevent significant movement. However, they normally only work for small chested women and for lower impact exercises. Encapsulation bras, on the other hand, have formed cups that can hold larger breasts in place better than compression bras.
Racerback vs. wide straps. Racerback straps pull together at the back, which helps provide more support (and prevents the straps from falling off your shoulders). Wide straps, however, distribute the weight of your breasts more evenly across your shoulders.
Pullover vs. back clasp. Pullover sports bras are sort of like tank tops, you have to pull them on over your head, or step into them with your feet and pull them up. Because the bra is made of only fabric, there’s no way to make any adjustments to the fit of the bra. Back clasp sports bra have clasps similar to an everyday bra, which is much better for bigger breasts, as it provides much more support.

, Dressing elegantly when you have big breasts can be difficult. When buying shirts you should look for ones with a longer shape. This longer shape helps to lengthen your upper body and make your waist look smaller - giving you a more even look and balance. Sleeves that are 3/4 length help as well, as they draw the eye naturally away from your larger breasts. Depending on the size of your breasts, you may also want to avoid wearing tops with only spaghetti straps. For the neckline, look for a V shape, or something that has a lower plunge. A lower neckline makes a larger chest look more flattering."

Know when and how to treat breast pain.",How to Deal With Getting Big Breasts2," Unfortunately there are a lot of odd myths out there about how breasts develop and whether you have any control over their size. In general, you have no control over when your breasts develop, or what size they’ll end up being. There are no exercises you can do to make your breasts turn out larger or smaller. Breasts are made most of fatty tissue and milk ducts, not muscle. Sleeping on your stomach will not impact your breasts in any way (although if they’re tender, this might be uncomfortable).There is also nothing that a bra can do to make your breasts larger or smaller, even if you wear it at night while you sleep (which is not needed)., Developing breasts isn’t something you’re able to hide, for too long. Chances are people other than yourself will eventually notice. You may feel stressed and unsure about these changes and what other people will think of you. These feelings are perfectly normal.Try not to compare yourself to girls you see on TV or the internet, there is no reason you have to look like anyone other than yourself. Don’t compare yourself to advertisements. The models in these ads are unrealistic, and most have been photoshopped. You don’t need to look like anyone other than yourself.
Remember that you are beautiful, no matter what. And yes, real beauty comes from the inside! If you need to, remind yourself of these things every day.
These feelings are normal, so don’t be upset that you feel them. However, even if you’re on an emotional rollercoaster, try not to allow it to affect your health. Eat properly, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly. If you’re unable to do one or more of these things, talk to your parents, teacher, school counsellor/nurse, or doctor as soon as you can.

, The age that you go through puberty is usually also an age when you’re becoming aware of how you look and how you fit in. When you body starts to change in all sorts of weird ways, it adds to your stress about what’s normal and what’s not. You parents may at times forget what it was like to be you age and experience all these changes and pressures. This is your chance to remind them, if they haven’t already figured it out. Tell them that what you’re going through isn’t funny and jokes should not be made. At school you may experience other students saying mean things about how you look, or making rude comments about the body parts that are changing. Keep in mind that most of the kids who make these types of comments are insecure themselves, and they’re making these comments out of jealousy and fear.Find a worthwhile role model. Maybe your role model is an older sister, or aunt, or favorite teacher. Someone who doesn’t follow the so-called stereotypes, but want to simply be themselves.

, Larger breasts can potentially lead to neck pain. However, it’s not a direct cause and effect situation. It’s not the physical size of your breasts that may cause neck pain, but rather the subconscious things you’re doing because of your breast size that are causing the problem. For example, if your embarrassed about your breasts, you might tend to slouch. And it’s the slouching and bad posture that can lead to neck pain. Sometimes the slouching posture isn’t due to lack of confidence, but to the actual weight of your breasts. If you have large, heavy breasts it can cause you to slump forwards, which in turn causes your neck and back muscles to become painful and can even put your spine out of alignment. Finally, the wrong bra can cause all sorts of problems. If you’re wearing a bra whose straps are digging into your shoulder, it might be causing you to crunch of your neck and shoulders together. This bad posture in turn leads to back and neck pain.Being happy with your breasts will likely make your present yourself with better posture because of your confidence.
Getting a better fitting bra could potentially solve some of these problems.
Getting large breast implants can actually create some of these problems. It is one of the many things you should consider before deciding to get large breasts via surgery.

, If your breasts have gotten bigger because you’ve gained weight, you may want to consider losing the weight again. Women who gained 30-40 pounds after the age of 18, but before menopause, were 40% more likely to develop breast cancer after menopause. The reason weight gain increases breast cancer risk is because of the increased estrogen hormones present in your body due to the excess fat. Weight gain is also normally related to lack of activity, and lack of activity can also increase your risk of breast cancer.The best way to eliminate this risk is to lose weight before menopause, or immediately after menopause has started.
To help reduce your breast cancer risk, and help you lose weight, consider doing moderate to vigorous exercise for 45-60 minutes 5 days a week.

, Larger breasts (or uneven breasts) can actually cause some women to experience mental health problems like low self-esteem or eating disorders. A woman’s self image of her breasts can have a huge effect on her self-confidence. Unfortunately there is no physical side effect associated with many of these breast issues, which is why surgery to correct many of these problems are not covered by insurance. But many surgeons have seen a remarkable mental health change in women who have had various breast problems fixed by surgery.If you’re experiencing issues with your breasts that are leading to mental health issues, but not physical issues, they are not less important, and you may wish to consider investigating what surgical options are available to you.

, Breast pain, also known as mastalgia, is actually quite common for all women, regardless of breast size. It can include tenderness, burning sensations, or tightness. It can be relatively mild, or it can be downright torturous. Thankfully most breast pain is not an indicator of any major problems like breast cancer.Most breast pain is caused by hormone levels, the structure and traumatic history of your breasts (e.g. previous breast surgery, etc.), certain medications (e.g. oral contraceptives, fertility treatments, hormone therapy, antidepressants, etc.), and breast size.If you’re experiencing any breast pain that you are concerned about, see your doctor. They can perform a breast exam and consider doing mammograms or ultrasounds to investigate further.Possibly treatments can include: topical anti-inflammatory medication, changes to hormone therapy levels, prescription medications, reduction of medications that are causing the problem, hot/cold compresses, reduced caffeine intake, low-fat diet, etc."

You can perform a set of 10 deep breaths for optimal relaxation. This can easily be done in class or in your office., There are some easily accessible pressure points you can use to reduce menstrual cramping. One is located 4 finger widths below your navel, and one is located on the front of each hipbone. Use your middle finger to apply slow, firm pressure at each point, holding each one for 2-3 minutes to start. You can do this discreetly over your clothes while sitting in a meeting or while you read in school.Don’t hold these points for longer than 10 minutes at a time, which may cause soreness. After performing one session of 2-3 minutes, you can do another if it feels comfortable.

, Massage can increase circulation and bring more blood to the area to relieve muscle cramping. Follow your discomfort to provide the most relief: If your lower back is hurting, rub small circles near your spine with your thumb, which is your most powerful finger. If you have lower abdominal cramping, use your thumbs to massage in a circular motion from hip bone to hip bone across your belly.Circular motions can penetrate more deeply and bring better circulation to the area than more sweeping motions. If a different massage pattern feels good though, just do whatever lessens your discomfort.
This massage is discreet and can be performed over your clothes in the car or when seated during your work or school day.

, Being well-hydrated eases muscle cramping and can reduce period pain. Aim to get 2 liters (or half a gallon) of water a day, especially when you’re having cramps. You can carry a water bottle with you on the go and refill over the course of your day., Essential oils can reduce tension and help naturally balance the hormones that cause bad menstrual cramping. Apply 2-3 drops of peppermint or clary sage oil to the inside of your wrist, so you can take a sniff during the day.

Do not apply more essential oil than directed. It is also not for use internally.

Take a moment to calm yourself. Try taking a few deep breaths and letting out your air slowly.Cry. It is totally okay to cry and sometimes it can be cathartic. Letting go of your emotions occasionally can be very helpful. If you find yourself crying constantly, however, or being consistently sad, talk to a parent or doctor.;
, When you are a teenager, you are facing new academic responsibilities, changing friends, potentially more extra-curricular activities. It can become overwhelming. If you are feeling stressed, take time to slow down and try one of these activities:Watch a funny show.
Swing at the playground.
Listen to your favorite music.
Take a bubble bath.
Play a musical instrument like the piano.Do karaoke on a streaming site like YouTube.

, It can be therapeutic to write about your feelings and emotions. Oftentimes, after writing about your problems, you can contextualize them better. Perhaps you see that a problem isn’t as bad as you initially thought. Writing can help you calm down and express your creativity at the same time., Some of your friends might be feeling the same way. Talk to them about how their emotions have shifted. Your parents or other trusted adults are also good resources. They too have lived through teenage years and can help you address your mood fluctuations. It is healthy for you to release your feelings., You and your friends undoubtedly influence each other. While you are undergoing hormonal changes, stick with supportive friends who will encourage you. Steer clear from friends involved in drugs, alcohol, or other illegal activities., As your hormones change during puberty, it is natural for you to be attracted to other boys or girls. This is healthy! Before engaging in sexual behavior, consider talking to a trusted friend, your partner, or a school counselor about the pros and cons of early sexual activity. If you do engage in sexual activity, be sure to use a condom to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reminds us that the only surefire way to prevent the contraction of STIs is to abstain from all forms of penetrative intercourse, e.g. vaginal, anal, or oral., Although your body might feel different as it is changing, it is important to keep on exercising. Learning to be coordinated with a new physical frame is important. When you do sports, your body creates extra beta-endorphins, which are hormones that can decrease stress and put you in a better mood.Understand that some sports might be harder for you than in the past. For example, if you were a star figure skater before entering puberty, you might find jumping is more difficult with increased weight. This happens to almost everyone! Talk with your coaches about how to adapt to your new physical frame.
Exercising can also help girls who have menstrual pain.If you are worried about working out on your period, see how to Exercise While on Your Period.

, As you grow taller, you will need some new clothes. Take this moment to think about your new style. Perhaps you would like to look more mature. For girls, this is a good time to learn about bras. Ask your mother, sibling, or a friend for help. Most larger department stores or women’s lingerie stores also have specialists who can help you determine what is the best type and size of bra to use. For boys who play sports, talk to your coaches about purchasing athletic cups.

, As your body grows, it is important that you nourish it with fruits, vegetables, protein, and whole grains. Try to avoid your intake of junk foods. You might be hungry all the time as your body is using energy to grow. It is okay to eat snacks but aim for things like trail mix or yogurt rather than candy bars or chips.


Do not skip breakfast. You will need your energy for school.
Aim for five daily portions of fruits and vegetables.
Include foods rich in iron and calcium, e.g. cheese, milk, spinach.
Drink when feeling thirsty. Dehydration can make you feel tired.If you plan to go to a party and know there will be junk food there, consider eating a healthy snack or even dinner beforehand.

, When you enter puberty, your brain starts to create sex hormones via a girls’ ovaries or boys’ testes.For girls, your body is producing extra estrogen and progesterone. Boys will receive more testosterone. Having extra hormones can cause changes to your body (like developing breasts for example) and also sometimes emotional changes. These are normal changes but can affect how you feel.Girls tend to start puberty around the age 8 to 13, whereas boys tend to start puberty a bit later from ages 9 to 14.Some children also enter puberty earlier or later than these ranges. If girls begin puberty before age 8 or boys before age 9, this is called “precocious puberty.” If you notice your body changing early, speak with your parents or doctor immediately.Puberty does stop. Puberty is necessary for you to transform into an adult but you must be patient. Puberty can take as short as 1.5 years to as long as 5 years to finish.It is hard to know in the beginning how long it will last but it will eventually end!

, During the beginning of puberty, changing hormones cause breast development. Your hips will widen and you will gain pubic hair. You also should become taller. Two years after the onset of puberty, you might start having underarm hair and white or clear discharge on your underwear. Your period is likely to start soon. Around your period, you might experience premenstrual or menstrual cramps. Your abdominal region might hurt and you could feel bloated.It is totally okay if your breasts grow at different paces. They also might be sensitive to the touch at this time.You could gain anywhere from 2 to 8 inches in height.Some parts of your body, like your head and hands, could grow faster than your arms and legs.You might feel physically awkward during this period. Do not worry! The rest of your body will catch up!
When your period starts, that means your uterus lining plus additional blood will leave your body once a month. Although menstrual cramps are normal, if the pain is unbearable, talk to your doctor., The sex organs will begin to develop. Your testes and penis will enlarge and you will gain pubic hair. Towards the middle of puberty, you will have a growth spurt. A few years after puberty has commenced, you will notice hair growth all over your body, including on your face. This will be a good time to learn how to shave and/or take care of your facial hair. Your body also will begin releasing testosterone. Erections and ejaculation commonly happen now. When you turn 14 or 15, puberty is almost to an end! Your larynx (e.g. Adam’s apple) will be more pronounced. Your voice might crack and sound lower and deeper.One of your testicles might grow faster than the other one. This is normal!Boys can gain anywhere from 4 to 12 inches of height. You can continue growing until they are 18 to 20 years old.Testosterone is the sex hormone that causes your testicles to make sperm.You might become erect seemingly without cause. If you ejaculate in your sleep, that is okay. This is a “wet dream.”As your voice changes, your pitch also could fluctuate wildly. This eventually will stop., Your brain will not be fully developed until you are about 23 to 25 years old. As your brain develops during puberty, it may be affected by risky behaviors, such as engaging in sex or trying drugs and alcohol. Be aware that any risky behaviors you engage in during puberty may lead to addictions later on., When you are a teenager, there are many things you might want to do. You might want to play a sport or be the star or the musical. Set goals as to what you would like to accomplish and give your energy proportionately to those activities. You must not be the star of every activity.Take the time to discover what you do best. Then, do your best at that activity!


Create a mini schedule for each week and day. Plan out your time wisely and do not try to load too much into one day.
There are some priorities that are necessary--like completing your schoolwork.
Staying fit and healthy should also be a top priority. That means sleeping enough and eating well.

, Although you might be busy with many activities, it is important to schedule some time to be with yourself. Try to grant yourself thirty minutes a day to do a favorite activity, whether reading the newspaper, playing the piano, or doing yoga. Aim to use this time to de-stress so that you can return to your activities with more energy.You could have a half hour or quiet time before school.
You could reserve a half hour of time to unplug from devices before sleeping.

, Moving forward in your teenage years, setting goals will help you feel in control even when your emotions might be making you feel the opposite. Aim for your goals to be ""SMART,"" which stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. This means that you should define your goals clearly and be able to see whether you achieve them or not.For example, a ""SMART"" goal might be do finish your level 5 piano book by January. If you are half-way through your book in September, this is an achievable goal. You can create a practice plan and divide your goal into mini steps. For example, you could aim to finish two pages per week. You will know you did it by whether you finish the book or not.

Acetaminophen dosage is 500-1000mg every 6 hours as needed.
If you’re at a hotel or restaurant for a business meeting, you can also ask the concierge or maître d’ for a painkiller. Many keep a stock of common OTC medications for staff members and are happy to share one with patrons.
If you find your cramps begin and you don’t have any medication with you, ask a friend if they have a capsule to spare.

, While tampons are very convenient, they can irritate the cervixes of some women, aggravating cramping.

Try a vinegar drink.,
Exercise more, and for longer periods.,
Be aware of stress.",How to Change Your Period Cycle Naturally2," Steer clear of hot peppers, ginger, garlic, chili, paprika and other spices that raise your body’s temperature. Eat bland foods for the weeks leading up to your period. Some women claim that this can help postpone your period because your body temperature isn’t being elevated by the food, but there is no medical research to back this up., A traditional home remedy, it’s not clear why it might work — but many women say that it does. You should eat it on an empty stomach, at least once a day for a week prior to when your cycle would normally begin., Boil a bunch of parsley in 16 oz of water for 20 minutes. Strain the liquid and add honey. Consume it two to three times per day, 15 days before your period is set to begin.

, Add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to an 8-oz glass of water. Start drinking three times a day at least three days before your period is set to begin. Again, remember that none of these remedies are backed up with scientific evidence., When you are habitually exercising, your levels of progesterone, a hormone known to inhibit menstrual bleeding, are elevated. Do strenuous activities like running, swimming, weight-lifting, or aerobics. If you are already engaged in some form of exercise, increase the intensity. If you are physically inactive, try a progressive exercise program to safely ease yourself into an exercise routine., This is not a suggestion to seek out more stress in your life — it is an observation that often one traumatic event will postpone or even prevent a normal menstrual cycle. Mental and emotional stress tend to put our bodies on alert, and your body will deal with the stress rather than creating your normal menstrual period."

Use light.,
Spend more time with women who are menstruating.,
Talk to your doctor about bioidentical hormones.,
De-stress to maintain a positive hormonal balance.",How to Change Your Period Cycle Naturally3," Try sleeping in total darkness for all but three nights of your cycle. During those three nights, have a light on in the adjoining room to mimic moonlight. According to some, these three nights of light then trigger ovulation, allowing your body to get onto a regular menstrual cycle. Some women have found this to be very effective, but there is no research other than personal stories to support it., It is theorized that the pheromones their bodies release can affect your cycle and trigger your body to menstruate earlier or later. Groups of women living together for months at a time may overlap on their cycles if their cycles last for a similar number of days.Scientific studies have partially debunked this claim, but many women still swear by it., These are hormones that are made to be molecularly identical to the hormones made in a woman's body, though they are instead synthesized from soy and yams.They are often taken to treat menopausal symptoms, but may also help with things like PMS, fibroids, and regulating your period. Talk to your doctor about options for FDA-approved bioidentical drugs and the potential side effects.

Be aware that over-the-counter plant-derived progesterone creams and yam extract creams do not work the same, as they either have too little of the hormone to be effective or cannot be synthesized by the body and converted into progesterone.
Products that are not FDA-approved are not regulated, meaning there is no way to verify that they actually contain what they claim on the bottle.
More research still needs to be done on bioidentical drugs and the long-term risks.

, Stress disrupts the hormonal activity that initiates and sustains your menstrual cycle. Identify the source of the stress and from there you can reduce stress.

Walk away from the situation.,
Ask the person bothering you to stop.,
Try to avoid being alone.,
Avoid violent reactions.,
Be prepared to defuse the situation confidently.,
Report the person that is bothering you.",How to Deal With Boys Who Are Obsessed With Your Boobs1," If a boy is bothering you, calling you names, or trying to touch you, probably the best thing you can do is to walk away from the situation, which may be more difficult to do than fighting back. He will thrive on getting a reaction out of you, and if you don’t give it to him, he will eventually get bored and hopefully leave you alone.If you are feeling upset by something he did or said, consider visiting your guidance counselor to discuss what happened. Not only will this give you someone you can trust to talk about it, they may also talk to the boy directly, informing him of the consequences of such behavior.;
, It may be that the boy who is being inappropriate thinks he is giving you a compliment, or that he is just trying to be funny. He may not realize that what he is saying/doing is inappropriate, and that it truly does bother you. Therefore, you should approach him, and politely ask him to stop.Try to approach him when he is by himself, if he is with a group of friends, he is more likely to respond defensively. If you think he doesn’t realize his behavior is wrong, you can try starting out with a friendly, but firm tone of voice. Don’t walk up to him and start yelling accusations, as it will make him less likely to listen, and more likely to become defensive.
State clearly what he has said/done that has bothered you. For example, if he constantly points out that you have big boobs, you can say something like, “When you talk about my boobs, it makes me feel very uncomfortable, and you don't have the right to talk to me like that.” Hopefully, at this point, he will realize you mean business, and promise to stop (don’t worry if he looks or acts annoyed, he is probably just embarrassed). However, if he says he’ll do whatever he wants, and continues like that, tell him you will report him to the principal (or to your boss) for sexually harassing you if he says anything else.

, If a boy has been bothering you, and you are worried that he might try to touch you or bother you, try to avoid being alone.For example, if you walk home from school try to walk with other friends. When you see the boy who has been bothering you, try to join in the conversation of people around you so that he will see you are with friends.

, It may be tempting to slap, kick, hit or punch a boy who is saying hurtful things to you, but it will show him that he can easily provoke you. If he is a violent person himself, he might even hurt you physically. Therefore, resist the urge to show him what you think physically., As a woman, it is very likely that someone, at some point will make a comment that is inappropriate or will stare in a way that is inappropriate. Accept this fact, and have a few ideas about how you will react.For example, if your co-worker or classmate says something inappropriate to you, you can respond by firmly, but politely saying, “I feel that what you said is inappropriate, and I would appreciate it if, in the future, you would avoid such comments.”
If you catch someone staring at your breasts while you are talking to them, simply stop talking until they realize you have stopped, and look at your face to see why, then begin talking again as if nothing happened. More than likely, they’ll get the hint.

, If you feel afraid for your safety, or the person has ignored your polite requests to stop, don’t be afraid to tell human resources, a trusted teacher, or guidance counselor about what is going on.If the person you tell doesn’t seem to take you seriously, don’t be afraid to tell someone else. For example, if you have told a teacher, and the teacher responds by telling you to relax and take a joke, then go to your guidance counselor, vice principal, or principal. If you are at work, start by telling your immediate supervisor, and keep moving up the chain of command until someone takes you seriously. If it seems that no one in your work or school will take you seriously, you may need to go to the police.
If you have to tell more than one person because you aren’t being taken seriously, be sure to report the authoritative person who didn’t take you seriously in the first place. If they think sexual harassment is a laughing matter, then they also need to be taught about why it is a very serious issue.
If you are a child or a teen, make sure to tell your parents what is going on.
It is true that reporting a person to human resources or a teacher might cause awkwardness in the office or classroom, especially if it somehow gets out. However, it is better that the person bothering you truly understands what he has done, and that you can go to work or school each day without fearing what will be said to you.

Learn everything you can about your period.,
Carry an emergency period kit.,
Choose the right pad, tampon, or menstrual cup.,
Experiment with different methods for dealing with pain.",How to Cope With Puberty As a Girl1," One of the biggest changes you’ll face during puberty is the start of your period. It can seem very overwhelming and uncomfortable to talk about, but the more you know about it, the more prepared you’ll be.


Check the library for books on the topic, ask your school nurse if she can give you any information, or talk to your doctor about what to expect or to address any questions you have.
In addition, talk to you mother, an older sibling, or family member about what their experiences were when they first got their period.;
, You’ll probably feel better about getting your period if you’re ready for it. It can be nerve racking worrying about where you’ll be and what you’ll be doing when it comes. Make an emergency period kit you can carry with you so you’ll be prepared when you get your first period or for any unexpected bleeding.


Include sanitary pads, tampons, menstrual cups, a clean pair of underwear, and pain reliever., Finding the right method to absorb the blood during your period takes some time and experimentation. Pads and tampons come in a variety of absorbencies. The absorbency you need will depend how heavy your flow is, which can vary throughout the several days you are on your period. Consider the following when you’re deciding which method to try first:


Pads are the easiest method to use when you first get your period. These are rectangular pieces of absorbent material that attach to the inside of your underwear with a strip of adhesive. If your period is heavy, you will probably want a thick, super absorbent pad with wings (pieces of cloth that fold over the sides of your underwear to prevent leaking). On lighter days you may be able to wear a thin panty liner. You should change your pad every three to four hours.
Tampons are a little more difficult to use than pads. Tampons are made of absorbent material that is compressed into a tubular shape that is inserted into the vagina to absorb the blood. Many tampons come in a plastic applicator, which can make inserting them easier. They also come in different absorbencies, like super, regular, or light. To use a tampon, relax your body and follow the directions on the box. You will remove it by pulling gently on the string that hangs outside your body. You should change your tampon every four to six hours.
A menstrual cup is a small rubber or silicone cup you insert into your vagina to catch the blood before it leaves your body. You should remove and empty the cup several times a day. To do so, follow the instructions on the package., Every girl’s period is different so what works to relieve period cramps for your friend might not work as well for you. Talk to your mom and other adult females about what tips and tricks they have for relieving period pain and experiment with these until you find one that works for you.


Some women use heating pads or hot water bottles to ease pain.
Pain relievers with ibuprofen might also help. If you’re experiencing a great deal of pain, you can also talk to your doctor about a prescription pain reliever that might give you more relief."

Understand menstruation.,
Learn when to expect your first period.,
Prepare for physical and emotional symptoms.,
Learn roughly how long periods last.,
Make a period kit.,
Consider tampons.,
Get comfortable asking other girls for supplies.,
Prepare to talk to your parents about your period.,
Keep spare pants and underwear at school.,
Have dark clothing ready for your first period.,
Understand irregular periods are common when you first begin menstruating.",How to Be Ready for Your First Period," Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the bodily processes behind menstruation. Many women feel more comfortable with their first period if they understand why menstruation occurs.


Your menstrual cycle is a bodily process that begins in puberty, when you reach sexual maturity. Each month, your body prepares you for possible pregnancy. The walls of your uterus thicken with extra blood and tissue and your ovaries release an egg.The egg will move down one of your two fallopian tubes into the uterus. If fertilized, the egg will remain in the uterus and grow into a fetus. If this does not occur, the lining of the uterus breaks down and bleeding occurs. This is what is referred to as your monthly period.;
, Not all women begin menstruation around the same time. While the average age is 12, some girls start as late as 16 and others as early as 8. There are some ways you can get a sense of when you may expect your period.Other signs of puberty may give you a sense of when to expect your first period. Most girls have their period about 2 to 2 and a half years after they start to develop breasts.If you're getting close to having your period, you may notice a thin, white discharge coming from your vagina. This usually happens around 6 months before your first period.If you have an eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa, your period may be delayed due to hormonal changes that occur in the body under physical stress.

, Periods are not usually painful. However, some women do experience physical symptoms before and during their period. You may have some emotional side effects, such as mood swings, as well.


Just before and during your period, you may experience cramping in the lower abdomen as well as breast tenderness. Due to hormonal changes, some women may also experience changes in mood. You may be more irritable during your period or you may experience mild sadness. You might notice you cry easier before and during your period.Over the counter painkillers like ibuprofen can be used to treat cramping and physical symptoms. Exercising regularly, even during your period, can help regulate your mood., When you first start getting your period, it may only last a few days. Bleeding may be inconsistent or very light. On average, periods last between 2 and 7 days., A great way to prepare for your period is to make a period kit. This is a kit that contains all necessary supplies for your period. In the event you start your period, you'll have your kit ready to go.


In a small, discreet bag place feminine products. Most girls prefer to use pads when first starting to menstruate. You can purchase pads at a local supermarket or drug store. If you're not comfortable buying pads alone, have an older female relative take you shopping. She can give you recommendations. You may need heavier pads when first starting your period.
You should also keep some over-the-counter painkillers in your kit. This will be helpful in the event of cramping.
A clean pair of underwear can also be helpful. If you have your period unexpectedly, you might need a change of underwear.
It might be a good idea to have two period kits: one that you keep at school and one that you keep at home.

, Many girls are nervous to use tampons when first starting their period. It's okay if you want to use pads at first. However, be aware that tampons are perfectly safe when used properly.


If you are very active, it might make sense to use tampons. Tampons are easier to use for exercise and sports.Understand a tampon cannot get lost inside of you. It is physically impossible for your tampon to go into your uterus. In the event a string breaks off a tampon, it's fairly easy to fish the tampon out.Tampons must be changed every 4 hours, however. This is to prevent infection., On occasion, you may have to ask another girl in your class for supplies. Keep in mind all women have been in this predicament. You should not be embarrassed to reach out to female classmates. Be aware of which of your female friends have already had your period. This way, you'll know who to ask., When you get your first period, you'll likely want to tell your parents. This is so they can help you purchase supplies and answer any questions you might have. Talking to your parents about menstruation can be awkward but you can avoid embarrassment by choosing a method that feels safe for you.


Families have different ways of handling things like puberty and menstruation. Some families are very open and may even celebrate a first period. Other families may prefer to talk about such things privately. Keep your family's personality in mind when deciding how to disclose your period to an adult.You can talk to a parent by simply pulling your mom and dad aside and being straightforward. Try saying something like, ""I just got my period. Can you help me get some supplies?"" Your parents, depending on their personalities, may feel a little uncomfortable talking to you about menstruation. However, keep in mind they would rather you ask any questions you may have then have you remain confused.If you have siblings, they may tease you a bit about your period. However, try to ignore the teasing. You can counter by saying your period is simply a sign that you're maturing., If your period happens at school, you'll want to be prepared. Keep spare underwear and pants at school. You can keep them in your locker or backpack. Change between classes in the event of an emergency. You can also conceal leaks by wrapping a sweatshirt around your waist., Make sure you have at least some dark clothing, especially dark pants or skirts. While pads and tampons will usually prevent leaks, in the event you have a leak darker clothing conceals it better., Many girls are surprised and alarmed by their first periods as they may be irregular. However, menstrual irregularities are very common when you're first having your period.


It's common for your miss a period here and there. You may not have your period for a few months in a row. It can take up to 2 years for your menstrual cycle to become regular.When you first start your period, your periods may be very light or very heavy. You may also start bleeding, stop, and then start again."

Ignore unwanted stares or comments.,
Ask them to leave you alone.,
Keep your body language strong.,
Point out something that can help others identify him.",How to Deal With Boys Who Are Obsessed With Your Boobs2," If you are in public, and you catch someone staring at your breasts, or if someone is making inappropriate comments about your breasts, it is probably best just to ignore it. More than likely, they are trying to see if they can get a reaction out of you, and the best way to get them to leave you alone is to show that you won’t react to it.This is especially true if you feel that the person may physically assault you. In this case, the goal should be to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Make your way to a very public space where there are lots of people around. If the person is threatening you, call the authorities immediately to tell them what is going on.

, If someone is making comments to you, and won’t let off even though you’ve ignored them, politely (but firmly) ask them to please leave you alone. It may be tempting to use strong language, but try to remain polite. If it is a stranger, it will be difficult to predict how they might react to provocation, particularly if they are the kind of person who thinks it’s ok to make inappropriate comments to women in the first place.For example, you can simply say, “Don’t talk about my body that way. That’s harassment.” If they persist, take your phone out of your bag or pocket, and tell them that you will call the police if they continue. Don’t be meek, be firm and confident.

, If someone is threatening, for most of us, the natural reaction will be to shy away from them. Face the person directly, stand up straight, maintain eye contact, and tell them to leave you alone., If someone is harassing you, make sure that you quickly pick out something unique about them that will help friends or strangers around you to quickly pick him out of the crowd. You will want to use this identifier in your sentence when you tell him to leave you alone.For example, if a boy wearing a bright green shirt says, “Hey! You have a nice rack!” Look him in the eye, and loudly say, “You in the green shirt! Stop talking about my body! That’s harassment!” If you say it loudly enough, it will draw the attention of others around you, and he will almost definitely leave you alone.
If you are alone, and no one is around, pointing something out about that person that is unique may still help you to identify him later, if necessary, and it will show him that you’ve had a good look at him, so he isn’t completely anonymous.

"
"
Discuss their behavior with them.,
Be direct.,
Change the conversation.,
Consider removing him from your life.",How to Deal With Boys Who Are Obsessed With Your Boobs3," If the person making you uncomfortable about your breasts is someone such as a boyfriend, husband, or friend, you should absolutely discuss the issue with them. Explain to them that you know they probably don’t mean anything by it, but that their comments and actions make you feel uncomfortable and disrespected, and that you would really appreciate it if they would stop.


Be firm and confident during this discussion. You need him to understand that you are really serious about what you are saying., You need to make them understand exactly why it bothers you, and why it is inappropriate. Explain to him each reason why it bothers you, and that in this day and age, you don’t feel that you should be objectified by the boys in your life.


Don’t expect him to read your mind. If you never say anything, he simply may not realize that what he is saying is bothering you.
You can also point out that no woman deserves to be treated like an object. Many males have seen other women in their life harassed by fathers, grandfathers, brothers, or friends, so it is important to try to put an end to the cycle., If he tries to bring up your breasts in conversation, try to quickly change the topic of conversation to something non-sexual. For example, you could talk about a new restaurant you have tried, or how great the weather has been lately.


Over time, it may also help him understand that you will not tolerate or encourage these remarks in any way.
Understand, though, that it is important to address the behavior. People should not be allowed to get away with treating women (or boys for that matter) like objects.

, If, after one or more direct discussion(s) about the matter, the man in your life continues to make remarks that disrespect you, it’s time to think of removing him from your life. In the future, you might want to consider including boys in your life who respect you enough to honor your wishes, and who respect you enough to not make inappropriate remarks about your body.


This may mean breaking up with him if he is your boyfriend, or ceasing contact if it is just a friend. If it is your husband or partner, and you don’t want to give up on the relationship, consider suggesting couple’s counselling. Having someone to help guide you and your husband through the reasons why you don’t want your body to be objectified may make it more clear for him.

Get a bra when you need one.,
Eat healthy, but don’t diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Talk to a parent about how to handle hair growth.,
Wash your face regularly.,
Wear a panty liner.,
Learn to handle other people’s reactions to your changing body.,
Remind yourself it’s just a phase.",How to Cope With Puberty As a Girl2," One of the things girls deal with during puberty is developing breasts. Usually, girls start developing breasts when they are 10 or 11 years old. Once this happens, you may need to wear a bra to feel comfortable. Ask your mom or an older sister to help you find a bra that is the right fit for your body.It’s tough to know when you’re ready for a bra, but if you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, it is a good indication you’re ready to get one: Do you feel uncomfortable changing in the locker room? Do you feel uncomfortable wearing a light t-shirt because your breasts feel exposed? Are most of your friends wearing bras? Are you developing faster than most of your friends?Asking your mom for help picking out a bra can be embarrassing. Remember, she went through the same thing at one time in her life and will be happy to help you. If you’re not sure how to bring it up, try saying something like this: “I’ve been feeling a little uncomfortable about my body lately. I think it might be time for me to wear a bra. Can you help me pick one out?”

, Another change you’ll face during puberty is that your hips will get wider. This might make you feel like you are gaining weight, but you are actually just developing a more womanly shape. You may be tempted to diet when you see your body changing to get back the shape you had before, but you should instead focus on eating healthy.


Focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains like whole wheat, oatmeal, and brown rice, and drinking lots of fat-free and low-fat milk, which will help you develop strong bones. In addition, make sure you’re eating a good amount of protein, like fish, lean chicken, beans, nuts, and eggs to give your body energy., In addition to eating healthy, you should also exercise regularly. Exercising will help you stay healthy and feel good about your body, even with all the changes you’re going through. Try playing outside with your friends after school, playing a recreational sport, or taking up running. In addition, you might be able to use the exercise equipment at your local YMCA, like treadmills, stair steppers, stationary bikes, and weight machines. Be sure you get proper instruction before using this equipment.
You could also exercise at home by getting some exercise videos. Look for routines that will allow you to build muscle strength while also providing a cardio workout.

, Another thing you’ll experience during puberty is hair growth. You’ll begin to develop hair on your underarms and your pubic region. Ask a parent or someone you trust to help you figure out how to deal with your new hair growth.


For example, you may deal with the hair on your underarms by shaving it or starting to wear deodorant to prevent sweating and body odor.
You may also have questions about what kind of hair growth is normal. Don’t be afraid to talk to an adult about the changes you’re going through., Acne is another unfortunate symptom of puberty. As your hormones change, the glands on your face, and maybe even your back, neck, or chest, produce more oil. This excess of oil causes pimples, which can be embarrassing and annoying. To help control acne, try some of the following:


Use medicated face washes, creams, and wipes. Also, look for non-comedogenic and hypo-allergenic makeup. This type of product won’t clog your pores or cause any other skin reactions.
If your acne seems particularly bad, you can ask your parents to make you an appointment with a dermatologist, or skin doctor. They can prescribe you medication, face washes, and creams that are more powerful than what you can buy over the counter.
Avoid using oily makeup, hair products, or lotion. In addition, avoid direct sunlight when you can and don’t ever pick at, squeeze, or try to pop pimples. These things can all make acne worse.
You acne might be worse when you are on your period or if you are extra stressed out. Take especially good care of your skin during these times., During puberty you may experience a white, jelly-like discharge from your vagina. This is normal and is your body’s way of cleaning itself. If it bothers you, however, try wearing a panty liner. Your mom or an older family member can help you find the right kind of panty liner., You may start to get more attention from people, especially boys, when you go through puberty. Some of this attention may make you feel uncomfortable, but remembering a few things can help you cope:


If you ever feel uncomfortable about the attention you are getting, speak up and let the person know their actions or words are making you feel uncomfortable and you’d like them to stop. Try saying, “I don’t like when you talk to/touch me that way. Please don’t do it again.”It can be tempting to hang out with an older crowd, but you may not be ready to deal with the situations you could face by doing so—like alcohol, drugs, and sexual situations. Spend time with a trusted group of friends your age. This will help you avoid these situations. Not to mention, many of your friends are probably going through the same things and having someone to relate to can make puberty easier to deal with.People might make comments that make you feel self-conscious about how you look. Instead of dwelling on these comments, focus on the features you like about your body. For example, maybe you really like your hair or your eyes, or maybe you’ve noticed your calves are more defined since you started puberty., Many changes you experience during puberty are uncomfortable. You might feel like you’re never going to feel comfortable in your new body. When you’re feeling this way, remind yourself that puberty is a necessary phase of life and you’ll get through it. In the meantime, focus on doing things that make you feel good about yourself. For instance, spend extra time doing your hair in the morning, make sure your fingernails are painted, play a sport you’re good at, or take up a new hobby.

Express yourself creatively.,
Talk to a friend or family member.,
Take a break.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Address new sexual feelings.",How to Cope With Puberty As a Girl3," Puberty can cause you to have all kinds of new feelings and emotions. These can be overwhelming and confusing to deal with. It might help if you try to get your feelings out in a creative way on a regular basis.


For instance, write about how you’re feeling in a journal, paint a picture, join the choir, or take a dance class. Expressing yourself creatively can help you work through the new things you’re feeling during this time., You may experience mood swings during puberty. Some of these may come about because you are feeling uncomfortable with the changes that are happening to your body, which can make you feel irritated or depressed. If this is the case, it may help to talk to your friends or a close family member, like an older sister or aunt, about what you’re feeling.If you’re not sure how to bring it up to your friends or family member, try acknowledging the fact that you’ve been extra sensitive or moody lately and ask if you can talk to them about why. For example, say “I know I’ve been kind of tough to deal with lately. Can I talk to you about what’s making me act that way?”

, Mood swings can be hard to control even when you know you’re having them. However, sometimes taking a small break from the situation can help you calm down and even out your mood. When you feel yourself getting overly irritated or sensitive, take a break and do something to calm yourself.


For example, count to 10 or sing a verse from your favorite song in your head. Sometime just taking a few minutes to focus on yourself instead of the situation can help you feel more calm., Not getting enough rest can make your already rough mood swings even worse. Being tired can cause you to feel extra irritated or make coping with your emotions more difficult. Aim to get at least eight hours of sleep every night so you can feel refreshed and ready for your day in the morning.Try some of the following tips to help you get a good night’s sleep:


Try to stick to the same sleep schedule every day. You might want to sleep in or stay up late on weekends, but it can help you sleep better if you stick to the same schedule every day. For example, if you get up at 7:00am for school, try to get up around this time on the weekends too.
Pay attention to what you eat and drink before bed. Being hungry or super full can make it difficult to sleep. Also, drinking too much before bed can cause you to have to get up multiple times in the middle of the night, interrupting your sleep.
Coming up with a bedtime ritual can also help you sleep. For example, listen to soothing music or read a book before going to bed. Stay away from watching TV or playing on your phone because electronic activities can actually interfere with sleep.
Make sure your room is cool, dark, and quiet. These conditions are ideal for sleeping. You can get room-darkening shades, ear plugs, or a fan to help create these conditions., Another thing you’ll deal with during puberty is an increase in sexual feelings. This might mean you begin to develop crushes, start to think about other people as “more than friends,” and become more curious about the opposite sex. These feelings are probably new to you so it can be a very confusing time. Do some of the following to help you cope with this aspect of puberty:


Talk to a trusted, mature adult about sexual health. Reading about sexual health can be helpful, too, but an adult can help you better understand your new feelings and educate you on the different aspects of sexual health.Ease into dating by going on group dates or dates that include some kind of activity. For example, go to the movies, play laser tag, or go to a school sporting event.You may feel pressured to engage in sexual situations if your friends and peers are, but remember that everyone is different. Never do anything you’re uncomfortable with."

Write down any questions or concerns you have.,
Talk to an adult.",How to Cope With Puberty As a Girl4," Dealing with the effects of puberty is hard, but it can help you cope with them if you understand what you’re going through. Try finding some books about puberty at your school or local library or searching for articles online about what happens to a girl’s body during puberty. You can also ask your school nurse or doctor to recommend some books that will help you understand puberty. In addition, they may have some pamphlets they can give you to start., If you have questions about what will happened to your body and mind during puberty while you’re reading, write these questions and concerns down. You may feel more prepared to talk to an adult if you have a list of questions about the topic.


Your questions might include things like: When can I expect to see changes in my body? What do I do if I get my period and I’m not at home? Am I going to look different than the other girls in my class?

, All women have gone through puberty at one time. Ask your mom to answer any questions you have about what kind of changes you’ll face during puberty and how you can handle them. You can also try talking to an older sister, your doctor, your school nurse, or female teachers or coaches about what to expect during puberty and how to cope with it."

Get a hobby.,
Stay physically active.,
Journal.,
Learn mindfulness.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Get adequate rest.",How to Balance Teenage Life1," Having something to do that you enjoy can enhance the balance in your life as a teen. You might be a part of extracurricular activities, but these responsibilities may not necessarily classify as “fun.” You may not have even chosen them for yourself; a parent may be influenced you to join. Find an activity that you like to engage in regularly.Hobbies give you a chance to pursue and develop new skills, relax, and meet people. Try joining an interesting club or organization at your school or in the community that’s not related to academics. Join a swim team at the local YMCA. Volunteer at an animal shelter. Learn to play a musical instrument.
A hobby should be an activity that you enjoy doing for yourself--not because your mom or dad says so. Choose an activity that you can engage in regularly. But keep in mind that there's no pressure. If you feel like doing it, do it. If not, do something else. Don't view it as an obligation like school sports or clubs.;
, Regular exercise is an important element to leading a healthy life. When you exercise, your body produces chemicals called endorphins that lift your mood. In addition to a mood-boost, physical activity can also help you manage your weight, fight stress, and even improves academic performance.Opt for 30-60 minutes of exercise on most days of the week with activities like running, hiking, rowing, or dancing.
Remember that you get the greatest benefit from physical activity when you eat a balanced diet. Be sure to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

, As a teen, it can be a challenge to articulate your feelings sometimes. Writing out your thoughts and feelings in a journal offers an outlet to help you manage stress and problem-solve.


Find a nice notebook and pen. Unplug from technology for an hour and sit down to write. You might simply outline the happenings of your day, create stories or poems, or list some things you are grateful for.You may also utilize this time to reflect on stressors. Remind yourself that the stressful past events were only temporary. Treat your experiences as learning opportunities to help you get through any current situations. Your journal can help you reflect and strategize.

, Teens have busy lives. You may often feel like the days are flying by and you have very little connection to individual moments. You can reconnect to the present moment by practicing mindfulness. This activity helps you slow down and focus on the here and now. You can do it virtually anywhere, too.


Try fully focusing as you eat dinner each day. Don’t watch TV or other entertainment. Fix a plate of food and eat it slowly. Notice the different flavors, textures, and smells.
Another approach is to just sit in silence and focus on your five senses. Pay attention to the sights, sounds, touches, or smells around you., Practicing meditation and breathwork can help you relax and keep your mind in the present moment. It helps to slow down racing thoughts, and anxiety about your present situation or the future. Regular meditation can have a positive effect on the body, as well.For instance if you're experiencing anxiety with a racing heartbeat and rapid breathing, relaxation techniques can help bring these symptoms back to a more normal level.

, Failing to get enough shut-eye can undermine your academic performance and make you irritable. It’s important for you to get enough sleep to develop your body and boost brainpower. Teenagers should get about 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.If you find getting to sleep challenging, it may help to create a nighttime routine. An hour or so before bed, wind down by turning off your phone, TV, and computer. Take a warm bath, listen to calming music, or do some light reading.

, Iris Prager was giving advice for a living on a regular basis. You may need more time in between answering questions, whether that time is needed to gather the questions or to find the answers. Decide how often you will contribute, and when you will post answers, then stick to that schedule., You will need to promote yourself in order to find your audience to interact with. You can even start by write letters to yourself to get the advice started and give examples to the readers of types of questions they can ask and the type of advice they can expect to get in return.Promote your column on your social media page, through your local and school newspaper, or with flyers.
Tell everyone you know and meet about what you are doing and ask them to participate.

, Give clear and simple instruction on your site, or in your column describing how the reader can ask questions. Provide simple contact information like an email address or a contact form on the site.


Set up an email address specifically for the questions rather than using your personal email address.

, In order to best help the people you communicate with, it is important to understand their needs and speak their language. You speak differently to your parents then you do your friends or your teachers or someone who runs a business. Figure out the needs and communication style of your particular audience.Determine their level of knowledge regarding the issues you are addressing. You may need to provide background information and examples to help them understand what you are telling them.
You may be using terms you are familiar with from your research, but they may be entirely new to the readers. Define any terms which may not be common knowledge among your readers.

, If the readers are going to take action based on your advice you want to be sure that you have given them enough information to work with.

Eat meals at the dinner table away from sources of entertainment.,
Appreciate the food.,
Put the fork down between bites.,
Check for hunger before eating.,
Know how to identify emotional eating.,
Monitor your child's eating habits.",How to Avoid Raising an Emotional Eater1," When kids eat meals in front of the television or iPad, they are detached from the nourishment itself. Eating becomes something that is associated with entertainment instead and your child has no idea how much they are eating. Stop this habit and enjoy meals together at the table. Have polite conversation or listen to classical music while you eat.


Avoid snacking while watching TV, too. Aim to have all meals at the table without any source of entertainment present so they can tune into their bodies.Avoid providing snacks throughout the day. You may want to limit all forms of eating to specific times of day and only at a kitchen table.;
, Before your family digs in at the dinner table, have everyone pause for a moment to appreciate the food being served. You might walk them through this process a few times at first. Then, do the exercise silently.


Think about where the food came from. The distance it had to travel to make it to your plate.
Send out some gratitude to all the people involved in providing the meal before you (e.g. the farmers, the workers, the grocers, the cook, etc.)
Spend some time admiring the many colors, textures, and smells associated with each meal. Activate your five senses to truly connect with the food in front of you., Kids may shove down food without thinking if parents don’t put appropriate practices in place. Encourage mindful eating by recommending that everyone return their forks to their plates after taking a bite. Take small bites. Chew each mouthful at least 20 times before swallowing., Instruct them to listen to their bodies. Kids should sit down to eat when they are actually hungry—not simply because others are eating or it’s a mealtime. Have them perform a hunger test.


For instance, if they are truly hungry, a real, whole food item should do the trick (i.e. meat and vegetables). If the hunger is for a specific junk food item, it may be emotional hunger, not physical hunger.To keep your kids on an appropriate eating schedule, limit excessive snacking between meals. Have them eat something approximately every 3 to 4 hours, but let them use their bodies as a guide.
Sugar can be extremely addictive.If your child frequently craves sugar, you may want to wean them off of sugary foods. You may want to contact a therapist or doctor for help.

, Emotional hunger typically arrives as a psychological craving in the head and doesn’t match hunger felt by a twinge in the stomach that develops between meals. Also, this type of hunger often appears due to situational cues like when you're in a high-stress environment, when you're facing a challenging problem, or when you're bored.Take time to investigate the causes behind your hunger before giving in to emotional cravings. If you recognize that situational factors are influencing your hunger, find adaptive ways to cope like exercising or calling a friend.

, When your child starts looking for snacks, you should write down what their behavior or emotional state is at the time. You may find a behavioural pattern that causes them to seek comfort in food. If you can alter this pattern, you may be able to reduce the habit of eating emotionally.


For example, if you notice that your child wants to eat every time they are doing stressful homework, then you can take steps to teach them how to cope with stress at school.

Consult a patients' rights advocate.,
Talk to a trusted friend or family member.,
Work with your own counselor or therapist.,
Search for an appropriate attorney near you.,
Sign a retainer agreement.",How to Avoid Psychiatric Commitment in California1," Patients' rights advocates are present in every mental health facility in California. Their job is to explain your rights to you and advocate for your best interests in the commitment proceedings.The patient advocate has no clinical or administrative responsibility for any mental health services you receive while you are undergoing evaluation.
The patient advocate is not your attorney, and cannot give you legal advice. However, they can answer your questions about the commitment procedure and California state law regarding involuntary psychiatric commitment, including your rights under state law.
They also have the ability to investigate any complaints you may have about your treatment at the facility.;
, Since you likely are in a hospital receiving treatment, you may be unable to get the legal assistance you need on your own. A trusted friend or family member can assist you by gathering documents or interviewing attorneys.You also may be able to avoid psychiatric commitment if you have a friend or family member who is willing to care for you and offer you shelter after the evaluation period.
You have the right, during your 72-hour evaluation period, to see visitors every day, as well as have access to telephones to make and receive confidential calls.
Check the facility where you've been admitted to find out their visitation policy and the hours of the day when you may use the phone or receive visitors.
If the phones aren't placed in an area where you feel comfortable, ask a staff member where you can make a phone call and have some privacy.

, If you were already seeing a counselor or therapist for your mental condition, try to meet with them as soon as possible after your 72-hour holding period begins. They will be able to guide your care.You have the right to treatment that is the least restrictive of your personal liberty and still protects your welfare and the welfare of others.
If you already were seeing someone for your mental condition, and simply had a lapse, the courts typically will favor their recommendations for your continued care.
Your own counselor or therapist also will be able to speak to whether you continue to be a danger to yourself or others.

, Work with a trusted friend or family member to locate an attorney who represents mental health patients in involuntary commitment proceedings. Look for someone who has experience helping clients avoid psychiatric commitment.The patient advocate in the facility where you've been committed may be able to recommend attorneys who are qualified to represent you.
Have a friend or family member evaluate any attorneys recommended to assess their experience and qualifications.
Ideally, you should interview two or three attorneys yourself before you make a decision to hire someone. They can visit you at the institution or call you.
Because while you are being held for evaluation you have no way of knowing whether you will be committed, it may not be wise to hire an attorney at this point. However, it's still a good idea to talk to one.

, If you find an attorney you trust and who you believe will help you avoid involuntary commitment, make sure you sign a written retainer agreement specifying exactly what you will pay them and what they will do for you.If you're talking to attorneys during the evaluation hold, you may want to go ahead and hire someone immediately if you have the means to do so. Hearings happen very quickly, and you may not have time to hire someone later.
Keep in mind that if you are unable to afford a private attorney, you may be able to get assistance from a public defender if the mental health professionals who complete your evaluation make the decision to commit you.
The patients' rights advocate who has been working with you also has the ability to represent you at your certification review hearing.
Your patients' rights advocate must present your point of view during all hearings and review proceedings. This means that if you want to be released, your advocate must argue for your release, even if they personally feel otherwise.

Identify your priorities.,
Set objective goals.,
Break down big projects into smaller segments.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Balance Teenage Life2," Life can quickly fall out of balance if you don’t have your priorities straight. Think about the activities and task that are most important (or have the greatest urgency) to you, and focus on them. This way you’re not bogged down trying to do everything.You can identify priorities by spending a little time each Sunday thinking about the demands of the week ahead. Jot down any important events or appointments, projects or tests, and chores/responsibilities.
Then, go through and create a practical schedule for each day that includes all your priorities. If you have gotten the most important things out of the way, you will feel more inclined to relax.

, It’s great to have big goals, but sometimes having high expectations can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. Be realistic about what you’re taking on in terms of your academic course load, extracurricular activities, work responsibilities, and social engagements. Review your goals to make sure they are feasible. Then, take small action towards them daily.


For instance, you might want to become a better trumpet player. This goal is awesome, but it’s unclear. Saying, “I will practice for 30 minutes five days a week” offers a much more doable way to obtain the goal., Huge projects and assignments can wear away at your sanity. You may feel overwhelmed at the magnitude of work you must put in to complete the task. It helps to divide large projects into smaller pieces. Then, set deadlines for you to complete each individual part until the entire project is finished.For instance, if you have a five-page history paper, you might start by doing research. Then, outline your paper. Write a rough draft. Review your resources, edit and rewrite. Then, proofread again before submitting it.

, Be willing to admit when you’re in over your head. Life gets busy for everyone, so you won’t be judged for confessing to being overwhelmed. Talk to a friend, parent, teacher or counselor. These people may be able to offer advice or resources to help you cope."

Make friends who are positive influences.,
Take dating slow.,
Spend time with family often.,
Schedule time away for yourself.",How to Balance Teenage Life3," When you hang out with people who support and value who you are as a person, life feels more manageable. Plus, hanging with negative influences often adds more trouble to your life, such as a bad reputation or failing grades. Form relationships with positive peers from school organizations, sports groups, or community organizations.


Healthy friendships involve two people who care for on another, respect each other’s boundaries, and have mutual goals and interests.Stay away from peers who bully, manipulate, lie, skip classes or use drugs and alcohol.

, When your parents give you the OK to date, you might immediately fall down a rabbit hole. You become obsessed with your date, pick up their habits, and even drop your hobbies in favor of theirs. Although it’s wonderful to want to show your partner that you sincerely care for them, it’s also smart to maintain some balance.Slow down and move at a pace you are comfortable with. Let your date know what you will and won’t accept. Don’t become physically intimate with them until you are absolutely ready.
What’s more, don’t drop your old life when you get a new relationship. Stay in touch with your friends and keep participating in your favorite hobbies. It’s important for healthy relationships to involve some space for you to pursue separate interests.

, Friendships and romantic relationships often overshadow familial bonds during the teen years because you may feel like your peers naturally understand you better. Still, it’s essential to have positive family interactions, too. Maintain a balance of peer time and family time.Sit down to meals with your family rather than eating on the go. Walk your younger siblings to school or the local park. Find a TV show you can watch with a parent for one-on-one bonding time. Offer to stay home one weekend for a family game night.

, Be open about your personal needs. Sometimes, life is just too much. Don’t feel guilty about cancelling plans or saying “no” to a new responsibility. It’s important to recognize when you need time to regroup and take it.It can help to schedule in some “me-time” each week. This may be a few hours of self-care or a full afternoon set aside to treat yourself. Nap, watch movies, read, or take a reflective walk in nature to ease your mind.

Model balanced eating habits.,
Avoid labeling any food as “bad.” Kids can feel guilty or ashamed about eating certain foods when negative connotations are attached to them.,
Don’t use food as an activity to substitute boredom.,
Discourage using food to cheer people up or treat them.,
Refrain from eating out of packages.",How to Avoid Raising an Emotional Eater2," When parents demonstrate healthy eating patterns, their kids are more likely to follow suit. Healthy eating patterns involve being conscientious and aware of your dietary habits, but not obsessive or anxious. Set a good example by enjoying a nutritious diet while eliminating any notions of “dieting” from your vocabulary.


Serve yourself small portions of meals derived from the major food groups. Only return for seconds after you have sat for a while, drank some water, and are sure your body wants more.
Don’t use negative self-talk such as “I’m fat.” Help your child develop a positive body image.Do not criticize your child for their emotional eating or scold them about their weight. This will only lead to more emotional eating and resentment.
Make healthy eating fun for children. Have them help you while you cook dinner, or let them read nutritional labels as you grocery shop. This will help teach them about healthy eating habits.

, Avoid guilt-tripping yourself or your kids when you overeat on processed, sugary, junk foods. Instead, offer a casual reminder about the types of foods that help fuel your body and give it energy. Enjoy more of those., Boredom is a common factor associated with emotional eating. Sometimes kids with nothing to do find themselves at the fridge, looking for something to give them temporary pleasure. Help your kids understand when they are bored and offer adaptive activities to do instead of eating.If your child complains of being bored, don’t offer a snack. Suggest they read a book, complete a puzzle, play a game with a sibling or friend, or go outside to play.

, Society often uses food as a “reward” of sorts. A child brings home straight-A’s and parents treat them to ice cream. The feature of any party is usually the cake. Prevent emotional eating habits from developing by resisting associating feeding with comfort or rewards.


Find other ways to treat (or cheer up) your kids, such as a family outing to the park or the local cinema., If you or your children eat from packages, it’s a recipe for disaster. When packages contain several servings, it can be hard to stop. You just might end up consuming the entire package before your body sends the message that you’re full.


Break down snack items such a crackers, nuts, or fruit when you bring them home. Divide them into appropriate serving sizes and place in snack-sized bags or containers.
Try your best to eat most meals from a plate. This helps you become more aware of portion sizes and increases your feelings of satiety.Kids may try to get their own snacks when you are not looking. If this is a problem, you may need to lock your pantry. Hand out snacks as you see fit.

"
"
Help them learn to identify and label emotions.,
Offer an empathetic ear.,
Buy them a journal.,
Create a personal self-care toolbox for them.,
See a therapist.",How to Avoid Raising an Emotional Eater3," Learning to regulate emotions is an essential skill for leading a healthy life with positive relationships. Kids who impulsively act on their emotions can wind up in trouble. However, emotional regulation starts with you. Set a good example by effectively managing your own emotions. Then, teach them the skills to do the same.Help them see that all emotions are useful and normal, even negative ones.
Challenge them to name the emotions they feel. Let’s say they are overlooked to join a team at the gym. This may cause feelings of embarrassment or rejection. A best friend moves away. They may feel sad.
Tell them to write down how each emotions feels in their body so they can better recognize them next time around.

, In addition to helping your child label emotions, you also need to be willing to provide an outlet. Listening can be an invaluable tool that demonstrates to your children that “your emotions are important.” Try to connect when your child is overwrought with emotion. This may mean asking them if they want to talk or simply spending quality time with them.You might say, “I can see that you are having a difficult time. Do you want to talk?” If not, you might say, “How about we go and feed the ducks together? I know that’s one of your favorite activities.” During an activity, your child might feel more comfortable opening up.
Resist the urge to judge or fix. Simply be present with your child when they are experiencing big emotions.

, Journaling can be a terrific way to release emotions. It gives kids an outlet and helps them see patterns in their thoughts and feelings. It can be a very effective way for them to learn problem-solving skills, too.Encourage your child to use writing to express their feelings. They can merely free write whatever comes to mind. Or, they can create a short story or poem. They can also doodle in their journal to attach visual images to their thoughts and feelings.
Take your kid shopping for a journal that matches their individual style. Get them nice pens or color pencils to make the process more fun.

, Self-care is a powerful tool for mental health and well-being. Sadly, many adults and kids overlook this needed practice. Encourage your child to build a self-care practice early in life to manage emotions, de-stress, and improve their mood.


Make it a fun project by finding artsy materials to decorate and design a box to fit their personality. Then, fill it with meaningful objects that help them relax, such as fun books, favorite CDs or DVDs, coloring books, inspiring quotes and a cozy blanket., If your child's emotional eating is having a severe mental or physical impact on their life, you may need to consult a therapist. A therapist can help determine if your child has an underlying issue, social or academic struggles at school, or problems handling stress during major life events. They can provide professional advice and teach your child healthy coping mechanisms that do not involve food.

If you behave appropriately and present yourself in a calm, dignified manner, the hearing officer will be more open to your evidence.When you arrive at the hearing, sit up straight and pay attention when others are speaking. Don't interrupt anyone, and treat everyone present with respect.
The hearing officer may be a judge, but the hearing is not held in a courtroom and is not a trial. You don't have to call them ""your honor,"" but you should show deference by calling them ""sir"" or ""ma'am.""
When you are asked a question, speak in a loud, clear voice so everyone can hear you. If you have difficulty speaking, you may want to have your patient advocate explain this at the beginning of the hearing.

, At the certification review hearing, the director of the facility where you were admitted for your 72-hour evaluation will present evidence supporting the decision to have you committed.To have you committed, the director must show probable cause that you are a continuing danger to yourself or others, or that you are so disabled that you cannot care for yourself.
The director likely will present information and reports produced as a result of your evaluation. You have the right to a written copy of all information presented at the hearing.
Mental health professionals responsible for your treatment or evaluation also may speak in favor of your commitment.
You have the right to question anyone who speaks in favor of your commitment. This isn't supposed to be as confrontational as cross-examination in a courtroom setting. Rather, the hearing officer will attempt to mediate a dialogue regarding your commitment.

, You have the right to be present at your certification review hearing and to testify on your own behalf against involuntary commitment. You also have the right to present evidence or witnesses to support your case.This is not a criminal hearing, and the rules of evidence and procedure that apply in courtroom trials do not apply at certification review hearings.
If you have family members who have attended your hearing and want to present evidence on your behalf, they typically must provide this information to your patient advocate or your attorney.
Your witnesses may be allowed to speak themselves in some circumstances. Talk to your attorney or patient advocate ahead of time if you have a preference.
If a family member has made an offer to provide you food, clothing, or shelter upon your release, this offer must be presented in writing.

, Once the judge has heard from both sides, they will make a decision whether to allow your release or have you committed for a longer period. If the hearing officer does not find probable cause that you are a danger to yourself or others, you will be released.The hearing officer will let you know their decision at the end of the hearing. However, it may be a day or two before you receive a written decision.
If the hearing officer finds probable cause that you still present a danger to yourself or others, you can be committed involuntarily for an additional 14 days.

Talk to your attorney or advocate.,
File your request for a hearing.,
Show up for your hearing.,
Present your case to the judge.,
Pay attention to the other side.,
Receive the judge's decision.",How to Avoid Psychiatric Commitment in California3," You technically can request a writ of habeas corpus hearing at any time, including during your 72-hour hold. However, if you request a hearing before a certification review hearing, you lose your right to a certification review hearing.Generally, you want to take advantage of the certification review hearing. The entire process is much less formal than a writ hearing, and strict court rules of evidence and procedure do not apply.
Additionally, there is a possibility that you will be released following evaluation during the 72-hour hold.
This period gives both you and the mental health professionals who evaluate you the opportunity to further assess the situation and make an informed decision.

, Habeas corpus hearings, also called judicial review hearings, are not scheduled automatically. If the hearing officer decides you should be committed for a longer period of time, and you want that decision to be reviewed, you must request a hearing.If you want to request a habeas corpus or judicial review hearing after the hearing officer at your certification review hearing finds probable cause to have you committed, let the hearing officer know.
The hearing officer will prepare a request form for you that you must sign. The request form must be filed that day. The hearing officer will file it for you.
According to state law, your hearing must be held within two days of the date your request is received.

, Your hearing will be held in a courtroom at the superior court of the county where you're located. At your habeas corpus hearing, you are entitled to be represented either by a private attorney of your choosing or by a court-appointed attorney (if you can't afford to hire a private attorney).Make sure you're given the appropriate opportunity to shower and groom yourself before the hearing, as well as change into appropriate attire.
While you may want to dress slightly more formally for your courtroom appearance, more casual attire generally is appropriate as long as your clothing is clean and presentable.
Try to arrive at the courthouse at least a half hour before the time of your hearing. It will take time to go through security at the courthouse and find the courtroom where your hearing is being held.
When you find the courtroom, you typically will take a seat in the gallery. The judge may be hearing several other cases the same day as yours.

, At your habeas corpus hearing, you will have the opportunity to tell the judge why there is no probable cause to continue to detain you involuntarily in the mental health facility.Focus on evidence that indicates you do not present a danger to yourself or others. You probably want to speak on your own behalf, but you also can call witnesses if you want.
Any friends or family members who have agreed to shelter you or provide support and assistance after your release can make very strong witnesses.
If you were seeing a counselor or therapist before your commitment, they can provide excellent evidence in support of you as well.
Another point that works in your favor is a willingness to continue treatment voluntarily. Make it known to the judge that just because you are fighting commitment doesn't mean you don't want help. You just want to seek help on your own terms.

, The director of the mental health facility, as well as others such as possibly the state district attorney, also will have the opportunity to justify the facility's finding that you should be committed for further treatment.You will have the opportunity, through your attorney, to question anyone who speaks in favor of your commitment.
Your attorney's goal will be to introduce doubt or uncertainty in the minds of the mental health professionals who made the decision to commit you.
Pay attention when the other side is speaking. Don't shout out or interrupt, and watch your body language. Keep in mind that the judge will be watching you as well as listening to them.

, After hearing from both sides, the judge will decide whether to continue your commitment or release you. You will find out the judge's decision immediately after the hearing has concluded.If the judge decides there is no probable cause justifying your commitment, you will be released immediately.
However, you do have the right to stay on as a patient at the same facility if you so choose. You also can seek treatment at another facility of your choosing.
If you have a family member who has agreed to house and look after you, you will be released into their care.

Just because you have experienced a trauma doesn’t mean that you should attend any trauma therapist or group therapy session. While dealing with some aspects of trauma are the same, your individual trauma will dictate how your therapist approaches your recovery and treatment. You need to decide the type of trauma therapy you need. Trauma can have occurred only once or have been chronic/reoccurring. Common categories include:Sexual, physical, or emotional abuse or assault
Neglect
Accident, illness, or medical procedure
Victim/witness to domestic or community violence
School violence or bullying
Disasters
Displacement
Terrorism, war, or military trauma
Exposure to homicide, suicide, or other extreme violence
Grief;
, If you have experienced a trauma at some point in your life, you may find that you are experiencing negative symptoms associated with the trauma. Trauma therapy can help you on the road to recovery. Before you start therapy, you need to find a mental health professional that has experience treating trauma patients. Look for mental health professionals who have licenses and degrees from accredited programs and institutions.You may ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma. You can also contact local hospitals or mental health clinics to find a trauma therapist.
When looking for a trauma specialist, you want to make sure the therapist has experience or knowledge in your particular trauma area. Some people suffer trauma from sexual assault, car accidents, war, or being involved in terrorist attacks. You want to find a trauma therapist who can help your specific trauma.
Online databases are available that can help you find trauma therapists in your area. Browse Good Therapy or Psychology Today’s databases for a list of therapists in your area. Other psychology websites may also list specialists in your area.
Also, most insurance companies keep on file the areas of concentration of counselors in their network. Contacting your insurance company can be a helpful start.

, Trauma therapy comes in different forms. You can look for one specific kind of therapy program, or you can try a combination of different methods. You and your therapist can discuss the pros and cons of each, or you can choose a therapy treatment that you think will be the most beneficial to you.Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a common treatment for trauma. During CBT, you will be helped to replace negative thoughts with healthier thoughts. This includes exposure therapy (where you are exposed to things associated with the trauma to help lessen your anxiety) and relaxation training. CBT also helps to deal with depression or anxiety associated with the trauma.
Psychotherapy is another treatment option. This includes talk therapy and other therapy methods where you discuss the traumatic event, sort through memories, address your anxieties, and work on normalizing the experience.
Group therapy is another option. In group therapy, you join with other trauma survivors and discuss your experiences, difficulties, losses, and coping techniques. Group therapy sessions are facilitated by a trained mental health professional.

, You can go to different types of therapy programs, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Choose the therapy program that you think will be the most beneficial to you. Other considerations include what your insurance pays for and the type of treatment therapists and clinics offer in your area.The most common type of therapy program is outpatient therapy sessions. This is where you attend 45 to 50 minute sessions once or twice a week.
You may decide you need intensive outpatient therapy. These programs may meet multiple times a week for 90 to 120 minutes.
You may choose to go to an in-patient facility. You can choose a day program, where you stay at a clinic from 9 to 5, three to five days a week. You may also choose to be hospitalized or stay at a long-term care facility for a few weeks.
Intensive outpatient therapy and inpatient hospitalization often involve commuting or travel, while outpatient therapy can usually be found locally. This is partially why outpatient therapy is more common.

, There are different symptoms associated with suffering from trauma. Before going to therapy, you should think about your trauma symptoms and get a clear picture of how your trauma is affecting you. Sharing this with your therapist can help them get a clearer picture of your condition.Determine when the trauma happened so you know how long it has been affecting you. Some people don’t experience any symptoms or negative effects of the trauma for years. Again, keep in mind that this could have been a one-time event (such as an assault) or a series of exposures that happened over a period of time (like an abusive relationship).
You may experience avoidance symptoms. This includes avoiding triggers or reminders of the event.
You may have flashbacks, nightmares, or unwanted thoughts about the event.
You may find that you are angrier, more irritable, more aggressive, or more reckless than usual.
You may be hypervigilant and alert all the time.
You may experience anxiety, depression, guilt, or problems sleeping.
You may find that you feel numb, have lost interest in activities, or a major change in behavior since the trauma.
You may find that you are fearful to leave the house and experience symptoms of panic when you do.
You may have significant trouble focusing and impaired memory as well. You may have difficulty remembering the event.

, Before you go to see a psychiatrist, therapist, or counselor, you may want to go get a physical exam. Some medical problems cause similar psychological symptoms as mental conditions. You want to rule out any medical problems as the cause of your symptoms before undergoing therapy.Many trauma survivors experience physical as well as emotional symptoms. Your physician and therapist may work together to treat your condition.

, Many insurance companies will cover the cost of therapy, and some therapists accept insurance plans. Before you go to therapy, figure out what your insurance company pays for, how many sessions it will cover, what your co-pay will be, and if there are any restrictions for coverage.


Most insurance companies cover therapists that are in their network.
Therapy sessions usually cost between $50 to $150 before insurance coverage. If you don’t have insurance that will cover this, you should figure out how to pay for your sessions. There are generally community mental health centers in each municipality that offer services to uninsured individuals.

, Trauma recovery is aided by learning how to function in your real life and learning how to live again. This usually involves a support system of friends and family. Figure out which family and friends you have who could be your support system on your road to recovery as you go through counseling and face your trauma.


For example, you may say to your family or friends, ""I am not recovering from my trauma like I had hoped. I want to go get counseling, but I'm nervous and unsure. It would really help me if I could come to you for support and strength when things get tough during my therapy.""

, Trauma survivors have a unique condition that needs specific treatment. Though a qualified therapist who knows how to treat mental illness is needed, trauma survivors need therapists who are really listening to them and validating their experiences. During your first few sessions, pay attention to therapist to see if you feel like they are listening to you.Keep in mind the first few sessions involve gathering information, building rapport, providing psychoeducation about trauma and what to expect, and setting goals for treatment. It may take some time before you feel any better or notice improvement.
A therapist should aim to make you feel empowered, since many trauma survivors feel powerless or like they have no control over their circumstances. Some believe a trauma therapist who focuses on empowerment rather than “curing” you is better for trauma treatment.
Decide if you are an equal partner in your treatment, or if the therapist has all the power. Part of trauma treatment includes you taking control of your treatment and your life.

, In trauma therapy, your therapist will help you examine the experience you have gone through. This may be uncomfortable for you and take multiple sessions to fully complete. Facing the experience is a way to lessen the hold it has over you.You also will think about the role the trauma has in your life.
Your therapist will encourage you to make meaning out of the experience in some way.

, One aim of therapy for trauma survivors is to help you learn how to trust again. Because of the nature of your trauma, you may be distrusting of people, groups, relationships, family members, or friends. You may even distrust the world in general. In therapy, you will work on this.The goal of therapy is to help you come to a state where you can have healthy relationships with the people and the world around you.

, Cognitive behavior therapy, psychotherapy, and group therapy are three common types of therapy for trauma counseling. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is often used in trauma therapy to help you replace your negative thoughts with healthier ones. CBT is used to help you cope and manage your symptoms. It also can be used to help you build trust with others and combat any anxiety or depression you experience due to your trauma.Psychotherapy, including talk therapy, is an effective therapy for trauma. In psychotherapy, you talk about your experience because talking about your trauma is part of the healing and recovery process.Exposure therapy may be part of your psychotherapy treatment. Your therapist may expose you to videos or images of related traumas to help familiarize yourself with the idea to help you learn how to let go of your own trauma.
Your trauma therapist may suggest that you attend group therapy as part of your recovery. Group therapy is a safe space where you interact with other trauma survivors. Though your therapist may suggest group therapy for you, you are in control of your treatment plan and recovery. If you don’t feel comfortable with group therapy, you can choose not to attend., Pharmacotherapy is a type of therapy where medication is prescribed to help physical or mental symptoms of trauma. Medication is usually helpful if you experience depression, irritability, hypervigilance or alertness, emotional distress, or intrusive symptoms such as sleep disturbances. Medication helps manage symptoms but does not make them go away.You will work with a psychiatrist if you decide to take medication. Most of the time, medication is used in conjunction with psychotherapy.

, There are other kinds of therapy that might be helpful for trauma survivors. You and your therapist may discuss your treatment goals and therapy options that may help your particular situation. Other types of therapy include:Art therapy
Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR)
Play therapy
Hypnotherapy

If they ask you to help out, to turn down your music, or to join them for dinner with your aunt and uncle, then you should do as they say as much as possible. Of course, if their demands are completely unreasonable, then you should have a nice, open conversation with them, but as a rule of thumb, you can be a good boy and make your parents happy by listening to what they tell you to do.


If your grandparents or other adults live in your home, then you should listen to them, too.
When your parents are talking to you, make sure you look them in the eye and that you put away your phone. Make them see that you really care.;
, If you want to be a good boy, then you should help clean up messes instead of creating them. Work to clean up after yourself, do your own laundry, and help your parents with daily tasks like throwing out the trash, taking the dog for a walk, wiping down the kitchen table, or anything else that you can do to lighten the load. If you have required chores, then you should do them without grumbling and even go above and beyond when it comes to housework.


You shouldn’t have to ask if you need to help or what you can do. Instead, be observant and look around to see what really needs to be cleaned up or fixed, from a sink of overflowing dishes to a hamper of clean laundry that needs to be folded.

, Another way to be a good boy is to be nice to your siblings, whether they are older or younger. If you’re the older sibling, you should serve a role model for your siblings and should help them grow more mature and reasonable as they get older. If you’re a younger sibling, then you should be nice and avoid taunting or teasing your older siblings too much and let them have their own space. Being a good sibling is an important part of being a good boy, and you should try to get along with your siblings as much as you can.


You should also help your parents out by spending time with your siblings so they don’t always have to watch over them. If your siblings are upset, help them sort their problems out when you can so your parents can have some time to themselves.
Avoiding fights with your siblings will help you be a good boy because you’ll be helping make things easier around the house.

, Another thing you can do to be a good boy is to obey the rules your parents have set forward. This can mean sticking to your curfew, waking up at a certain time, doing the chores you were meant to do, cleaning up after yourself, only spending a certain amount of time on your phone or computer, and so on. If you want to be a good boy, then you should obey the rules you are given and only question them if you really think you need to talk to your parents about it.


Disregarding your parents’ rules shows them that you don’t respect or care for them as much as you could. You have to show them how much you appreciate their parenting by listening to them.
If you have siblings, it's important to follow your parents’ rules so that you set a good example for your brother or sister.

, Being a good boy doesn’t mean being perfect all the time. It does, however, mean that you should apologize when you feel like you’ve made a mistake. If you want to be a good boy, then you have to learn when you have done something wrong and be ready to admit it. To truly apologize, look your parents and siblings in the eyes and give them a sincere and honest apology to show that you’ve put a lot of thought into what you’ve done and that you won’t do it again.


Don’t just say you’re sorry while you’re doing something else or heading out the door. Take the time to sit down with your parents and take the time to let them know you really messed up.

, The best thing you can do as a good boy is to make your parents’ lives easier. This can mean doing extra chores when you’re not asked, being extra obedient on days when you can see that your parents are extra tired, spending time with your siblings to give your parents more time off, or even giving your parents space when they’re tired and want to lie down. Most parents are overwhelmed by their parenting duties, and if you try to make their lives easier instead of creating problems, then they will be grateful to you for it.


As you get older, you can help them run more errands, like picking up a few groceries, washing the car at home, or helping get your younger siblings ready for school.
If you see that your parents come home upset, try helping cook dinner or ask if you can pick up some pizza to make things easier.

, You may think that there’s only so much you can do because you’re too young to really help out, but you can always learn more ways to help. If your parents do your laundry or wash your dishes for you, learn to do it yourself. If your parents always take care of the dog or cat, you should learn when they need to be fed and when to take out the dog. You can even learn to cook simple things, or to make yourself sandwiches for lunch so your parents don’t have to do it.


Don’t think that you can’t really help because you’re too young; instead, be a good boy and always look out for new ways to help out.

, Another way to be a good boy is to work on becoming a smarter, more interesting person. This can mean spending more time reading and writing, teaching yourself a foreign language, learning a skill such as soccer or playing guitar, and generally caring about self-improvement. Though watching TV or playing games online can make for a fun break, you should attempt to grow as a person as much as you can if you want to be a good boy.


Part of being a good boy means becoming more mature and growing as a person. Learning new skills and educating yourself can help you become a more thoughtful, well-rounded individual.

, Another way to be a good boy is to make sure to listen to your parents in public. Avoid contradicting them, ignoring them, openly disregarding their rules, throwing tantrums, or doing anything that would make them feel embarrassed and disappointed in you. If you disagree with them about something, bring it up later, when you’re alone at home, so you can have a productive conversation with them instead of throwing a fit.


Even if you really, really want something your parents won’t give you right then, you should avoid embarrassing or making them feel bad. This will make them upset and can hurt your relationship with them. Instead, do the mature thing and avoid throwing a tantrum and ask if you can talk about it later.

, One of the best ways to be a good boy is to listen to your teachers. You should respect them and recognize that they’re just people, too, and that it’s rude and unkind to ignore them, be mean to them, or even question them. Make an effort to do as your teachers say and not to cause problems in the classroom. Not only will listening to your teachers make them happier, but it will make your parents happier, too.


If you really struggle with listening to your teachers or think they are being completely unreasonable, then you should be as nice as you can to them and talk to your parents to discuss next steps.

, You don’t need to get perfect grades to do well in school. However, you should make an effort to do as well as you can, to study for your exams, to do your homework, and to generally be a dedicated student. When you need help, come to your teachers or your parents for help, and make an effort to always improve. Good boys tend to do well in school, because they know that success in the classroom is important.


Make an effort to study for your exams well in advance so you get the best results.
What’s most important is that you respect the idea of education and come in to school on time and are happy to be there.

, If you want to be a good boy, then you have to be nice to your classmates, whether you’re with your lab partner or talking to some kids on the bus to school. Treating other people with kindness and respect is one major way to be a good boy. Don’t put down students who don’t do as well in school as you or make fun of people for their clothes or their general appearance. Work to truly treat others as you’d like to be treated and you’ll be on your way to being a good boy.


You may think that putting down other people will make you look better, but really, the best thing you can is to be friendly to everybody so people like you and feel comfortable around you.
If someone in class doesn’t know something, don’t make fun of that person and help him or her understand the material instead.

, Another way to be a good boy is to participate in class. This shows your teachers that you’re listening and that you care. When your teacher asks questions, you should make an effort to answer them while giving other people a chance to answer, too. If you’re interested in or confused by something, then you should ask your teacher questions when it’s appropriate. If you’re engaged in class and participate often, then you’ll be making learning more fun for yourself while being a good boy in the process.


If your teacher asks for a volunteer, help her out by participating in whatever activity she has planned.
Make sure to participate in group work, too. You should always be active and engaged with the material.

, In order to be a good boy in school, you should avoid having conflicts with your teachers and your administrators. Follow all of the rules at your school, from any dress code rules you have to follow to coming to school on time and acting respectful in the school cafeteria. If you have broken a rule, be honest about it and apologize and show that you won’t do it again. If you want to be a good boy, then listening to the rules is important.


If you want to be a good student, then it’s important to follow the rules in your school. You don’t want to develop a bad reputation with your teachers; if you do that, then it’ll be hard for them to take you seriously.

, Good boys don’t question their teachers or try to act like the smartest person in the room. Whether you’re hanging out with your friends during recess or listening to your teacher talk about George Washington, you should avoid acting like a know-it-all, or you’re likely to annoy the people around you. Though it’s important to be curious and to question things in order to reach your own conclusions, you shouldn’t show off or brag or act like you know more than other people if you want to be a good boy.


Trying to outsmart your teachers is one of the worst things you can do if you want them to like you. If you try these antics, they’ll be making a fast phone call to your parents.
Showing off in front of your friends isn’t a good idea, either. They’ll quickly get tired of your act.

, It’s important to be honest if you want to be truly good in school and outside of it. If you’re in trouble for breaking the rules, then be honest about what you did instead of lying and trying to cover it up. When it comes to tests, you should avoid cheating or engaging in other dishonest behavior and work on getting good grades honestly, through studying and hard work. If you’re dishonest in school, then that will make you dishonest in other parts of your life and will lead you to not be a good boy.


Though it’s okay to tell an occasional white lie to save a person’s feelings (such as telling your friend you like his bad haircut), it’s important to have integrity when it comes to the important stuff. Make sure to tell your teachers and parents the truth, or you’ll make a lifelong bad habit.
It’s not always easy to be honest. If you’re honest about something that is difficult to share, then you should be proud of yourself for opening up.

, Good boys tend to be organized in school, so that they can focus on their studies without making a mess. Have an organized backpack, school and home desk, notebook, and anything else you use for school. Work on separating your school subjects by folder and always knowing where everything is. If you want to succeed in school and be a good boy, then it’s important to be on top of your organizational skills.


Being organized goes hand in hand with being. Make sure that your desk at home, your desk at school, and your locker or backpack are neat and organized. Taking just 10-15 minutes a day to clean your things can help you stay on top of your studies.

, If you want to be a good boy, then it’s important to treat other people with respect. Whether they are your parents’ friends or your dentist, it’s important to be nice and respectful to the people around you and to treat them with basic kindness. Respect their space, ask them how they’re doing, and avoid asking overly personal questions. Being respectful is an important quality of a good boy as well as a good man.


Good boys are respectful, especially of their elders. Make sure to treat people who are older than you with the utmost respect, even if you may disagree with them sometimes.
When you’re in public, make sure you’re not too loud and avoid not cleaning up your mess. A restaurant or movie theatre isn’t your bedroom, and you need to be aware of the people around you.

, Another way to be a good boy is to be nice to your neighbors. Avoid making too much noise, accidentally getting on their property, ignoring them, or generally not treating them kindly. Your parents will want you to be nice to them to help make a good impression for your family, and being nice to them will make your living situation much easier. Even if you feel like you don’t have a lot in common with them, it’s always important to be nice.


Just making polite small talk can make a big difference. When you see your neighbors, just say, “Hi, how are you?” You don’t have to get wrapped up in a long conversation with them, but take the time to acknowledge them.

, One of the most important parts of being a good boy is treating girls with the kindness and respect they deserve. Be nice to them, make an effort to get to know them, and only tease them if you’re both being playful. Don’t ever make demeaning or nasty comments to a girl or make her feel bad about her looks or who she is. Even if the other boys around you aren’t mature enough to be nice to girls yet, it’s important that you break this mold and make an effort to treat them with care and kindness.


When you see a girl, be friendly and ask how she’s doing. You can even compliment her new haircut or a piece of jewelry she’s wearing.
If you’re shy about talking to girls, you don’t have to force it. The more you talk to girls little by little, the more comfortable you’ll feel about opening up to them.

, Being polite is an important part of being a good boy. Being polite means treating others with kindness and respect, avoiding being vulgar, and showing a kind interest in people. It also means avoiding any offensive topics or being rude to the people you don’t like. While you don’t have to be best friends with everyone, it doesn’t take any effort to be polite, and it can help make your social situations easier.


Being polite also means having good manners. Avoid burping in public and excuse yourself if you do. Don’t chew with your mouth full. Ask people how they’re doing when you see them. If you’re introduced to a new person, stand up to say hello. Let people pass in front of you instead of butting in in front of them.

, If you want to be a good boy, then you should work on volunteering in your community to help make the world a better place. You can volunteer with your parents, or by yourself or with some friends if you’re old enough to do that. You can help clean up a local park, help people learn to read at the library, or volunteer in a soup kitchen to help people have access to food. To be a good boy, you have to know that it’s about more than just being good at school at home, but in the world at large.


Make an effort to give at least a few hours of your time to others a month, whether you’re volunteering through your school, church, or another community organization.
If you help out with your parents, then this will also be a great bonding activity.

, To be a good boy out in the world, it’s important to spread your positive energy and to make the people around you feel happier and better about the world. You should avoid complaining or being overly negative and should work on talking about all of the good things in your life, smiling, and complimenting people instead of being negative or only focusing on the bad things in life. If you want to be a good boy, then you want to work on spreading good in the world.


Work on complimenting people instead of criticising them. It’s a better people to make people feel good about themselves than to put them down.
Work on smiling more often too. It’ll make you and the people around you feel happier.

Obtaining your drivers license is a big step to becoming more responsible and independent. You no longer have to depend on someone else, such as your parents, to drive you around or adhere to someone else’s schedule when you need to get to a date or an important meeting.Even if you decide not to get a car, having your license means you always have the option of renting a car for a trip or driving someone else’s car as their designated driver after a night out.
Getting better at cooking is a great way to gain more independence and become more confident as a person.Start small and tackle small dishes like a sandwich for lunch or a stir fry for dinner.

Displaying good manners shows respect towards others, which will then make others respect you as an adult., If you get into an argument with someone, take responsibility for your part in the confrontation and apologize to that person. If you accidentally ding your parents’ car on a night out, take responsibility for that action and tell them what happened. Owning up to your mistakes is a big part of being an adult, even if it means facing the consequences., A big part of being an adult is being willing to work on improving yourself, every day. Feedback from a teacher, a manager, or a peer can help you develop into a better adult, as long as it is constructive and not hurtful or insulting. Many adults face criticism in their work and at home. Handling the criticism with grace and openness shows you are a mature, confident person.If you do receive negative feedback, focus on how you can improve your work based on that feedback. Don't overanalyze the negative comments or whine about the negative outcome. Instead, look at how you can use the feedback in a positive way to get better at your job or at your studies.

, Approach situations with confidence and purpose, especially if it has to do with your schooling or your job. But avoid acting stuck up or arrogant towards others. This will only alienate you from other people and lead to confrontation.Being confident, rather than arrogant, will also allow you to consider other peoples' points of view and show that you can act as a good leader and role model for others.

Seek help if you are struggling.",How to Act Like a Normal Teenager," It is vital to know what is important to you, what motivates you and what makes you feel positive. During your teen years you will discover your own values, which might be different than your parents’ values. Personal values include but are not limited to: good health, ambition, cooperation, courage, humor, honesty, reliability, wealth, wisdom, strength, independence, generosity, fairness, compassion, and recognition.


Review a list of personal values and identify your top 10. Look up the meaning of the ones you don’t understand.
Determining your core values requires you to think and reflect about what is important to you.For example, ask yourself what types of situations cause you to defend yourself or someone else. What causes you to celebrate? Who do you admire? What are you passionate about? Once you answer the questions, run down the list of values and pick the ones that seem to best describe your feelings associated with the situations you identified.
Make a list of the activities you currently participate in that are in agreement with your values. If you value health and a high level of self-care find creative ways to get the 8-9 hours of sleep most teens need.Make a list of new activities to participate in that would be in agreement with your values. If you value compassion, you may find caring for animals or visiting the elderly very meaningful.
Choosing activities that are in agreement with your values will ensure a positive experience. You will enjoy being around other teens that share your values.;
, Your family, friends and the media play roles in your development. It can be hard to find your way through tough situations without help. Your brain is growing and hasn’t reached its full potential. It is normal for teenagers to be easily influenced by others.Be strong, which means speak up for yourself and what you believe in. Make a promise to yourself to make decisions that benefit you rather than harm you. Let the good things in your life influence you. Anything less will bring you down.
It is a normal part of your development to become more interested in having your own fun rather than participating only with family. You are a teenager and you are starting to develop your own values, interests and goals to create your life. If you don’t want to go to a kid’s movie with the family say, “I’d like to stay home and work on a project, if that’s okay with you.”
Your parent or parents are still legally responsible for you so you must ultimately abide by their rules until you turn 18 years of age and move into your own residence free of their financial support.
The urge to say yes is hard to resist when a friend asks you to do something that might bring harm to you. The temporary excitement of many negative activities will cause damage to you in the long run. Be smart and think about the consequences of your behavior before you decide to participate.
If you feel yourself trying to live up to an unrealistic body image remember that the photos of people you see in magazines are computer-enhanced. What might be “ideal” in a magazine or on a red carpet usually isn’t even real, let alone an ideal you should strive for.

, As a teenager, you have many choices to make during any given day. You decide what to say to your family, your friends and to your teacher or coach. You also get to choose what to do to entertain yourself and keep busy while you’re not in class or studying.


Whether you decide to participate in the chess club, cheerleading, sports or student government, each has the potential to create fulfillment in your life. For example, participating in a sport can foster friendship, teamwork, healthy competition, goal setting and achieving, and recognition.The opposite is true. If you decide to cut class, treat people with disrespect and refuse to follow the rules designed to help you, negative effects will pile up and create horrible things in your life. For example, each time you get in trouble it decreases your freedom, which can ultimately result in being sent to a correctional facility and leave you with less education and lower wages once you get a job.Every decision matters.
Whether you realize it or not, you do have a lot of power in your life. Use it to create positive things for yourself and others. This will lead to more freedom to do the things you want to do. Taking credit for all your hard work is proof of the power you have in your life.
Everyone is bound to get in trouble for something they’ve done. You can usually find a way to work your way back into the good graces of the person you may have hurt. For example, if you say something in class about someone and the entire class laughs, which makes the person cry, you can apologize right on the spot or later in private and say, “I am so sorry ____. I didn’t realize the entire class was going to do that. I’m sorry if that hurt your feelings. It won’t happen again.”

, When you are young, you experience many things for the first time. Negative feelings arise when you think you are the only one that has ever experienced the thoughts and feelings you are having. Until you connect with someone else who has had the same experience, you might feel odd and lonely.As you age you learn to draw upon your many experiences to solve problems.


Ask others for help who have experienced similar things. For example, if you are lonely and worry about making friends at school, ask a friend or family member or teacher, “What is the best way for me to make friends? Do you have any ideas?”
Approaching each situation with the attitude that others experience the same struggles, will help you focus on the task at hand rather than worry about being the only one struggling. You will get more accomplished.

, Growing pains are common to the human experience. The teen years are wracked with physical, social and psychological changes.It is part of life. Some years are tougher than others. By all accounts, the teen years are difficult in many ways. They have been studied extensively. Therefore, effective solutions are available to you if you need them.


For example, if you have a problem with acne, read online reviews about successful products and purchase them. You aren't stuck with it.
Approach your struggles as a problem to be solved, which will require you to learn and practice your problem solving skills.If you are attending a new school and feel like you don’t fit in, don’t wait for something to happen. Instead, join on-campus clubs. People join clubs because they share similar interests. This is a great starting point for building meaningful friendships., You have a vested interest in making your life meaningful. The actions you take to develop your potential will result in consequences that build knowledge, feelings of self-worth and esteem. Activity creates more activity, so your full participation is required.


Show your bravery by seizing new opportunities as if you already knew the outcome would be awesome. For example, if someone asks you to join her to help the drama department clear out a storage area to make room for new instruments, accept the invitation and check out the new instruments. You might discover you have a gift for music.
If you need to keep your grades up to participate in sports or a club on campus, decline offers to participate in things that would deter you from that goal. You can say, “I’ve got some really important things to take care of, so maybe next time.”
Although you feel forced to do a lot of things, realize that following instructions and guidelines for success helps teenagers develop into awesome adults. It has been proven time and time again.Don’t fight it.

, The world of opportunities is more open to you at this time than at any other time in history. The information super-highway is filled with potential interests that are available at your fingertips. Whether you read about it, watch a video about it, or participate in person, the opportunities to discover new interests are abundant.


If you don’t have access to online resources, they are available at libraries and schools.
If you are hesitant to try new technology, ask for help. You will conquer your fear by participating, practicing and using the skills you gain.Exploring your interests doesn’t have to be expensive. There are plenty of free activities available to discover what you like to do. For example, writing and many physical activities like running are some of the cheapest things you can do.
If you are interested in gourmet foods, movie production, or traveling abroad you can learn a lot about all of them without leaving your computer station.
Any venture into something new has the potential to be an interest or something you dislike. That’s part of the fun.

, While it is important to know what you like, it is equally important to know what you dislike. Sometimes you won’t even know why you dislike something. You don’t have to explain. Everyone would rather spend time doing the things they enjoy.


If you discover that you hate shopping, then decline offers to go shopping rather than suffer through the event. Tell your friend or family member, “I’d rather not go, but you can go. Have a great time. I’m just not into shopping.”
If your friends ask you to go play paint ball and you don’t like it say, “Thanks for the invite, but I’m going to pass. I just don’t like it.”
There are going to be things you dislike doing, but you will have to do some of them anyway. Remind yourself that there are plenty of things you enjoy doing that you can do later.
Physical abilities might play into your decision.If you don’t have a lot of upper body strength you probably won’t like throwing the shot put. However, if you have strong legs you might like running or dancing. If you use a wheelchair, focus on your abilities rather than disabilities.

, The teen years are filled with experiences and things that you might initially like, and then situations change and you don’t care for them any longer. Teens as a group tend to be inconsistent in thoughts and actions.This plays a part in the process of developing your interests. You can expect your interests to change over time and throughout your life. That is what makes it exciting. You never have to stop finding new interests.


Be flexible, which means try your best to stay neutral about all possibilities until you have concrete reasons to rule them in or out.
Most people struggle with making changes in life, even when they are miserable. Rather than repeatedly complain about something you dislike, find something different to do that will stop you from complaining.
Change is the one thing in life that is constant.
If you quickly lose interest in most everything you do, you may need to talk to someone who can help you sort out your feelings. This can be a symptom of depression.

, Are you quiet, daring, confident, cheerful, grumpy, calm, generous, hardworking, or funny? These are just a few traits among a vast amount of personality traits that comprise a person’s character. These are the things that make you unique. It’s important to know how you view yourself, and how others view you.


Each person differs in the way he thinks, feels and behaves based on his personality traits. Identify places and situation where your personality fits. For example, if you are charismatic you might excel at being a class leader. If you are quiet and calm, you might be great at working on a stage crew in the drama department.
List the traits that you think are negative. Examine each one and see if you can flip a negative into a positive. For example, if you tend to be argumentative, which gets you in trouble in class, you might make a good attorney one day.

, Being a teenager is about discovering who you are and making good choices, so it takes a bit of thinking. If you know what you are good at, you will make a positive impact. The goal is to participate in activities that are enhanced by your presence and personality.


If you are diplomatic, volunteer to be the captain of the debate team, soccer team, or IT club. Others will look to you for guidance, which is an important and rewarding job.
If you love and have a talent for organizing items, groups or events, involve yourself in event planning. Everyone appreciates a well-organized event, and you will have a great time doing it.
Sharing your gifts and talents with the world will help you feel connected and appreciated.

, Your teen years can be filled with self-judgement that ignites feelings of not fitting in.The truth is you are a “normal” teen even though you feel different from others. Once you realize that you and everyone around you are in a developmental stage that is filled with changes, discoveries and struggles, the easier it will be to live your life to the fullest.


Embrace your differences. For example, if you are intrigued by anime and you feel a little nerdy, be proud of being a nerd. There are many others who share your interests.
Embrace others for their differences. If everyone was exactly like you, the world would be boring. The world if filled with people and teenagers who think, look, talk, and behave differently than you. The next time you meet someone who is different than you make an effort to find out about him. Life is richer because people have so much to offer - including you.

, It takes bravery and courage to ask for help. If you are struggling with school life, family life or life in general, contact a trusted source to talk about getting help. There are resources available to you either at school, or from a private provider such as a counselor or doctor. Talking with someone will help you sort out your struggles and develop an effective approach to handle anything.Art therapy is also available and can be extremely beneficial."

Define your own success.,
Set achievable goals for yourself.,
Allow room for failures.",How to Achieve As a Teen1," For some people, success means making money. For others it may be helping those who are less fortunate. Before you can achieve your goals, you have to decide what success looks like for you. It can be something as simple as getting all “A”s this semester, or as complex as becoming a successful lawyer. Whatever you want to achieve, start planning with the end in sight and always be ready to move the goal forward.Try making a list of you values in several areas to help you identify what you really value. For example, you may find that you do not value going to college at this point in your life, despite how much your parents may be pressuring you to do so.;
, You wouldn’t assume that you could run a marathon with a week of training, and you shouldn’t think that being successful is something that will happen overnight. Instead, think of achieving success like walking a mile. Every step gets you a little closer and every step matters. Create a daily, weekly, and monthly to do list, and do your best to complete your goals.


Make SMART plans. SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific Measurable Attainable Realistic and Timely. When you start planning to achieve your goals, make sure each step to get you there is SMART!
For instance, if you want to be a lawyer, you’ll need to go to law school, but that’s not something you are likely to achieve as a teen. Instead, set achievable goals like research into the types of law.
If you’re interested in being a veterinarian, you may want to start by observing your local vet or volunteering with an animal rescue organization., One of the most important things we learn in our teenage years is that mistakes will happen, and that it is not the end of the world. Instead of being discouraged or ashamed when you don’t succeed right away, give yourself permission to be imperfect and try again. Remember most new discoveries only happen after many failures. If you learn from your mistakes as a teen, you’ll already be on your way to being successful.The scientific method (hypothesis, test, results, and retest) is one of the most respected techniques for determining the validity of new ideas, and the entire process is based on failure.
Try achieving success through the lens of scientific method. You make your best effort at something new, gauge your level of success, make adjustments, and try again.
Be flexible with your goals and be open to changing them. As you gain more information through experience, then you may find yourself reevaluating your goals and values.

Realize that the person in authority was in your position once.,
Put a hold on defensiveness.,
Answer questions at appropriate times.,
Don't take a step back.,
Control your nervousness.,
Trust in the guidance capacity of the authority figure.,
Focus on the positive.,
Stand up to the authority figure when necessary.",How to Talk to Authority," All modern-day authority figures were kids, and people of little authority at one time, and all of them have been talked to by someone they saw as a superior or authority figure. They too have suffered the awkward conversation, and they know how you feel when talking to authority. Most will go easy on you because of this. Remember, they want to either ask you a simple question or give you some helpful advice––they don't necessarily want to scare you.


Obviously, some authority figures do use scare tactics as a means of seeking to control others. The operative word here is ""seeking""; they can only control you or frighten you if you let them. There is no need to be rude or abrasive in response but neither do you need to act like nervous Nelly. Remain calm and assertive in the face of people who try to scare you.;
, It can be easy to get defensive and to try to pass the blame or reject responsibility. Yet, defensiveness takes a lot of energy and can block you from hearing the real message. It can also make you seem guilty, even where you aren't. And ultimately, being defensive is akin to being defiant, which is circular and gets you nowhere. Be open to what is being said; you'll learn more and you'll realize that taking it personally is pointless. Rather, take it as constructive advice or a timely warning that is worth heeding. Stay calm and focus on doing or deciding better next time.

, Don't interrupt the other person with your answer before they've finished asking the question. If you do so, you will seem either suspicious or rudely overconfident about yourself. If they ask you a question that asks for information, like ""Why did you take over the meeting from Shane when we didn't plan for that?"", then look down a little for a moment, then answer politely and succinctly. Most people look down when they're thinking and this buys you time. If they ask you a question that requires you to look into past memories, look up for a moment and answer. This is where most of us look when remembering something.


Make sure you don't answer rhetorical questions (often posed by those in positions of power, for effect or as a way to think through their own thoughts), and yet be sure that you answer real questions. For instance:

If the authority figure asks something like ""What were you thinking"", don't answer. Simply look at them for a moment, showing in your expression that you know you did something wrong or lapsed in judgment.
If they ask you a question like ""What do you think you did wrong?"", then do answer. All they want to know most of the time is that you know what you did and understand the consequences.


Sometimes the authority can be rather harsh in asking these questions, causing you not to want to answer, out of fear or anxiety. Make sure you catch yourself at these questions, and answer them. But don't mistake questions that you should answer for rhetorical questions.

, Oftentimes when people talk to authority, and they ask a question, the person will take an automatic step back. This is instinctual for humans, because when we're about to be attacked, we'll automatically go back a step to try to avoid the inevitable blow. Instead of allowing your amygdala to hijack your thinking reactions, make sure you stand your ground with the authority figure. Moving back symbolizes fear and a lack of confidence, as well as a willingness to be subordinate without standing up for yourself assertively. They will digest your determination to stand your ground subconsciously, and if you do step back, they'll assume you don't have the guts to speak to them or that you're cowering with guilt or inability to accept responsibility.

, For some people, the mere sight of a uniform or the official title on a person's badge or door is enough to make them quake at the knees. Whether it's previous experiences with people in authority triggering the response, too many movies featuring cops, interviewers or high school principals, or just an overworked sense of guilt or paranoia about everything, controlling your nervousness is paramount. Try to focus on breathing deeply, drawing slow and gentle breaths direct from your diaphragm. This will reduce your edginess and give you time to focus, as well as relaxing you. Take everything slowly, even if the authority figure appears to want immediacy in responsiveness.


For more ideas, read How to deal with being nervous and How to avoid looking nervous.

, If you're in a situation where the authority figure is calling out your behavior or attitude issues, see this as a learning opportunity. Most people in authority are in a position to see things that you aren't and they are trying, in their own way, to guide you and to keep you from repeating avoidable mistakes or pointless exercises. The authority figure is qualified to impart wisdom or expertise, so trust that responsibility as a source of guidance or even as a warning that can help improve your future approaches or thinking. Ultimately, this is about realizing that this person is usually on your side and they care enough to want to set you straight.


See this as aiming for a common goal. The authority figure can see where you went or are going wrong and has solutions to suggest for setting things right again. You are in the position of choosing to act on the soundness of their advice or warning to change your direction for the better.

, Accept that your boss, teacher, mentor, whoever has a point but rather than seeking to diffuse blame or make awkward excuses, focus on what you can do to improve the situation from this point on. This will show the authority figure that you're stepping up to their challenge or accepting their points and that you're finding solutions. For example:


Betty's boss complained that Betty has a bad habit of taking control of meetings that have nothing to do with her, the consequences of which include confused clients and angry coworkers. Betty acknowledges her enthusiasm and says that she will continue to remain enthusiastic but in future channel it all into the projects that are hers only and will only say her piece in meetings led by other coworkers if they've asked her to do so or if she has asked them if it's okay to add her piece beforehand. Her boss is reassured and Betty discovers that focusing more on her own work is even more rewarding than trying to meddle in everyone else's.
George's school principal has complained that George has been carving his name into too many school trees. George says that he accepts that he has done the wrong thing and that he will channel his artistic bent into woodcarving classes in future and that to make up for the trees he accidentally ring barked, he'll plant 40 new trees free of charge in the school grounds. George discovers as a result that he's a brilliant woodcarver and that he loves gardening too.

, This step isn't relevant unless you're being pushed around in a serious situation, in particular one where you could lose privileges, a job or even your freedom if you are in real trouble. If your boss blames you for something you didn't do, and continuously harangues you with questions, stand up to him or her. Clearly state, ""I didn't do that. I honestly don't know what you're talking about, because I didn't do what you claim, and I never would."" They will admire you for being able to stand up to them and say that. If you know who did it, and are taking the blame so they don't get in trouble, tell them who did it. If you don't, you'll just have to keep that reputation with the authority figure. Don't consider that you're ""ratting your buddy out"", because you aren't. You are simply telling the truth, since you're lying if you don't tell them who did it. You are teaching them a lesson; that you have to take responsibility for your actions.


Don't say the wrong thing. Many people make the wrong comment while standing up to authority, and end up getting into more trouble. For instance, if you're being blamed for spray painting a building or for cooking the books, don't speak out if you know it's true. If the officer says something like, ""We're going to need to take you to the station, just for some questioning"", don't blurt out, ""That's not fair, you can't arrest me! I did it with my friends/coworkers, it was all their idea!"" Although they would have appreciated the information you supplied, this is the wrong time to explain yourself. Most of the time when getting blamed for something like this, they will ask you if anyone else was involved. That would be the time to disclose this information. And if you do explain that you weren't the only one, don't shove all the blame on someone else. You both did it together as a whole, the idea belonged to both of you. That means that both of you need to take the blame.
Accept the blame, and offer to do what's necessary to make amends if you are at fault for something. Always take the blame or accept responsibility if it was you who did something wrong or you who make a poor judgment call. You need to take responsibility for your actions, and you can't do that by avoiding your punishment. If you've taken the blame, offer to do what else is necessary to gain the authority's trust again. Remember to keep your promises. Hand your papers in a few days earlier than necessary, supply the donuts for work meetings, etc. But be aware that even after you do these things, they will most likely never trust you like they once did. You'll just have to live with that and keep proving you've changed by being your better self.

Be sure to talk in a low voice, especially if you are in an area where others can potentially walk by and hear.


Reduce distractions as much as possible. Try to select an area that is quiet where you won’t be distracted by the television, radio or other electronic devices. Also, be sure to avoid doing other things like texting or looking through your wallet while the person is talking.
An alternative to sitting in a private area would be a “walk and talk.”Instead of sitting in one place, you and the other person could go for a leisurely stroll as you talk. This often allows the person to feel more comfortable discussing her problems.
Active listening can also be accomplished over the telephone. However, it is important that you have the conversation when there aren’t a lot of distractions.;
, You can ask the person about what happened or how she’s feeling. The key here is to assure her that you’re there to listen. It’s important that the person feels like you are truly interested in hearing what she has to say and that you really want to support her.


Use open-ended questions to help guide the conversation and stir discussion. Good open ended questions will give you a glimpse into what the person is thinkingYour questions should start with words like “How” and “Why” and should evoke discussion rather than one word responses.
Some examples of open-ended questions are: “What happened?” “What will you do next?” “How did that make you feel?”

, Look at the person as she speaks to you and give her your undivided attention. Having your undivided attention will help her feel more valued.


Making eye contact is important so that the person knows that you are listening to her. However, make sure the eye contact isn’t excessive. Be careful that you don’t end up staring.
Use open body language and other nonverbal cues to show her that you’re listening.Try nodding occasionally and smiling when appropriate. Also, be sure that you do not cross your arms because this reflects defensiveness and the person may not respond well to that posture.

, Demonstrating empathy is a key component to helping someone feel supported. To reflect more empathy, it is important that you clearly understand what the person is trying to communicate. Acknowledging and reflecting back to her what she is saying is a great way to make sure that you understand. She’ll also feel more supported and better understood.


Don’t just repeat back to her the exact same sentence that she states in a robotic fashion. Use paraphrasing to be more conversational in your approach. Just be sure that as you restate what the person is saying, you are using her words.You could say things like “It sounds like you are saying…” or “What I’m hearing is…” or other similar statements. This helps the person to know that you really are listening.
Don’t interrupt the person when she is talking. Instead, show support by allowing her the opportunity to express what she is thinking and feeling without interruption. Only reflect back what she is saying when there is a natural silence in the conversation or when it’s clear that she’s waiting for feedback.
This is not the time to pass judgment or be critical.Listening and showing empathy does not mean that you necessarily agree with what the person is saying; rather it is reflecting that you care about her and what she is experiencing. Avoid saying “I told you so,” “It’s really not that big of a deal,” “It can’t be that bad,” “You’re blowing it out of proportion” or other critical or minimizing comments. Your job during this time is simply to show support and empathy.

, Some people struggle to put a label on their emotions or may even try to mask their feelings. This happens often when other people have criticized their emotional sensitivity in the past. Others may be confused about what they’re feeling. For example, someone may confuse frustration with anger or happiness with excitement. Helping the person identify what she is actually feeling is the first step to validation.


Don’t tell the person how she is feeling. Instead, provide suggestions. You could say “It sounds like you’re feeling pretty disappointed” or “You seem pretty upset”
Observe the person’s body language and facial expressions as she speaks. Also, her tone may give you an idea of how she is feeling.
Remember, if you guess wrong, she will correct you. Do not dismiss her correction. Accept that she is the only person who truly knows how she is feeling. Accepting her correction is also validation of her emotions.

, This means putting aside your own thoughts or preconceived notions about the situation. Really be present and pay attention to what she is saying. Your agenda should not be to fix the problem or find the solutions. Instead, focus on providing a safe space where the person will feel heard.


Avoid trying to offer advice unless you are asked. Trying to give advice may make the person feel like you’re being critical and invalidating.
Do not try to talk the person out of feeling a certain way. Remember, she has a right to feel how she is feeling. Demonstrating emotional support means acceptance of her right to experience her emotions, whatever they are.

, It’s important that the person feels safe expressing her feelings. This is not the time to be critical of the person or the situation. Your goal is to make her feel supported and understood. Simple brief statements are best. Here are some examples of validating statements:


“That’s a lot to deal with.”
“I’m sorry that this is happening.”
“It sounds like that really hurt you.”
“I understand.”
“That would make me angry too.”

, Most communication is done in a nonverbal manner. This means that your body language is just as important as your verbal language. Make sure your body language reflects that you are paying attention and are demonstrating empathy and not criticism or rejection.


Try to nod, smile, and make eye contact as you’re listening. Research has shown that people who demonstrate these nonverbal behaviors are often rated as more empathetic by observers.Smiling is especially helpful because the human brain is prewired to recognize smiles. This means that not only will she feel more supported but both the giver and receiver of a smile often feel better quicker., If the person feels that she needs more emotional support, it’s likely that something is imbalanced in her life. This is a great opportunity to help her explore what actions she can take to become emotionally centered again.


The person may not have the answer immediately and that’s okay. Don’t push for a decision right away. She may just need to be heard and feel validated first.
Ask “what-if” questions. “What-if” questions will help the person brainstorm possible action steps that she may not have considered before.Presenting options in a question format is less threatening and the person probably won’t feel like she is being told what to do. This approach allows you to give her suggestions in a supportive manner without stripping away her power.
Remember, you are not fixing the problem for the person. You are simply providing her support in finding the solution to the problem herself.
For example, if your friend is struggling financially, you could ask, “What if you and your supervisor had a discussion about a pay raise?” Maybe your niece is feeling overwhelmed with work and home responsibilities. You could ask, “What if you planned a stress-free vacation for your family?” Any appropriate “what-if” question could be helpful.

, The person may not have all of the answers immediately, but it’s important to support her in taking small steps to resolve the problem.Identifying the next step is important, even if it’s something small like the person agreeing to have another conversation with you the next day. People tend to feel more supported when they know that they have dependable people in their corner who will help them see the bigger picture.


Continue to support the person in taking action steps until the problem is resolved. It may be a slow process but she’ll appreciate your support.
When a person is grieving, there may not be any specific action steps. People grieve differently and grief can last up to a year or longer. When you are supporting someone through grief, listening to the stories she wants to share and accepting her feelings without minimizing her loss is very important.Sometimes an action step may mean getting help from a mental health professional.

, Sometimes it can be convenient to say things like “I’m here for you if you need me” or “Don’t worry. It’s all going to work out” instead of actually doing something to help. However, it's really important to actually show your support instead of just giving lip service. After spending time actively listening to the person, you’ll probably have some idea about specific things that you could do to help her feel more supported. If you’re stuck, here are some guidelines to get your thoughts rolling:Rather than saying “Everything will be fine” you could do everything in your power to help make things better for the person. For example, you could help a sick friend find a good medical specialist or help her research treatment options.
In addition to saying “I love you” you could do something for the person that you know she’ll appreciate. This could include buying her a gift, spending more time with her, or taking her somewhere special to help her de-stress.
Instead of just saying “I’m here for you” you could bring the person dinner or help with tasks that she needs to do in order to accomplish the action steps.

, Everyone has a schedule and things get hectic sometimes, but it’s important to make time to help the person. She has probably received a lot of verbal support, but this deeper level of support would be appreciated much more. Remember, small acts of kindness really do go a long way."

Read, listen to, and act on self-improvement material.,
Consider getting a job.,
Participate in community service.,
Shadow a local professional.,
Express your creativity.,
Give yourself down time.",How to Achieve As a Teen2," As a teen, you most likely have limited knowledge about the world and about yourself as a person. It is as important to develop your inner world as much as your outer world. One good way to develop your character is through self-inquiry and by challenging yourself beyond your comfort zone. These will provide you with genuine information about the current state of your character.

Try using things like mediation and yoga to explore your inner world.
Keep in mind that there will most likely be things you will need to improve upon. You may wish to write them down in a list.
It may also help to seek out self-improvement material related to the things that you want to develop in yourself and then ACT on the information.

, Any employment position can help you be more independent because you’ll be earning your own money. This can be any job that doesn’t interfere with other parts of your daily life. You could work at the super market, gas station, fast food restaurant, or a department store. The key is to do your best work everyday and be an employee that can be relied on by your coworkers and employer.


If you dedicate yourself to doing good work, you’re much more likely to be promoted or receive a raise.
Remember your employers can provide references for you when applying for college or for other jobs., The most successful people give back to those in need, and this is a great way to learn more about your community and how to be a good leader. You don’t need to be part of a big humanitarian effort either. Start small. Call a local assisted living facility or care home to inquire about visiting, volunteer to play piano for a church choir, or start cleaning up your local cemetery on the weekends. If you want to join a larger effort, there are likely numerous organizations in your school and community that would welcome you.


Sign up to participate in a charitable fundraiser like 5 or 10 k run or marathon.
Ask your guidance counselor to recommend service organizations you can join.
Talk to your family and friends about their community involvement, and ask if you can join them., This is a great way to get a better understanding of what it’s like to be a police officer, college professor, or veterinarian. If you think you want to go into a specific field, look for someone close by who actually does your future job, and ask them if you can talk to them about what they do or observe them for a day. Most people will be happy to work with you., Many young people find success at an early stage in life by developing new and different technologies, creating beautiful art, or starting a musical career. If you have a special talent for a creative art, put in the time to hone these skills. Even if you never become a famous artist or develop the coolest new app, creative thinking is an important skill you can use in every aspect of your life. People who can think creatively find innovative ways to handle business problems, make great parents, and are the best decision makers., Taking all the advanced classes, getting a promotion at work, and giving back to your community won't matter if you’re miserable, so make sure to make time for fun. Take time for yourself and do things that you enjoy. Get a hobby, read a book, binge watch your favorite TV show. Whatever you do, remember to take a break and recharge."

Develop good relationships with your family.,
Establish meaningful friendships.,
Find a mentor.,
Schedule a meeting with the guidance counselor.,
Join sports teams, clubs, or other organizations.,
Be a leader every day.",How to Achieve As a Teen3," We learn how to socialize at an early age in the home where we are, hopefully, safe. If your relatives know they can trust you, this support from your family will help you feel more confident in the classroom and wider world. Learning to communicate clearly, establishing yourself as someone your family can rely on, and becoming a productive member of a team are all skills learned as part of a family.Start by telling your family you want to work on developing better relationships with them, so you can learn to have successful relationships in the future. Say something like, “I want to do a better job of setting and achieving goals, and I’d like to start by gaining your trust and respect. I would appreciate any feedback or advice.”
If a family member expresses unhappiness with your behavior, ask them what you could do differently to create a more positive relationship. Say something like, “I’m sorry to have upset you. I didn’t mean to. What can I do differently to avoid causing offense in the future?”
Communicating your goals with others and taking responsibility for your actions and how they affect others are both keys to achieving success at any age., Once you leave the home, your friends or classmates begin to teach you more about building lasting, respectful relationships that will help you become successful. A meaningful relationship may look different, depending on your stage of life, but for the most part, a good relationship is one that pushes both parties to be successful. Creating relationships is known as networking when it comes to achieving your goals, and the more practice you have building meaningful relationships, the better you will be at establishing meaningful partnerships and work relationships.Develop more meaningful relationships by sharing your goals with friends. Ask people you're getting to know, ""Where do you see yourself in five years?""
Follow up this initial question by asking, ""How are you planning to achieve your goal, and can I help you?""
If you want a friend to help you with your goals, ask. Communication is key, and even the best friends aren't mind readers.

, Every successful person started out as an ordinary teen like you, but they were lucky enough to have people who helped them discover their strengths and build character. Get to know your teachers, tutors, or coaches. Like building relationships with family members and friends, working with your instructors offers you yet another way to network.It’s easy to build relationships with teachers and coaches. Start by treating them with respect and showing you care about your work.
Get to know them better by finding a time (before or after class/practice) to ask some simple questions like, “What got you interested in physics?” You could also ask something more general like, “Why did you decide to become a tennis coach?”
Your widening network should always include people who have education and experience in a variety of backgrounds, so don’t just befriend the teachers in your favorite subjects. Getting to know the instructor can also make subjects you dislike seem more interesting.

, This may be the most important thing you can do to be successful as a teen. Guidance counselors are exactly what the name suggests – people who can guide you through difficult situations. When it comes to choosing classes, joining extracurricular activities, or applying to college, your guidance counselor can help you succeed.


If your school doesn’t have a guidance counselor, ask a teacher or your principal for help., Engaging in extracurricular activities shows dedication and sportsmanship. If you can keep up with these activities and your schoolwork, you’ll be setting yourself up to achieve in the future. Extracurricular activities also give you the opportunity to continue building relationships with new and different people. Additionally, these are great avenues for you to take on roles that will help you learn to work with others on future tasks.


Extracurricular activities also look good on college applications, since a student is able to learn discipline, teamwork, leadership, and other skills by participating in these groups., This doesn’t mean just to be in charge of every group or organization. It can be as simple as supporting those around you. Being a leader is all about staying calm, assessing your situation, and helping people make the right decisions. A good leader sees the strengths of each person around them, and they take the time to help others be successful.


For example, if you are a member of your school’s band and you hear another player struggling, offer to help them. Say something like, “I heard you struggling on that eight note run. Do you want to practice with me later?”
If you’re getting an A in Algebra, ask other students who are struggling to study with you. You could say, “Do you think we should have a study group before the next test?”"
"
Study diligently.,
Take challenging courses.,
Stay up to date on current events.",How to Achieve As a Teen4," Learning is the only way to gain wisdom beyond your teenage years and achieve your goals at a young age. It’s not all about grades, though a good grade will show your peers, family, and teachers that you're hardworking. Instead, actually understanding each subject you study and how it fits into the real world should be your top priority. Try to find real world experiences for the things you learn in school.


If you find yourself interested in a subject you’re studying at school, don’t stop with preparing for a quiz or test on the topic. Keep reading, ask your teacher for an extra credit assignment, or do some online research.
The subject in class you find interesting today may lead to a great career choice in the future, so talk to your guidance counselor about job possibilities. For instance, if you really enjoy studying history, you may want to consider careers in archeology, law, or conservation. All of these fields use history every day., If you can easily get all of your work done, it may be time to find classes that can offer you more mental stimulation. Being challenged to push beyond your current ability is how you’ll become successful. Make sure to find a balance and make time for relaxation.


Don’t take too many classes. This can be overwhelming. Challenge yourself, but don’t sabotage your ability to learn well.
If you can’t take more advanced courses, ask your teacher for additional assignments or set your own goals to keep learning outside of the classroom., It’s easier than ever to do this with a world of news and information at your fingertips on your computer, tablet, or smart phone. You can also read the local newspaper, watch the news each morning or evening, or consider volunteering with a local political campaign. Gaining a better understanding of what’s happening around you will allow you to not only develop your own opinions, but it will also give you the ability to know how to make a difference."

Do not brag or act superior.,
Volunteer in class.,

Do all your homework.,

Expect that people will make fun of you and be mean to you.,
Study well for tests and remain constantly prepared.",How to Act As the Smartest Kid in School," While being smart is great, modesty rules too. Others will notice your intelligence in class, whether or not they mention it. They are bound to notice if you show it. Bragging will make you disliked.;
, This will show that you know the answers without you having to brag. Offer to help others, by asking, ""Do you need help?"", especially if you see that someone is stuck on something. You can help anyone-this does not need to be only a friend. Others may only help friends, but this is because they are not as smart as you are.

, You can offer them to others, or simply leave them out in class. People are bound to notice and ask for them. Make your offer now. A study guide can be like practice problems, or simply a list of vocabulary, for example.

, Your integrity will make you very well-known. Your teachers are bound to like you. Go the extra mile; do more than asked for. Write five paragraphs instead of one. Show your work in math. Use proper grammar in Spanish even if you are not required to. Take notes in science. Soon, a teacher might use you as an example.

, Being smart does not mean being ""nerdish"". Of course, there's nothing wrong with being a nerd, but keep in mind you can still have fun. Most likely, if you are smart, you are fast at work and have free time. Hang out with friends after school. Your nice nature is going to attract friends. In school, talk about things other than just academics sometimes.

, There are several cases to deal with depending on the person. One type of person is an acquaintance whom you help. Help this person regardless. Don't expect friendship in return for help. Another type of person is a true friend. While it is okay to be friends with people who admire you for intelligence, know the difference. True friends are the ones who help you if you are in trouble. Someone who is using you appears to act like your friend and copies off you constantly, but when you are in trouble they join in the fun. For example, if someone makes fun of you, they join in.

, Even if you do encounter trouble, you should handle it without yelling or acting snobbish. Yelling will not do any good.

, Jealousy is the reason for it, even if it is not admitted by them. Handle them calmly and ignore them. If they continue to bother you or hit you, tell the principal or another staff member along with your parents.

, Those extra minutes of studying will save you in the end, leaving you more free time, better grades, and more respect as a smart student. People respect good looking, smart, and motivated people. You don't have to be nerdy to be smart. So as long as you study, once you get to class, you won't have to worry how others see you, it will show in the test grades.

Do this by making a list of things that brought you joy when you were young. Explore these lovely memories and try to recall that childhood wonder.Revisiting these activities is also a good idea. Some ideas:


Sports, whether that's soccer, football, basketball, baseball, or something else.
Exploring the woods. A yummy picnic is a great idea.
Playing pretend. This can be dressing up and having a tea party or even fighting off a band of mean, sneaky pirates.
Color, whether in a child's or adult coloring book.
Indulge in a favorite childhood treat, whether it is a favorite cereal, something your mom would make you, or a treat.;
, Although everyone has different childhoods, there are patterns common to most people. If the relationship with your inner child has dwindled over the years, try to identify what stage of development your childhood is in now. This will help you create a roadmap for bringing your inner child back into your life. Note that there are some common themes one's ""inner child"" can have. These examples tend to be what your inner child is ""mostly"". Some examples are:


The abandoned child. This inner child often comes about as a result of parents divorcing or being too busy to spare attention. Or it can be severe, in the cases of abuse or neglect. Some of the clues are fears of being abandoned and feeling lonely or insecure.
The playful child. This child is a healthy, often neglected aspect of adulthood. The playful child wants to have spontaneous fun and live free from guilt or anxiety.
The fearful child. This child probably received a lot of criticism as a child and experiences anxiety whenever it fails get enough affirmation.

, This can be an apology if you feel like you've neglected your inner child and want to repair that connection. It can also be a simple letter expressing your desire to strengthen the friendship.


Tailor your letter to the type of inner child you have. If she is fearful, try to reassure her and soften those fears. If she's worried about being abandoned, let her know that you will do your best always to be there for her. If she is playful, tell her you want to honor that lighthearted freedom.

, Your inner child is a vulnerable person. She may need a safe space before she shows herself. Many people hide or deny the existence of the inner child because they think it makes them look weak.To let your inner child shine through, be gentle and affirming. Approach her softly, like a small animal whose trust you want to gain.


Sit quietly and tell your inner child that you want to know more about her, that you're available to talk, and that you want her to feel safe. This may sound silly, but what you're doing is accessing another part of yourself and your unconscious mind.

, One important way to get in touch with your inner child is to pay close attention to feelings that pop up in your daily life. These can be traced back to many of the wonderful and painful experiences of childhood when you were young and impressionable. The inner child's fears and insecurities, as well as her joys and feelings of wonder, often unfold into the emotional patterns of our adult lives.


Throughout the day, check in with yourself. Ask, ""what am I feeling right now?"" Try to put words to these feelings.

, One of the biggest obstacles to giving your inner child the attention and care she needs is a critical voice. This voice can tell you that you're too old to have childlike insecurities or embrace the silliness of childhood.


The inner critic begins to develop in childhood; it's a reaction to the inner child being stifled.Respect your inner critic as part of your inner child who has been let down or hurt but avoid buying into negative self-talk.
Respond to your inner critic by saying ""I understand where you're coming from. I understand that you're hurt. I'm here for you.""
Another helpful phrases: ""Yes, this is a little silly. But this is what I'm supposed to be doing right now. Can you please take a break and let me do this?""

, You may be tempted to push your inner child away because her problems seem irrelevant to your life as an adult. This isn't true, however, since many of our deepest feelings are carried forward by the inner child. Avoid the temptation of disregarding or ignoring your inner child. She can't be sidestepped.Listen to her like you would an actual child in front of you. She's just as real and her feelings matter just as much.

, You may experience frustration if feelings of anger or insecurity well up inside you. It's important to let yourself feel this energy, however, because this is the inner child speaking to you.


She may throw a tantrum or get sorrowful. You can accept these emotions without ""giving in"" to them. Acknowledge them and then move on without letting them dictate your actions.

, Re-parenting is based on the idea that as an adult you now possess the knowledge and resources to give your inner child what she needs.If you feel like your inner child needs some healing before she can show up in your life at her best, this can be a good approach to try. You know better than anyone what she needs, based on hurtful experiences in her past, and how to help.


For example, if your parents never gave you a birthday party, throw one for yourself. Invite your friends and tell them you're making up for this part of your childhood.
For another example, affirm yourself when you know you've done something you can be proud of. Say ""I'm proud of myself and my achievements."", Although you want to avoid being held back by childhood fears, it's a good idea to be sensitive to your inner child's needs as well. If you have particular insecurities that you haven't fully overcome, respect them. You may have a fear of heights that first showed up in childhood. Be kind to the part of you that's still unsure about high diving boards or climbing.


Also, stay out of toxic situations. If being around specific people reinforces childhood anxieties, limit contact with those individuals. For example, if you have a brother who picks on you and makes you feel bad about yourself, avoid spending more time with him than necessary.

, Make your home more open to the playfulness of childhood.Changing your environment will change the way you feel, so inject some childlike spontaneity and creativity into your life. Research shows that things as simple as different hues can affect mood.Place familiar objects like trophies or stuffed animals on your mantle. Dig up old pictures of you and your family to put around the house. Try sprucing up the color of your walls, either by painting them or hanging light-hearted artwork.

, If you have children or nieces/nephews, get them to play with you. Getting your adult friends involved can also be fun. There's a whole psychology behind hide and seek that says it's a life-affirming game of exploration and being loved., You could even rent a bouncy house for a day and invite all of your friends. The physical activity will help you burn off stress, and the experience will remind you of how much you enjoyed bouncing as a child., These activities will help you tap into your childhood creativity, where objects you draw aren't just things on a page, but open up entire emotional worlds. Research suggests that drawing helps children express their emotions, which they aren't aware of yet in the same way than adults can be.Drawing and other visual arts can help your inner child express herself.

, Dancing can help you burn off stress like other physical activity, and it's also a creative avenue of expression that spans different age groups. Everyone loves to dance, from childhood all the way to old age. Use dance to connect with your inner child in a way that also honors your adulthood desires and interests.


Make sure to include songs from your childhood in the playlist!

, This involves letting your conscious mind rest while other parts of yourself take over. It can be a powerful source of creativity and fun, especially if you set the intention of letting your inner child express herself as she sees fit.


Use crayons, colored pencils, or colored paper to make things more fun.

Shower every day.,
Shave.,
Wear deodorant or antiperspirant every day.,
Wear clean clothes.,
Wash your hair whenever you feel that it's necessary.,
Trim your nails.,
Take care of your face.",How to Be a Hygienic Teenage Girl," Showering keeps you clean and fresh smelling, so even if you don't feel like it, remember to shower every day!;
, You should shave whenever you think it's time to. Use shaving cream or soap - never try to shave without shaving cream or soap, as it can lead to irritation, nicks, and little red bumps, which you don't want.

, You can also wear perfume - this is optional but a good idea. If you have asthma, try wearing some scented deodorant.

, There is no point to being hygienic if you have dirty clothes - it'll just make you stink and look unkempt.

, Washing your hair every day will strip your hair and scalp of the natural oils it needs to stay hydrated. Use shampoo made especially for your hair type, and never skip conditioner! You can also straighten or curl if you want.

, Do not bite or lick at your nails! Nail polish is optional, but try not to paint your nails more than twice a month, as this can lead to the yellowing and weakening of your nails.

,


You will need a cleanser recommended for your skin type. Put a small amount of face cleanser on your hands, about the size of a nickel, and rub some on your wet hands. Use a product that is gentle enough for your skin, because something that's too strong will just dry the skin out and stimulate the oil glands to produce more oil - you're trying to remove oil and retain moisture at the same time. Do not use soap - it's too strong, and can't be rinsed easily.
Using your fingertips, massage the cleanser all over your face, removing any dirt and oil. Take thirty seconds or so, concentrating on first the hairline, then paying special attention to the ""T-zone"" (forehead, nose, and nostril area), then around the mouth and chin, then cheeks. Cleanse the neck using upward strokes. You have oil glands behind your ears, so don't neglect that area. It's messy, but do it anyway. When you're fifty, you will be glad you went to the trouble to help your mature skin look its best! Rinse your face with warm water and pat it dry with a soft towel.
Moisturizer is a very good thing. You have just washed off dirt and oil, and a moisturizer will help keep the moisture in the surface cells, which promotes a more youthful looking complexion - plus it feels great!

Buy flowing shirts.,
Shop for patterned tops.,
Layer your clothing.,
Wear oversized hoodies and sweatshirts.,
Choose breathable fabrics.",How to Cover up a Boston Brace for Girls1," Tight clothing will make the brace more noticeable. To cover the brace, buy larger shirts and dresses that will show fewer of the details of the brace through the fabric.Baby doll t-shirts are perfect, as they're very loose and cover up the brace.
Tunic tops paired with leggings are a good choice because the top will flow over the brace instead of clinging to it.
Empire waist tops and shift dresses are also good choices because they give plenty of space around your torso.;
, Patterns can hide the details of the brace by drawing the eye to the pattern itself rather than what's underneath. Some good patterns for this include floral, stripes, plaid, or polka dots.

, Layering is a great technique for covering up a brace. Wear a T-shirt or tank top as the bottom layer. For the top layer try cardigans, blazers, or jackets, depending on the weather. When you layer your tops, choose an undershirt in a similar color to your brace so it blends in. Avoid contrasting colors that won't show as well under other tops.

, For casual days, loungewear, or workouts, oversized hoodies or sweatshirts are great choices because they are comfortable and will hide your brace well. Pair them with fitted pants or jeans for a polished look and to balance out the oversized top.

, If you live in a warm climate, wearing a brace under your clothes can make you uncomfortably hot and sweaty. Buy clothing made of cotton or a cotton-blend, so you can stay cool."

Arrange accommodations at school.,
Ask your parents to speak to your teacher.,
Find alternatives to writing notes.,
Stretch throughout the day.,
Gain extra time to go to class.,
Ask your friends for help.,
Explain your disease.",How to Cope With Juvenile Arthritis in Teens1," Your parents will need to speak to the school administration to explain your condition. The school should work with you to help you in the classroom. You may need a note from your doctor to confirm your condition, so plan ahead. You might have to remind the school that under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, they are required to accommodate your needs so that you can do your best.You may also need to speak with the school nurse and arrange to go to the nurse's office if you need to take medication during the day.;
, While your school may inform your teacher of your needs, there is a chance that your teacher will be unfamiliar with your condition. Your parents may need to have a separate conference during which they discuss your condition with your teacher. This conference can also ease any difficulties you may be having with your teacher.Having specific details and being able to name your medications can be helpful. The more information you can give, the more people are likely to assist you. ""Dr. Smith has diagnosed me as having polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and has prescribed this list of medications,"" sounds better than, ""Oh yeah, I've got arthritis.""

, If you have problems in your hands, you may find it difficult to take notes during class. Instead of forcing yourself to painfully write things down, you can ask for accommodation.You can:


See if the school will provide you an aide in class.
Ask if you can borrow notes from another student.
Get permission to record your teacher's lectures.

, Explain to your teachers that your condition may worsen unless you are allowed to stretch.Ask them for breaks throughout class for this purpose. Perhaps they will let you stretch for the first or last five minutes of class, or maybe they will let you stand up from your chair halfway through.

, Your arthritis may cause you to walk slowly through the hallways. Instead of pushing your body and potentially injuring yourself, you should inform your teacher that you need extra time between classes. They may let you leave a few minutes early, or they may excuse you if you arrive late.

, Explain your condition to your friends, and ask them if they would be willing to help you with small tasks throughout the day. Let them know that these won’t be significant or take up much time. If they agree, inform your teacher that they are assisting you, and your teacher may forgive them if they come to class late with you. You might ask:


“Can you help me carry my books between classes? When my hands get stiff, I tend to drop them.”
“Do you mind if I borrow your notes? With my arthritis, I can’t write fast enough to keep up.”
“Can we talk sometime? I’ve been feeling down lately, and I need to speak to someone I trust.”, When people ask you in the halls why you walk so slowly, just say, ""My joints have matured early,"" or use another witty response. If they continue to ask questions, try to answer them the best you can. Students may not be trying to be rude, and this is a good time to teach your peers about your condition.


You can say, ""I have juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It's a disease in which my immune system attacks my joints by accident. It can be pretty painful sometimes, but I'm managing it.""

One of the easiest ways to get relief is to take a hot shower or bath. The heat can help relieve any pain while loosening your joints.If you don't respond well to heat, you may find that cold packs work as well. While less common, some people's arthritis is better treated with cold than with heat., Moderate pressure massages can help relieve pain and stiffness, especially if you have rheumatoid arthritis.Let your massage therapist know that you have arthritis, and tell them which joints are affected. Hot stone and Swedish massages with a moderate or light touch are preferable. A strong deep tissue massage may not help you., Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most common forms of arthritis relief. NSAIDs include common over-the-counter remedies such as aspirin and ibuprofen. If your condition is severe, you may want to ask your doctor about a more powerful treatment, such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or corticosteroids and other immune suppressants., Exercise can help relieve your symptoms, although you will have to do the right types of activity. If you play sports, work with the coach to try to cut out exercises that put stress on joints. Perhaps they can suggest different exercises.


Swimming and bike riding are great ways to exercise without stressing your joints.
If your arthritis is managed well, you may be able to play soccer or basketball.
Do not do activities that place stress on your joints, such as jumping on a trampoline., Stretching can help prevent your joints and muscles from shortening, and it will keep you more flexible in the long run. Frequent stretches throughout the day can help you stay limber, even if you have been sitting all day. You should try stretching when your pain is at its lowest. You can even do sitting stretches while working at your school desk., While there is mixed evidence about the relationship between food and arthritis, some foods may be able to reduce your inflammation.This means that you will feel less pain and stiffness overall. Avoid red meats, full-fat dairy, and fried or processed food. Some good foods include:Fish
Oranges
Bell peppers
Food rich in, or fortified with, vitamin D and calcium, such as some dairy products

Smile and stay positive.",How to Cope With Juvenile Arthritis in Teens3," If you are being bullied by other teenagers, you should try to ignore their taunts. Instead of getting defensive, try to explain your illness. If you refuse to become upset, they may become bored and stop their taunting.


If you can joke about your condition, you may be able to deflect bullying.For example, if someone says that you walk like an old person, tell them “Well, duh. That’s because I’ve got old joints.”
If bullying is severe, note when and where it happened. Let both your teacher and your parents know. Schools are required to handle cases of bullying when the student is being harassed due to a medical condition., Try to go to conventions or ask your doctors about ways to meet other teens with arthritis. This will help prevent you feeling misunderstood.You may also find a local support group, such as your local chapter of the Arthritis Foundation.These groups will provide you venues to discuss your social and physical struggles of having juvenile arthritis.


Some organizations have camps for kids and teens with arthritis, which can be a great way to meet new friends who can relate to your challenges.

, Don't bundle up pain and emotions inside. You should remember your arthritis is not your fault, and it is alright to feel angry, sad, or frustrated with your disease.There are many ways that you can express and manage your emotions in a healthy way.


Write in a journal.Vent to close friends .
Talk to your school psychologist or a therapist.

, Don't let your arthritis control your life. Make sure people know you as more than just ""the kid with arthritis."" You can still be a girly-girl, rocker, punk, or jock. Arthritis is a medical condition, and you can still express your personality in whatever way that you want.

, If you have to use braces or other devices during the day, you may feel as though your style is defined by your illness. It is easy to find clothing that is both easy for you to put on while still looking good.


Instead of dealing with buttons, try putting on a pullover sweater. These will be easy for you to take on and off. Plus they come in a range of styles. You can choose one with your favorite band, a funny saying, or a bright print.You can still buy cute shoes, as long as they are flat and provide good support.You might want to put inserts in them to help with arthritis in lower extremities.

Be aware that you are getting angry.,
Identify the physical manifestations of anger.,
Identify the emotional manifestations of anger.,
Identify changes in your behavioral pattern.,
Ask questions of your anger.,
Examine the possibility of control issues.,
Examine the possibility of other mental health disorders.,
Understand that your environment is influential.,
Gain some perspective.",How to Cope With Anger1," For many people dealing with anger issues, the fact that they are too quick to become angry or express themselves with anger in situations that do not call for it is often lost on the individual. So, it can be useful to listen to others' opinions of your behavior, as it is often easier for someone else to identify when you are getting angry than it is gauge your own manifestations of anger. The first step in addressing an anger issue is to realize that you have one., Anger manifests itself in many ways, but is also accompanied by a handful of physical changes in your body that can help you know when you are getting angry. Some physical signs of anger are:


An increase in blood pressure and pulse.
General redness in the face, or a hot feeling in the neck/face area.
Clenching your jaws or grinding your teeth.
The rapid onset of a headache or stomach ache.
An increase in sweating, especially your palms.
Shaking or trembling.
Dizziness., Emotional markers also indicate the onset of anger in an individual. Some of the emotional signs to watch for are:


Feeling like you want to get away from the situation.
Feeling irritated, sad or depressed.
Feeling guilty, resentful or anxious.
Feeling like you may need to lash out verbally or physically., Anger is accompanied by a handful of changes in one's behavioral patterns as well. Some behavioral changes to watch out for are:


Rubbing your head excessively.
Cupping your fist with your other hand.
Pacing.
Engaging in mean-spirited sarcasm.
A sudden loss of your sense of humor
Acting in an openly abusive or abrasive manner.
Craving a drink, a smoke or other substance that relaxes you.
A sudden raising of your voice or beginning to yell, scream, or cry., As anger is often a first response to any stressful situation for people with anger management problems, it is often useful for you to ask yourself, “Why am I angry?” Many times you will find that a situation in which you have expressed anger as a first reaction does not call for an angry response and, when you have examined the situation carefully, you will realize that anger is not helping the situation or providing any real solution., Many times, people with anger management issues do not actually have a problem with anger, but rather a lack of control. It is undeniably stressful to have to cope with a situation over which you have little to no control. However, angry reactions will not change the level of influence you have on a situation and, more often than not, can exacerbate the stress-levels that are incumbent with such situations- leading to greater levels of anger., Overwhelming feelings of anger in situations that do not call for it can often be signs of an underlying psychological or psychiatric disorder. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dissociative identity disorder are but a few psychological conditions that can lead one to react with anger. These conditions can be managed with medical or professional help and are cause to see doctor or therapist.It is important to note that these conditions are relatively rare, affecting only about 43 million people in the United States, or about 18% of the total population. While considering the possibility of a mental disorder is relevant to controlling your anger, it is far more likely that you have anger management problems rather than a psychiatric disorder.Also keep in mind that associative identity disorder and schizophrenia usually manifest themselves in far more severe ways than simple outbursts of anger.

, Your anger management issues may be a result of your environment. However, before you can remove yourself from situations that make you angry, you need to be aware of the environmental factors that trigger your anger and know that others’ responses to your anger can often lead to you becoming even angrier., Once you realize that you have an anger management issue, look back on situations where you have responded to stress with anger. Did becoming outwardly angry relieve your stress? Did responding with anger alleviate the actual source of or fix the issue that was making you angry? For well-balanced and grounded individuals, the answers to these questions are usually “No.” Stepping back for a moment and gaining some perspective should allow you to see that your anger solved nothing. It was not successful in relieving you of your stressful feelings and the situation that made you angry in the first place is rarely resolved with anger. With this being the case, you may be able to substitute another reaction for the anger you are used to conveying."

Find out about thyroid replacement therapy.",How to Balance Hormones," Each hormone is responsible for the completion of certain tasks in the female body. Knowing what each hormone does will help you determine which hormone is lacking based on which bodily functions are not working properly.


Estrogen: This is the primary female sex hormone. In women, it accelerates metabolism, increases fat stores, reduces muscle mass, helps form secondary sex characteristics, increases the sex drive, and promotes the increased growth and formation of the uterus.

Estrogen deficiency can cause irregular menstruation, lack of menstruation, mood swings, lack of sexual desire, an inability to become pregnant, and early menopause.


Progesterone: Commonly considered to be the ""pregnancy hormone,"" it is responsible for preparing the uterus for implantation and decreasing the immune response so that the body can accept a pregnancy. A decrease in progesterone after pregnancy is thought to help trigger labor and milk production.

Progesterone deficiency is primarily identified by heavy, irregular periods and difficulty maintaining a pregnancy. Weight gain in the mid-section, severe premenstrual symptoms, and severe fatigue may also occur.


Testosterone: Known as the primary male sex hormone, it is also present in the female body. In women, it contributes to the libido and is responsible for many of the changes women go through during puberty, including acne, subtle changes to the vocal range, and the completion of the growth cycle.

Testosterone deficiency in women is most commonly identified by a lack of libido, physical inability to become aroused, abnormally dry skin, and increasingly brittle hair.


Prolactin: Though it has a wide range of effects, but it is the primary hormone responsible for stimulating the mammary glands in order to trigger lactation. The hormone also aids the development of the fetus when a woman is pregnant and counteracts and concludes arousal.

Prolactin deficiency is characterized by inadequate lactation, menstrual disorders, delayed puberty, hair loss, and fatigue. It is most commonly diagnosed after a woman gives birth, especially if excessive bleeding is noticed during delivery.

;
, Some of the female reproductive hormones can be balanced simply by taking over-the-counter supplements.


Estrogen and progesterone supplements are available without a prescription in both cream and pill form.
There are no prolactin supplements, but women who suffer from prolactin excess often take estrogen supplements or prolactin inhibitors to remedy the problem.
There are no over-the-counter testosterone supplements that are safe for women to use. Testosterone pills made for men are too strong for women.

, In general, maintaining a balanced diet will also help you maintain balanced hormone levels, but there are a few specific dietary changes that can improve your hormone levels even more.


Zinc is known to aid in the production of testosterone. Foods high in zinc include dark chocolate, peanuts, and many meats, including beef, veal, lamb, crab, and oysters.
Eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats create healthy cell membranes, allowing hormones to reach their destinations within the body. Good foods to include are walnuts, eggs, and many types of fish, including sardines, trout, salmon, tuna, and oysters.
Get more fiber into your diet. High-fiber foods include whole grains, raw fruit, and raw vegetables. Fiber binds itself to old estrogen, clearing it out of the system and leading to better overall balance.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Studies suggest that excessive use of either product can contribute to premenstrual hormonal imbalance.

, Aerobic exercise has been known to release chemicals that improve mood, which can help balance out mood swings caused by a lack or excess of female reproductive hormones.

, Stress causes excess cortisol to be produced, which blocks out estrogen. In women, a loss of estrogen also causes lower amounts of serotonin, which is often linked to mood disorders.

, If natural remedies do not prove effective, you may need to regulate your hormone levels through the use of prescription medications or hormone replacement therapy.


Start on an oral contraceptive.Birth control does more than simply halt reproduction. The pills contain synthetic hormones that are capable of balancing out high levels of estrogen and low levels of progesterone.
Ask your doctor about anti-depressants. Most antidepressants work by balancing out serotonin levels, which drop in response to low estrogen levels. Some have also proved moderately effective in reducing hot flashes in hormonally-imbalanced, menopausal women.Go on menopausal hormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy is the prescription equivalent of over-the-counter hormone supplements. Menopausal women are occasionally treated with doses of estrogen, progesterone, or a progestin-estrogen combination., Understanding the hormones involved in the male reproductive system will help you to gauge which hormones you might be deficient in.


Testosterone: Considered the primary male sex hormone, it is responsible for the growth of muscle mass, maturation of the male sex organs, maturation of male secondary sex characteristics, completion of growth, development of sperm, and strength of the libido.

Testosterone deficiency is most immediately recognized by a decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and shrinking testes. Other signs can include hot flushes, decreased energy, depressed mood, lack of concentration, insomnia, and loss of strength.


DHT, or dihydrotestosterone: This is mostly involved in the formation and maturation of male genitalia.

DHT deficiency is often spotted in boys before and during puberty. Males who have underdeveloped external genitalia usually lack DHT. In adult males, a lack of DHT can cause infertility.


Estrogen and progesterone: Though both are considered female sex hormones, they are present in males, as well. Estrogen helps to regulate sperm maturation and libido. Progesterone balances out estrogen levels in men, preventing the male reproductive system from becoming flooded with estrogen.

Deficiencies in estrogen or progesterone can manifest themselves in similar ways. Depression and loss of libido can occur with either imbalance. Estrogen deficiency can cause a loss of bone density, excessive hair growth, or changes in skin pigmentation. Progesterone deficiency can cause hair loss, weight gain, and gynecomastia (an enlargement of the male breast).


Prolactin: Another hormone commonly attributed to women, it is also found in men. In men, it is thought to play a role in the body's immune response, but there is no indication that prolactin is vital to the male body.

Excess prolactin can prevent men from producing testosterone. Prolactin deficiency does not seem to have any definitive adverse effects, however.



, Over-the-counter hormone creams and pills can often remedy some of the most common hormone imbalances in men.


Testosterone is the male hormone most frequently supplemented without prescription. Men can find testosterone supplements in the form of pills, creams, and gels.
There are no over-the-counter treatments for DHT deficiency, but excess DHT can cause hair loss, and over-the-counter DHT blockers are available as pills and shampoos.
Over-the-counter progesterone cream for men can be used to treat progesterone deficiency and estrogen dominance. Men needing to supplement their estrogen may need a prescription treatment, however.
Prolactin inhibitors can be lowered with over-the-counter B-complex supplements.

, A balanced diet is the best way to regulate hormones in most men, and most male hormone imbalances can be aided simply by obeying the traditional standards of a healthy diet.


Eat plenty of meat and carbohydrates, which provide energy and aid in hormone production. Seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids and low-fat meats are best, as are fiber-rich grains.
Avoid sugar, caffeine, and excessive dairy, which can cause the body to becomes sluggish and to struggle with hormone production.

, A regular routine including aerobic and resistance exercise is capable of increasing testosterone production.

, In men, elevated levels of stress create more cortisol, which can convert testosterone to estrogen. The result is an over-abundance of the female sex hormone and a severe lack of the male sex hormone.

, Most testosterone is produced during the REM cycle of sleep. As such, sleeping less will cause a drop in testosterone while sleeping more can help stabilize testosterone levels.

, Loose bottoms, including both underwear and pants, are especially important. Tight bottoms can create unwanted heat, which can destroy existing sperm and ultimately reduce sperm count.

, Severe male hormone imbalance may need to be treated with prescription hormone replacement therapy.


Testosterone injections are the most common medical treatment used to balance male hormones. Doctors prescribe the injections for however long they deem necessary. The treatment is eventually tapered off, and the patient is monitored to check if testosterone levels remain balanced afterward or continue to drop. If the levels continue to drop, long-term treatments might be necessary.Males who suffer from a lack of estrogen or progesterone can also inquire about prescription hormone replacements for these imbalances since over-the-counter supplements are usually hard to come by for men.

, After working out, the body releases endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, all of which create a positive mood and help maintain the remainder of the endocrine system.


Working out also releases growth factors, including insulin.

, A well-balanced diet can impact more than simply female and male sex hormones. All of the body's hormones can benefit from a diet filled with lean meats, whole grains, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.


Know how soy can affect your thyroid. There has been some indication that a diet based in soy products can cause a decrease in production of the thyroid hormone.Those suffering from hypothyroidism, a deficiency of the thyroid hormone, should limit their intake of soy.
Balance your iodine levels. Iodine is a mineral that aids in the synthesis of the thyroid hormone. Foods with notable levels of iodine include sea vegetables, potatoes, cranberries, yogurt, strawberries, and dairy. If you have hypothyroidism, eat more iodine-rich foods. If you have hyperthyroidism, limit your iodine-rich foods.
Include moderate amounts of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can provide the body with energy, but they also increase the amount of insulin hormone the body produces. Too many carbs can lead to a dramatic rise in blood sugar levels as well as insulin.
Improve melatonin synthesis with vitamin B5. Foods rich in B5 include milk, yogurt, eggs, and fish. These foods are also high in tryptophan, which converts serotonin into melatonin.

, Melatonin is the ""sleep"" hormone, and it impacts the sleep cycle as much as the sleep cycle impacts it.


Avoid bright lights when sleeping. Light can inhibit melatonin production, which occurs in the dark, making it harder to sleep.
Give your body sleeping cues. A consistent bedtime and a bedtime ritual or routine can tell your brain that it is time for sleep. Your brain, in turn, can send signals indicating that melatonin production should be increased.

, Those suffering from hypothyroidism can consult their doctor about getting thyroid replacement therapy.


Hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness, constipation, fatigue, elevated cholesterol, joint pain, and depression. In severe cases, it can cause decreased breathing, decreased body temperature, and coma.
Patients receiving thyroid therapy receive synthetic thyroid hormone in the form of oral medication."

Learn how to apply makeup.,
Learn how to properly dress as a preteen.,
Your outfit.,
Never leave your room without a bit of makeup on.,
Now you are ready.",How to Be a Preteen Who is Reasonably Mature2," Subtle makeup adds charm and flirtatiousness to your face. Well-done makeup is sheer; it should enhance your looks without being obvious. If you're unsure how, try getting a makeover at a cosmetic counter or spa, and ask the operator to show you how to apply the products effectively.

, How you dress affects how people treat you. Subtleness is key when it comes to your wardrobe. Modesty may seem like an old-fashioned concept, but clothes that fit well (not too tight or too baggy) and cover your torso make you look more mature and grown-up. Find a style that fits your personality, then pick clothes that work together on you.

, The number one rule for mature tweens and preteens is NEVER have words on your clothes. If you have clothes like these, and they are expensive, don't throw them away. Just never wear them until your parents forget you had it. Wear lots of those same bedroom colors. Never wear gray cotton or wool. This is a one way ticket to make people think you're from lazyville.

, Make this very subtle. Let's start on Monday. Use some of your moms makeup. Put a TINY bit of foundation on and and little lip gloss. Do you hair in a sleek style, with a little bang or hair down in the front.

, Have a peaceful day in your room with your new phone and color. Relax.

Delay your reactions.,
Alleviate the sources of anger temporarily.,
Identify and avoid triggers of anger.,
Think positive.,
View yourself through others’ eyes.,
Exercise or do yoga.,
Open better lines of communication.,
Practice meditation.,
Use humor to diffuse tense situations.",How to Cope With Anger2," As stated above, people with anger issues often rely on anger as a first reaction to any source of stress or frustration. One useful method of controlling or coping with your anger can be deliberately delaying any reaction you have to a situation. This delay will give you time to compose yourself before outwardly expressing anger towards those around you. Many people use a method of counting to ten before they react to a stressful situation to ensure that they have had time to process the information they have just encountered and can offer an appropriate or measured response., If you are just now realizing that you are becoming angry too quickly or too often, there is a good chance that you are not a naturally angry person, but are just temporarily coping with a situation that is making you angry. Taking a vacation or some personal time off can contribute to lowering your overall stress level. Once you have taken this temporary leave, you can often come back to the situation that makes you angry with a new outlook and a greater level of composure. This should help to quell your expressions of anger., Sometimes, a person who often gets angry is simply reacting to consistently frustrating social or professional interactions. For example, you may be angry much of the time because you are working in a stress-filled situation or have surrounded yourself with people whose views, opinions or actions make you angry. If this is the case for you, it can be helpful to know that you are not an angry person, but have willingly put yourself in situations that make you angry.People are different and they have different thresholds of tolerance under various circumstances. If you work in a high-stress job and are consistently angry as a result, it can be beneficial to find a different line of work. If you are constantly upset or angry with the way your friends and family behave or voice their opinions, it may be time to separate yourself from those people and surround yourself with people who behave or think in manner that seems more appropriate or palatable to you., An important method to coping with anger is to realize that there is more to living than voicing your displeasure with frustrating situations all the time. Your life should be a pursuit of happiness. When you begin to get upset, take solace in the things that make you truly happy., A useful mechanism for coping with your anger is to reflect on how you would deal with your own reaction if you were someone else by putting yourself in the shoes of the person who had to react to your angry outburst. You may realize that your response was not appropriate, and that you may have wanted to handle the situation more positively., You may find engaging in physical activities, such as running, tennis, or yoga, help alleviate the frequency and level of anger you feel in social and professional settings. Expending your energy in other ways on a regular basis may make you less prone to angry or emphatic outbursts., Sometimes, getting angry can be the result of incessant miscommunication with others. If you work on cultivating better communication techniques, you may find that your day-to-day interactions with others is less frustrating, leading to fewer outbursts of anger., Meditation has been shown to have positive short-term effects on emotional processing. In addition to having an effect on physical relaxation and a sense of peacefulness, a Harvard study has shown that mindful meditation increased grey matter density in areas of the brain related to learning, memory, self-awareness, compassion, and introspection., If you find yourself in a situation that is frustrating, try using silly humor to lighten the mood. Making fun or lighthearted jokes can bring down your tension levels, as well as the tension levels of those around you, making your social interactions much less likely to escalate to a point where you feel the need to become angry."

Be aware that some people need help controlling anger.,
Find local anger management groups.,
Attend anger management sessions.,
Continue attending support groups.,
Practice what you've learned in your anger management sessions.,
Assist others with their problems.",How to Cope With Anger3," If simple coping mechanisms prove ineffective in dealing with your feelings of anger and fail to stop you from reacting angrily, your problem may not be something you can fix on your own. A plethora of books and websites provide techniques for controlling your anger, but you may find you need additional, face-to-face assistance when it comes to coping with your anger., Anger management is not a problem from which you alone suffer. There are likely many groups in your area that can provide you with support in dealing with your anger issues. Research and identify the types of groups that you feel will be the most beneficial for you. Sometimes these groups are composed of regular people like yourself who have problems controlling their anger. Others are headed by licensed professionals. Some of the groups are free and open to the public while others are fee-based and exclusive to certain members of the community. Find a group that is right for you. Searching online, consulting with a doctor or asking a friend or colleague who has had similar issues are all great ways to help you identify legitimate anger management resources in your area., Coming together with individuals who suffer from the same anger management problems as you will provide you with tangible methods for coping with your anger. These groups can also provide a safe place for you to express your feelings of anger in a nurturing and understanding environment. Finally, the support of a group can help you devise and stick to an anger management routine or plan. Anger management sessions provide specific techniques or ways of thinking that help you minimize and control your anger. While books and online resources provide general solutions for anger management, these sessions can help you develop and tailor an anger management routine that is specific for your needs., Even after you have seen some improvement in dealing with your anger issues, it is possible to relapse and fall back into to negative patterns of behavior or thinking. That is why it is critical to attend anger management classes regularly, even after you have begun to employ methods for controlling your anger.There is no established time frame for ending your anger management sessions. While there may be a point when you feel you don't need them anymore, you should allow a trained professional to tell when it is safe to stop attending.

, Anger management classes, groups or sessions provide you with the framework for dealing with stress in your day-to-day life. It is up to you to put these theoretical methods into actual practice. Employ the techniques you acquired in anger management in real life situations and gauge the end results of utilizing these techniques. When you know how these techniques work or don't work for you in real life situations, anger management sessions can help you find alternative solutions or reinforce the techniques that do work. So, be prepared to put what you have learned into use and report the results in your anger management sessions to achieve the most favorable outcome., Anger management classes are not just for you. You may find that, after attending these classes or groups for some time, you are equally capable of helping those people with similar problems. Not only does this help the other individuals in your group, but will also lend some perspective to your own anger management issues."

Think about what you hope to get out of the conversation.,
Do your research.,
Get comfortable with the subject yourself.,
Find a time to talk to your mom.,
Think about questions to ask her.,
Ask her about her own experiences.,
Approach your mom and bring up the subject.",How to Ask Your Mom About Puberty (for Girls)," Before just walking up to your mom and bringing up puberty, you should sit and think about it for a while. Are you looking for general advice, medical explanations, help with preparation, a shopping trip, a shoulder to cry on, or all of the above? Your mom will understand how tough it is to ask for advice and help, and make it as easy as she can to make the topic comfortable and informative for you.


The first and probably most important thing to remember when talking to mom is that she went through the exact same thing. No matter how old a woman is, at your age they were curious, shy, and worried about their body, just like you!;
, You want to make sure you know what you are talking about. You can find out practically anything online, but make sure you use reliable sources like Kids Health, hhs.gov, or WebMD. Learn the basics of what will happen to your body, and learn about what's going on internally. This way, when you talk to your mom, you'll have a better idea of what questions you should ask. Going to the bookstore and spending a little money on a puberty book they sell in the Women's Health section will also give you more trustworthy knowledge, so when you bring the subject up with your mom, you have an idea what to ask.


Learn about puberty in boys, too. Although you yourself won't be going through this, it will help you to understand what the boys in your school are going through.

, If can't even think about puberty without cringing, talking about it with someone else might just make you severely embarrassed and nervous, rather than helping you learn more about the subject. You should be comfortable enough with puberty that talking about it with your mom will help you learn more and become more prepared to face it, without subjecting you to undue discomfort or embarrassment. Reading and thinking more about it, as well as talking to friends, a doctor or school nurse, or anyone else, will help you get more comfortable with the subject.

, When you have researched puberty and become comfortable with the idea of it, you're ready to bring it up with your mom. Find a time when you two are alone so that you can begin the discussion. Invite her out to coffee or lunch for a date in order to make sure you have plenty of time to talk, or find that time even by just helping her while she cooks.

, Have an idea of how you can bring up the subject. This doesn't have to be an elaborate ruse - simply saying ""Mom, I want to ask you about puberty"" will bring up the subject in a simple, matter-of-fact way. Think about why you're talking to her. What do you want to know? Do you have questions, concerns, or fears? Do you need something specific, or are you just looking for general advice? You don't need to write down a list of questions or make it feel like an interview, but having a good idea of what kind of information you're looking for will help you get the most out of the conversation.

, Say ""Hey Mom, when you were my age..."" or ""Mom, did you ever...?"" Chances are, she was just as nervous and embarrassed back then as you are now. Asking her about her own experiences is a great way to draw connections between the two of you, make her remember what it was like to be in your position, and help her understand what you're feeling right now. You will also benefit from hearing about her experiences, so that you don't have to repeat her mistakes.

, You have researched and familiarized yourself with puberty. You have thought about what you want to know, and you've planned a time for the conversation. Now all there is left is to go for the gold. Approach your mom at the planned time and simply bring up your question. She will be happy that you came to her with your questions, and she'll be excited to share her experiences.

Puberty is such a worrying thing that some people will enjoy making you even more worried about your body. If you know someone is a liar, don't listen to what they say and just leave them alone.;
, If you make out that you're not worried by anything you're told, the liars and teasers should leave you alone. If you listen to them or seem to be taking in what they say, they'll come back again and again.

, People in these conversations BRAG. They will exaggerate anything about their body or their sordid exploits, and you would be well advised to avoid these conversations.

, If you're trying to stop someone following you around and talking about puberty, stay near an adult. Any adolescent following you won't want to be overheard, so they'll go away.

, If your friends are misinformed, they might pass that misinformation back to you. If you see someone you talk to about puberty talking with bullies or the braggers, encourage them to come away and do something else.

Don't give in to peer pressure.,
Learn to say ""No"".,
Know what will and won't result in pregnancy.,
Understand the effectiveness of different forms of birth control.,
Use protection.,
Make sure you know how to put on a condom.,
Make sure you know which types of contraception don't consistently work.,
Don't leave anything to chance.,
Know what to do if a pregnancy occurs.",How to Avoid a Teenage Pregnancy," Many teenagers can feel left out/behind when their friends start to have boyfriends, or start having sex. Those who have started to do these things early can often talk about it enough to make others feel left out. However, if you do stand your ground and wait until you know you are ready, you will be glad of it. It means you'll have waited for the right person and the right time.


Everyone develops at different rates, both physically and mentally, so don't feel that you should be racing your peers for things like having sex and getting boyfriends.
Many of your peers will regret their choices in time. Others could even be lying. Don't just start having sex because other people are if you aren't ready to do it yourself.;
, This includes saying no to anything you feel uncomfortable with. Whether it's refusing to have a boyfriend, have any kind of physical contact, have sex or have sex without protection, there is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself. The only 100% safe way to avoid pregnancy is to not have sex, so you shouldn't feel stupid for not wanting to go through with something.

, With sex in general, there are a lot of myths about what will get you pregnant and what will keep you from getting pregnant. A lot of these myths are simple misinformation, and some of them are lies designed to deceive you. Arm yourself with the facts and lower your chances of pregnancy the safe, smart way.


Unprotected vaginal sex has the highest likelihood of resulting in pregnancy. Male sperm fertilizes the female egg, resulting in the growth of a fetus. Unprotected sex also carries a high risk of disease and infection.
Pulling out carries some risk of pregnancy. Studies show that typical use of withdrawal has a 18% chance of resulting in pregnancy.This is because some sperm may be released in the male's pre-seminal fluid, or simply because the male doesn't pull out quickly enough.
Unprotected anal sex by itself cannot result in unwanted pregnancy.But because the anus and the vagina are extremely close to each other, there is a chance that sperm could accidentally leak into the vagina, causing pregnancy. Unprotected anal sex carries with it an increased likelihood of STIs, especially HIV/AIDS.
Oral sex cannot result in pregnancy. As long as the penis does not come in contact with the vagina, there is no possibility that oral sex can lead to unwanted pregnancy.The likelihood of transmitting some STIs, however, is increased with oral sex.

, All birth controls are not created equal. Some work better than others, and some are preferred by different individuals for different reasons. It helps to know a little about what each form of birth control is, and how effective they are.


Wearing a condom fails about 17% of the time, mostly because of improper usage, and in rare cases, because of manufacturing error. If worn correctly however, condoms work more effectively than pulling out.
Consider a birth control shot. Depo-Provera only costs twenty dollars a month.
The pill and the patch, which avoid pregnancy by preventing the female's ovulation cycle,have about an 8% chance of causing pregnancy with typical use.With proper usage, however, the pill has a 99% success rate in preventing unwanted pregnancy.Intrauterine Devices, or IUDs, fail less than 1% of the time.They fall into either hormonal IUD, or copper IUD, and require no upkeep. Some IUDs can stay in place for 10 years., Remember that many types of sexual intercourse can cause pregnancy. The best thing to do would be to talk about contraception choices with your partner before having sex, as there are many choices such as the birth control pill, condoms and spermicide.


If you aren’t comfortable enough with your partner to talk to him or her about protection, you aren't ready to have sex with them. Make sure that you are fully educated about the effectiveness of all of the different types of birth control before making a decision.
If you are in doubt about your best options, visit your doctor. They aren't allowed to tell anyone about what you spoke about, and will give you good advice. Don't be embarrassed; they will have dealt with things like this many times before.

, If you’re a girl, don’t leave it up to the guy to put it on, as he may object or try talking you out of it. Play it cool: If he says, “I don’t want to put a condom on,” just grin and respond with, “No worries – I’ll put it on for you!” Arm yourself with the knowledge of how to put one on properly and refuse to take no for an answer. And remember, if the guy you’re about to have sex with can’t be bothered to protect his and your health, get out of there and consider yourself lucky for dodging a bullet.


If you are worried about being caught unprepared then the best thing to do would be to go on the birth-control pill and/or to always have a condom in your bag.
Bear in mind that condoms are the only way to effectively protect yourself against STIs, or sexually transmitted infections. Do not let yourself be persuaded into having unprotected sex!
Condoms are often given away for free at places such as schools, colleges and family planning clinics. In many countries, birth control such as the pill or the injection are also available for free.

, When you're young it can be confusing to hear about all of the different types of birth control, and all of the rumors that come with it. Therefore it can be confusing to work out which ones are actually effective. So here are some of the methods you should avoid. These things do decrease the possibility of pregnancy slightly, but are not effective contraceptive techniques on their own:


Natural family planning. This is when you use your menstrual cycle, or temperature to help predict when you are ovulating and when you are least fertile. It requires commitment and is only effective if used correctly and tracked over time. It's especially ineffective during your teenage years since teenage cycles can be erratic and therefore difficult to predict.
The withdrawal method. This is where the man has to 'pull out' before ejaculation. This is extremely unreliable since pre-ejaculation can leak out before he actually climaxes, which can then lead to pregnancy. As well as this is you'd have to trust him to control himself.

, If you have had sex and either you didn't use protection or your protection wasn't effective (e.g. condom split) then don't leave it to chance. Get hold of the Plan B contraceptive/morning after pill, which can prevent a possible pregnancy within 3 days of sexual intercourse (although the sooner you have it, the more effective it will be).


The morning after pill should not be used as a birth-control method, but as an emergency aid. It's not healthy to consistently use.
Emergency contraception causes a short but strong burst of hormonal changes that prevent ovulation. It will not cause an abortion., If you think that there is a chance that you or your partner might be pregnant, you get a pregnancy test as soon as possible. These can be done for free at some pharmacists or by your doctor. It's important to find out as soon as possible if you are pregnant because it leaves more options for what to do about it.


It's important to be aware of options available to you such as getting the baby adopted, or choosing to keep and raise the baby yourself.

Understand when therapy is necessary.,
Research therapists in your area.,
Set aside resources and time for therapy.,
Be open to various explanations of why you are angry.,
Follow the therapist’s instructions and treatments.",How to Cope With Anger4," If you are considering therapy with a licensed professional to help cope with your anger management problems, it is likely that you have tried some other avenues in dealing with your anger. You need to know when individual coping mechanisms or group sessions are not effective and seek help from a respected therapist., Therapists, like others in the medical professionals, focus on various areas of specialization. While a general therapist who will allow you to talk out your problems can be helpful, it is important to identify therapists who have experience in treating anger management problems. Also, it is critical to vet the credentials and client satisfaction of the therapists in your area to ensure that the therapist you select is the right one for you. , Therapy with a licensed professional is often an ongoing process that can last for years or even a lifetime. Make sure you have accounted for the money and the time needed to dedicate to therapy. Like many issues that require a therapist, your problem may never disappear, but you can manage it.Also, be aware that local, state and national resources exist for offsetting the cost of therapy for those who need it, but can not afford it. Check with your state department of health and human services to see what resources exist for offsetting the costs of therapy., When you seek out a licensed therapist, be prepared to deal with some unpleasant episodes in your life and be open to the therapist’s explanation of your problem. You may find that you learned inappropriate anger-coping mechanisms when you were a child or that you suffer from underlying mental disorder that causes your expressions of anger. It is critical when meeting with a therapist that you are open and accepting of the explanations they may provide to you. You wouldn’t want to waste your time and money seeing a therapist for help only because you were unwilling to engage or tell him/her the full truth., After meeting with a therapist for some time, he or she may decide you need to adhere to certain practices or methods to control your anger. You must follow through with a therapist’s suggestions to ensure the therapy is as beneficial as possible. Furthermore, you may find that you need certain medications if the source of your anger is an underlying mental disorder. If this is case, take any and all medications as they are prescribed and do not deviate from the dosing schedules.Again, be aware that these conditions are relatively rare among the general population.
One of the biggest problems facing individuals with mental disorders is that they begin to feel “better” or “okay” after taking their prescribed medication. This, in turn, leads them to believe that they no longer need the prescribed medication and they stop taking it. In these circumstances, the symptoms of the mental disorder can become drastically worse without the afflicted individual realizing it.
Of course, you are always free to seek out a second opinion or stop taking medication that you do not feel is effective or right for you. It is your choice, but be aware of the potential consequences.

Don’t worry about not learning the material because doodling and taking notes will actually help you focus on the material better. , Avoid laughing by thinking about something unpleasant. Distract yourself by thinking about your homework or any upcoming tests. If this doesn’t work, think about something that really upsets you.Make a list of unpleasant topics in advance to make it easier to think about them during class.

, Try to contain your laughter. Do your best to hold it in. Don’t try speaking in case opening your mouth to talk makes you laugh.

, Ask to go to the water fountain or bathroom if you really need to laugh. Laugh once you’re outside of class. Wait a bit and calm down before you go back to class.

Start eating healthier.,
Start exercising more.,
Catch up on your sleep.",How to Be a Healthy Teenager1," Eating healthy is really important if you want to be a healthy teen. You don't need to go on a diet, just pay attention to what you're putting in your body.


If you only ever eat sugary breakfast cereals and candy bars you aren't going to be healthy. Depending on your body and what works best for you, you can eat three meals a day or 5-6 mini-meals a day. NEVER skip meals. Try healthy alternatives, instead of having a bowl of ice-cream, opt for a frozen yogurt. Or try having apple slices instead of potato chips.
Drink more water. This is basically the most important thing of all. If you drink more water you will be much healthier. It flushes the toxins out of your body and gives your skin a healthy glow. It also keeps your skin hydrated and helps prevent spots. It also helps if you have acne. As a general rule of thumb, try to drink a lot to the point where your urine is almost completely clear.;
, Whether it's walking in the park, or doing a couple of crunches do at least 20 minutes of physical activity several times a week.


You should not exercise every day, when you work out you break your muscles down. It's the rebuilding that makes them stronger. If you don't give them time to rebuild, you're going to seriously hurt yourself.
Exercise will make you stronger and tone your muscles. You can go to the gym and swim or run on the treadmill, buy a few work out DVDs, or just go for a jog around the block.
Whatever it is, exercising will make you healthier and happier about your body. It also reduces stress and helps to calm the mind!

, During puberty you'll find you need more sleep than you did when you were younger. Sure it's tempting to stay up late chatting with friends on the phone or computer, but the next morning you'll be miserable


You need to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep every single night. To find out how many hours you personally should be sleeping, on a weekend go to bed at the time you do on a school night and don't set your alarm. When you wake up count how many hours you were asleep and get that many hours every night.
It may be tough if you get back late and have to wake up early on a normal school day, but if you put the extra effort in of an early night you will feel much more refreshed the next morning. This will aid your concentration and you will be in a much happier and friendly mood.

True CPS workers will not have a problem with showing you their identification card, and every CPS worker should carry one., You are of course upset by the fact that your child is involved in an investigation. Nonetheless, it is CPS' responsibility to follow up with every report of neglect or abuse. This policy protects kids in bad situations. If they show up at your door, it means that someone has issued a report about your situation.That doesn't mean that you are automatically going to have your kids taken away. It just means that CPS needs to make sure everything is alright in your home.In fact, CPS is in place to help you if you may have trouble in the future. For instance, if you are having trouble making ends meet, they can put you in touch with the right resources so that you don't neglect your child by not being able to provide proper food or shelter., The report may not be directed at you. In fact, it may be another adult in the child's life that CPS is investigating. Any person who is involved in child care can come under investigation, from nurses and doctors to ministers and teachers., The workers will want to interview your child alone. CPS wants to be able to talk to your child without interference and hopefully get the truth from them., Of course, you're angry at the thought of someone investigating you or someone in your child's life. However, getting angry and refusing to answer questions will only make the situation worse. In fact, workers are given the right by law to interview you. Refusing could mean they take your kids away right away, rather than using the information you and your child give to assess the situation., If it is apparent that your child has been abused or neglected, CPS can call in the police to remove your children. The police will place them in protective custody for 3 days, not counting weekends and holidays. During that time period, a hearing will be scheduled to judge whether the removal was warranted.Based on what happens at that hearing, your children may be returned to you. On the other hand, if the judge thinks that you should not currently have access to your children, they will be placed with a relative, if one is available. If not, they will be placed in foster care.That doesn't mean your children are gone permanently; it just means that you have to make some serious changes before you get them back., Even if you are not required to go to the hearing, it is important for you to be there. It shows you care about what happens to your child. You will be notified of when the hearing will be. You can also hire a lawyer to represent you at the hearing, especially if you are required to be at the hearing. If you can't afford one, the court should provide one for you., First, CPS is making sure that your child is not being physically abused, either by you or another adult in their life. Physical abuse includes any physical harm that comes to your child intentionally, from being hit to being burned or cut.It can also include anything that could have seriously injured your child but did not do so at the time, such as shooting a gun in front of them.Signs of abuse include bruises, cuts, bite marks, and burns.Though spanking is still allowed in most states, it is not okay for parents to leave marks on a child from spanking, including bruises., This type of abuse is when a child comes to emotional harm because the parent or another adult tells them they are worthless or unloved. Emotional abuse can also result from a child witnessing violent actions.Other actions can lead to emotional abuse, too. For instance, locking a child in a closet is considered emotional abuse, as well as alienating the child or trashing something the child values greatly.Signs of emotional abuse include a child who isolates themself or is overly active; she also may have speech problems or may not be as developed as she should be physically., Neglect is when a child is not properly cared for. This type of abuse can happen when a family cannot provide adequate food or shelter for a child. It can also happen when a child is left with someone who is not responsible enough to care for the child, which can include someone who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Your CPS worker will be looking for signs such as extreme hunger, extreme thinness, improper hygiene, and untreated diseases or wounds., Sexual abuse is any sexual activity performed with or on a child. It can include anything from showing pornographic material to a child to engaging in or attempting to engage in any sexual activity with a child.Some signs of sexual abuse include difficulty with sitting or walking, ripped or stained underwear, and bruises., Though your child is in protective custody, you should stay in contact if you are allowed to do so. That shows you care for your child's well-being and what happens to them., One way to show that you are ready for your child to return is to make a plan. Start with what the court objected to. Maybe you were in abusive relationship with a partner or maybe you couldn't afford to feed your child. Show you are changing by getting out of the relationship and joining a support group. Show you can support your child by getting a better job or applying for food stamps if you need to do so., CPS will not leave you on your own to deal with righting your life. They will work with you to make your life better, including helping you make a plan. They'll also put you in touch with resources you need to help put your life back together., You will be required to attend a number of appointments in relation to your child. You also need to show up for any court hearings set up for you or your child. It's important to show CPS that your care about what happens to your child., All children need praise and love, and you should provide that for your child on a regular basis. Tell them when they're doing a good job at something and remind them often that you love them.You can also support your child by making sure they get to school on time. Also, encourage them to have friends and invite them over when possible.
You can also support them by asking about their day, making sure they do their homework, and helping them get involved in activities they enjoy.

, Your child needs this structure so they know what they can count on from day today. In addition, it helps keep you accountable. For instance, your kids should know that you will be there to pick them up from school or daycare everyday. They should also know what to expect when they get home, such as they need to do homework until dinnertime. Try to establish a routine at night where you get to spend time with your child, whether it's eating dinner together or reading a bedtime story together.Be in control of your life. Make sure that you, yourself have a personal routine. It can take a while getting used to having control of both your daily happenings and the happenings of your children, but work on it bit-by-bit, day-by-day.
Take it step-by-step. For instance, if your goal is to have dinner together every night together, start with having dinner together every night, no matter whether it's fast food or home cooking. Next, move toward cooking for the family. Keep adding parts until you have a steady, healthy environment for your family.

, Part of your daily routine should be instilling good personal hygiene habits in your kids, from helping them brush their teeth to teaching them to wash their hands and bath. In addition, establish a schedule for housecleaning, such as laundry on Fridays and get your kids helping with chores. It will help you keep up with the housework and instill responsibility in them., Part of this step is eating healthy, but it's also making sure you and your kids have regular checkups. Healthcare is more affordable now because you can qualify for subsidies to help pay for it. Check with your state's healthcare exchange or with the federal government's healthcare exchange if your state doesn't offer one. If you can't afford health insurance, you may qualify for Medicaid; ask your CPS worker to put you in touch with the right people to apply.Make sure you're offering your child plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins such as fish and chicken, and whole grains. Dairy is also important for growing bodies.Also, encourage exercise in your family. Take walks together, or go to the park. If your kids are inside playing video games, try limiting screen time. Send them outside to play., Being a parent isn't easy, but you do have resources to help make it better. CPS may require you to take parenting classes, but even if they don't, it may be a good idea to find a free parenting class in your area. If you're not sure where you can find one, ask your CPS worker, as he or she will be happy to help you find one in your area.These classes can help you learn how to deal with your children when they get angry or messy. They can also help you build relationships with other parents.

, You have to work on a relationship with your child just like you work on relationships with other people in your life. Make sure you make time to spend with your child, and make sure you follow through with what you say you will do. Your child will only trust you if you give them a reason to, by doing what you say. It also means respecting who they are as a person. That is, give value to their opinions and their being. However, she also must learn to respect you, which you help them do by setting appropriate boundaries.One way you show your child you respect them is by listening to them. For instance, if they have a problem, don't just brush it off as silly. It's important to them. Take the time to listen, and help them figure out a solution., Finding and keeping a job is not always easy, but for your kids' benefit, you or someone in your household needs to be able to hold down a job. You need to be able to provide financially for your child in one way or another.

, One of the keys of keeping your children from abuse is making sure you keep abusive people out of their lives. Make sure the adults in their life are trustworthy enough to be around your kids.


Just like CPS, you should be watching for signs of abuse in your child, such as bruises, your child suddenly becoming withdrawn, or bloody or torn underwear. If you notice signs of abuse, call in CPS and use their expertise to help figure out where the problem is.If your bringing the abusive adult into your child's life by being in abusive relationship, take steps to get out of it. The best way is to cut the person out of your life completely, which is harder than it sounds, especially if the person wants to continue to control you.However, you do have resources available. If you fear for you or child's safety, call the police. If the problem is less immediate, you can call the National Domestic Violence Helpline, 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE), which can put you in touch with resources in your community.CPS workers will also be able to help.

, Once you have resolved your issues, it's time to lead by example. Good parents do not do things that they don't want their children to do. If you want your children to be caring, nurturing people, you need to create a caring, nurturing environment for them. If you expect your children to listen when you speak, you need to listen when they speak. They're watching you to learn how to act., CPS has many programs and resources to help you prevent a relapse. It’s imperative that you take advantage of the help that they offer you. Not only will this help you, but it will indicate to the case worker that you’re stepping up to the plate and wanting to improve yourself for the betterment of your family.

Start by changing the foods you eat.,
If you can, eat 5 meals a day instead of 3.,
Don't eat anything past 8:00 p.m. Give your system enough time to break down your food.,
Drink lots of water.,
Exercise!,
Sleep, sleep, sleep!,
Limit your screen time to 2 hours a day, at the very most.,
Have good hygiene.,
Keep your life simple and happy.",How to Be a Healthy Preteen Girl," Exchange those potato chips to some carrots and low fat ranch or some fresh fruits. Ask your parents to make some healthier dishes, such as grilled or baked chicken rather than fried. Don't eat junk food,fast food,or sweets more than twice a week.;
, Yes, 5. But instead of large meals, make them small. You could do something like this: eat a small bowl of low-sugar cereal with fresh fruit and skim milk in it in the morning, eat some cheese and crackers and a piece of fresh fruit at your snack/break time at school, eat a whole wheat or multi-grain sandwich with a little mayo or honey mustard, turkey, spinach, a slice of cheese, and some chopped onions on it, and pair it with some carrot sticks at lunch, eat celery and peanut butter with apple slices when you get home from school, and get a very small portion of the dinner your parents prepare for you in the evening. Eating in small portions 5 times a day will make it easier for your system to break down your food, and eating this often will hold you over until your next meal.

, Studies show that food eaten between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. are stored as fat. If you must eat,eat something small and healthy, like a few apple slices.

, A good rule is to drink half your body weight in ounces. So a 80 pound girl should drink about 40 oz of water. Keep in mind though, that if you're eating a healthy diet with fruit and vegetables, you'll need a few ounces less. Water flushes out toxins, hydrates you, and many other wonderful things. But, before gulping down 20 glasses a day, I urge you to realize that there is such a thing as water poisoning, and way too much water can be harmful to your body.

, It is so important to exercise. Get an hour of moderate exercise each day at least 5 times per week. Moderate exercise is dancing, swimming, jogging, etc. Resistance training is good too, but should not be done more than twice a week. There is such a thing as too much exercise, so limit your exercise to 2-3 hours per session.

, Preteen girls need 8 1/2 to 10 hours of good, sound sleep. So if you have to get up for school at 7, I would suggest going to bed at 9:30. If you take around an hour to actually fall asleep, it may be hard, but you should be in bed by 8:30. Some girls might need a little more. Also, if you can fit an a power nap, which lasts about 20 to 30 minutes, into your afternoon, by all means do so. It is beneficial to your health to get plenty of sleep. Remember that if you take a nap at 3:00 or later, it will be hard for your body to fall asleep once it's your bedtime. So make a limit, say, that you won't sleep in the daytime past 3:30 or something.

, Screen time is time you spend in front of any type of screen, may it be the TV, the computer, a video game, an iPod, a cell phone, or any other device with a screen. It would be wonderful if you could avoid the TV and the computer all of the school week, but if you can't, try to avoid it as much as possible.

, Take showers every day. Brush twice a day, floss once a day and use mouthwash at least once a week. Be sure to use deodorant.

, No, not every other day: every day. Because of puberty, your sweat glands are becoming more active, and are creating different chemicals that cause sweat to turn into a disgusting odor.


So, to make sure you're getting rid of all this smelly odor,you should use a mild soap and warm water! Even if it's hot outside, you need to shower in warm water, because that opens up your pores which means you get to clean more of that smell off of you.
Then rinse off in cold water to shut your pores and eliminate the amount of bacteria that makes you stink.

, Boys, that means changing your socks and underwear every day. Girls, that means washing your bra every day if your active or every other day if you weren't very active.

, Strive to try to brush your teeth after every meal! When brushing your teeth, hold your brush at an angle so it lines up with your gum line.


Brush back and forth making sure to get every single tooth. Be sure to use a soft bristle brush so you don't damage your gums. And either use your brush or a tongue scraper to get rid of all the bacteria on your tongue. If you don't know this, bad breath mostly comes from either poor eating habits or poor brushing habits.
After you brush for three minutes floss and use a good mouthwash. Though you should floss twice a day, if you're only going to floss once make it at night so you don't have pieces of food rotting between your teeth all night.
Mouth wash and brushing your teeth alone won't get rid of bad breath, you need to floss to get rid of the pieces of food in your mouth. If you don't those pieces will gather bacteria which gives off a bad odor.

, Don't harshly scrub! Slowly and gently wash your face, using a circular motion.


You should never pop pimples, this will lead to scarring and possible infection. Try to keep your hands off your face, otherwise the oils on your hands will transfer to your face and cause break outs.
Always remove makeup from your face before you go to sleep and keep your hair clean to eliminate the amount of oil that gets on your face.
Be sure not to wash your face too much as it may dry up the skin completely and cause itchiness or irritation.

, Most people need to do this every day, but if your hair produces very little oil you may be able to only wash your hair every other day.


Ask someone what they think, just because it doesn't look greasy to you doesn't mean it isn't. However, don't wash your hair too much as your hair needs some of those oils. Over washing can cause an itchy or irritated scalp and dandruff, so only wash it when needed.
Use a shampoo and conditioner meant for your type of hair. If you use hair products every two or three weeks wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build up.

, If you're a teenage boy, you may start shaving your face, and if you're a teenage girl, you may start shaving your legs and underarms. Here's some tips:

Shave with the grain; this will give you a lesser chance of getting in-grown hairs which hurt a lot.
Wait about half an hour before applying anything to the area, such as lotions or deodorant, or your skin may become irritated.

If you don't have many friends then make the effort to go out and meet some new ones; it's not as hard as it may seem! Join a club or sports team where you can meet people with similar interests to your own.
Just try to avoid social events that involve dangerous or unhealthy activities such as drinking or taking drugs, as this will just cancel out everything in this article!

, Teenagers often have a rather bumpy relationship with their parents and tend to rebel against parental authority.


However, it's important to remember that your parents are only concerned for your safety and happiness and if they don't allow you to do something it's probably because they don't think it's safe or in your best interests.
Therefore, the best way to deal with disagreements is to have a calm, reasoned discussion with your parents, not a screaming tantrum. Remind them that you are a mature, sensible almost-adult who is capable of making good decisions. You'll get a lot more leeway if you use this approach!

, While having a boyfriend or girlfriend is all part of the the fun of being a teenager, you shouldn't let your relationship take over your life.


Don't ditch your friends in favor of your latest boyfriend or girlfriend -- he or she may only last a couple of months, but friends are for life!
Don't be too heartbroken if things don't work out. You can be pretty certain that the guy or girl you dated for 6 weeks in ninth grade wasn't the love of your life! So get out there and meet someone new!
Be sexually responsible. If you make the decision to become sexually active as teenager, make sure to do so responsibly. Always use protection and regularly get yourself checked out for any STDs.

, It's important to maintain good relationships with your teachers by behaving well in class, handing in assignments on time and maintaining good grades.


Having a good relationship with your teachers can make your school experience much smoother and more pleasant and can really work in your favor when it comes to applying to colleges.
Most of your teachers are smart, interesting people (even if you don't think they're cool) so respect them and learn all you can from them, before it's too late.

Embrace what makes you ""different."",
Reach out for help if you need it.",How to Be a Healthy Teen Girl3," Your personal health and habits are for you and your well being, not for anyone else's. Don't get dragged down or caught up in the opinions of others. If you know you are healthy, you will feel good about yourself. So be positive and believe in yourself!



Think positive thoughts. What you tell yourself in your head can really affect how you feel and perceive the world around you. If you make a mistake, think “I’m human,” instead of, “I’m such a loser.”Don't compare yourself to others. That can get you down and then you won’t remember everything that makes you amazing!
Don’t believe that everyone on the internet is as happy as they seem. Sure, everyone on Facebook and Twitter seem to have amazing, glamorous lives. Remember that everyone has problems and struggles, and probably try to appear happier than they really are.

, Journaling, music, art – do something to express yourself in a creative way. This can help you reduce stress, learn to value your positive attributes, and feel accomplished. Experiment with hobbies and skills, and remember it doesn’t matter if you’re naturally talented – this is just for you.


Everyone can do something creative. Learn a musical instrument, draw, paint, craft, build something, or create a lovely garden.

, Body image, how you view your physical self and if you feel attractive, can be closely linked to self esteem for many people.Having positive body image is extremely important for you as a teen, since you might feel pressured by peers or media to look different than you do.

Treat it with respect and appreciate it for all its uniqueness.
Recognize which elements of your appearance you can change, and which you can’t. Let go of the things you can’t change. Remember that everyone has something about themselves they don’t like very much.

Set goals to change the things you can change. If you want to lose weight, create a diet and exercise plan. If you feel like your hair is boring, experiment with a new cut.
Compliment yourself every day, at least three times per day. Tell yourself something nice and honest, something you truly feel.

, Between school, homework, friends, family, work, a partner, and personal time, you have a lot to juggle! Developing time management skills will help you get everything done you need to do and not feel overwhelmed. Develop a system that works well for you by trying some of these ideas:Make a To-Do list for the week with three columns: Have to do, Would like to accomplish (but could wait a little longer), and Want to do (leisure).
Use calendar updates on your phone or GoogleDocs for easy access to your schedule.
Break up big tasks into smaller tasks. Clean the house could break down into clean the toilets, tidy up my bedroom, and “do the dishes.”
Get ready for your day the night before. This way you won’t be scrambling in the morning and maybe forget something.
Keep your items organized by having a place for everything; it’s much harder to lose things that way.
Time yourself to learn how long things really take, versus how long you think they take. Use an app like 30/30.

, You might be stressed out if you feel edgy, tired, depressed, or guilty. Other signs that you’re too stressed are if you get headaches or have stomach trouble, can’t sleep well, often think negative thoughts, don’t enjoy things you used to, resent other people or the things you have to do, or blame other people for things that happen to you.Minimize stress by trying some of these ideas:


List the things that are stressing you out. Divide them into things you can control and things you can’t. Accept the things that you can’t change.
Make changes where you can. If you feel like you’re too busy to accomplish everything you need to, stop doing your least important activity.
Say “no” to doing things you don’t want to do or don’t have time to do. You’re not obligated to help others if it interferes with your own wellbeing.
Talk to someone, including friends, family, or a counselor. Try journaling just to vent your frustrations.
Try acupuncture, massage, relaxation techniques, or yoga. Though there is limited scientific data on how teens use complementary medicine, some people find them very beneficial., “Healthy” is not necessarily synonymous with “skinny.” Teen obesity is a major concern in some countries, especially the United States, but being underweight and malnourished is unhealthy in other ways.Many teens struggle with eating disorders like bulimia and anorexia, or unhealthy habits like over-exercising to lose weight.If you’re struggling with body image issues, seek help.


Do you avoid eating even when you’re hungry because you’re afraid to gain weight? Do you make yourself throw up after eating, use laxatives, or exercise more than one hour 5 days a week? Have you stopped having your period because you’ve lost so much weight? Eating disorders are serious and often require professional help – teens with eating disorders are more likely to get sick, die from complications, or commit suicide.For help, talk to your doctor, family, friends, school counselor, coach – anyone you trust. No one who cares about you will judge you; they’ll just want to get you help. Research symptoms and support online in your community., It’s common for teens to struggle with questions of sexuality and identity, so don’t feel alone. You might realize you’re gay, bisexual, or an alternate sexuality. Being gay isn’t a disease or something you choose to be – it’s the way you’re born.Embrace what makes you you, educate yourself about your questions, and get support from loved ones and professionals if you need it.


It might feel like a struggle to tell other people you're not heterosexual, depending on your culture, values, or fear of others’ response. Confide in a parent, friend, counselor, doctor, coach, or other person you trust. You will feel relieved and happy to be yourself, and can start to explore intimate relationships with those who interest you.
Some teens struggle with gender and identity issues – feeling like you were born as a girl but inside really feel like a boy. This is usually called being transgender, or just trans. It can be very helpful to work with a therapist or counselor who specializes in questions of gender, and stick with supportive friends and family as you learn about yourself.

, Many teens struggle with depression, anxiety, abuse, and other troubling concerns.Family problems, physical or sexual abuse, and mental health issues might make you think about self-harm or suicide.You are not alone, and it can get better!


If you are thinking about hurting yourself, talk to someone you trust immediately.

Know that bigger isn’t always better.,
Look for padding and secure straps.,
Pick packs with more pockets.,
Consider the pros and cons of wheeled backpacks.,
Weigh the full backpack.,
Weed out unnecessary stuff.,
Balance the load.,
Ensure a snug and secure fit.,
Don’t carry everything all the time.,
Avoid carrying a backpack on one shoulder.,
Know the most common hazards.",How to Avoid Backpack Injuries in Kids," Just like a purse, wallet, trunk, or garage, the bigger a backpack is, the more stuff will be piled into it (and the heavier it will be). Forget about logos, designs, or brand names, and choose a well-constructed, age-appropriate pack that is the right size for your child. If that means doing the bag shopping without the kid, so be it.If you can’t cinch the straps tight enough to stay snugly over the shoulders, or if the backpack sags well below the waistline when worn, it is probably too big for your child.;
, A backpack that has padded straps and a padded back (that is, the side that makes contact with the kid’s back) will be more comfortable and may help prevent pinched nerves in the neck area. Choose models with waist straps as well, as these help to ensure better weight distribution and pack stability.Check that the straps are made of strong material, are well attached to the bag, and have sturdy but easy-to-operate buckles. Leather straps, for instance, might be more fashionable, but often simply add more weight without adding strength. Check a backpack in use for frayed straps, ripped canvas, or broken buckles.

, Backpacks that have one giant pocket are more prone to be overloaded with an assortment of books and who-knows-what-else. Alternatively, packs with more compartments and pockets can help reduce the overall max load and ensure that the pack’s weight is less prone to shifting out of balance, which can cause falls or back injuries.Backpacks with more compartments and/or pockets can also help a disorganized child find what he needs more quickly.

, The proliferation of overloaded backpacks, even among young children, has led to the development of packs with wheels and telescoping handles (akin to carry-on luggage). Such packs can reduce the likelihood of back or shoulder strains, but also can increase the likelihood of trip-and-fall injuries. They also tend to be heavier than traditional backpacks, which can cause increased strain when they need to be carried.Using a bag with wheels can also put stress on the shoulder of the arm that is pulling the bag. If your child currently uses a bag with wheels, it’s best to make sure they alternate hands rather than using one hand all the time.
Some school districts ban the use of wheeled backpacks because of the increased risk of students tripping over them in the hallway or on stairs. Check your school’s policy before considering a purchase.
Indeed, tripping is the most common cause of backpack-related injuries that require emergency room visits., How do you know if you child’s backpack is too heavy? Experts tend to recommend that children not carry packs that weigh more than 10 – 20% of the child’s body weight, with 15% as a common standard maximum.Weigh your child (without the backpack), then multiply the result by 0.15. Then, weigh the loaded backpack alone. If it weighs more than your multiplied result, it’s too heavy.
For instance, say you have an 80-pound child with a 17-pound backpack. 80 x .15 = 12. Since the bag weighs more than this amount, it is too heavy (by at least five pounds).
If your child has to lean forward to hold the pack on his back, or complains of neck, shoulder, or back pain, the backpack is likely too heavy — regardless of what the scale says.

, Once you determine that a backpack is too heavy, your next task (with your child’s help) should be to take everything out and decide what must stay and what can go. Use “I have to have this in there because…” as your criteria, not “I might possibly need this sometime if…”.Remember, every little bit of weight shed helps. How many extra pencils does your child need? Does she really need that backup calculator? A lot of seemingly important stuff can actually be ditched, not to mention the superfluous stuff — toys, keepsakes, last Thursday’s unfinished lunch — that you’ll find in a kid’s backpack.
Conduct a regular “weed out” every couple of weeks or so to prevent unnecessary accumulation of stuff.

, As you refill the weeded-out and lighter backpack, pay close attention to how you fill it. Unbalanced or shifting loads can throw a smaller kid off balance easily, and are more likely to cause discomfort or injury. Put heavy items like books in first, then distribute smaller items throughout the additional compartments and pockets., In addition to reducing the overall load carried, you can also decrease the likelihood of soreness or injury by making sure that your child wears the backpack properly. The weight of the pack should be distributed primarily over the shoulders and upper back, with the chest in support — these are some of your strongest muscle groups.Straps should be snug without cutting into the shoulders. The bag portion should be centered on the mid-back, with the bottom of the bag sagging no more than four inches below the waistline. The bag should never touch the child’s backside while being worn.

, Ask your child to think of the backpack as a temporary conveyance — like a delivery truck — and not as a permanent home for her stuff — like a motor home. She should use it to carry what she needs when she needs it to where she needs it. Load and reload it frequently with what she needs right then.


Kids should use a locker and/or desk as their primary storage spaces, not their backpacks. Recommend that she make more frequent trips to lockers or desks in order to unload and reload the backpack with what she needs at that moment.Procrastination can also cause overload problems, by causing a kid have to bring all her books home on Friday, for instance. Work with her to make sure homework and assignments don’t back up to the point where everything needs to be done all at once.
It may be a long shot depending upon your school’s budget situation, but you may want to ask whether your child can have two copies of her textbooks — one for school and one for home. The adoption of e-textbooks (at least as a supplement for homework) may be a more practical and cost-effective solution., Make sure you educate your child about avoiding carrying a bag on one shoulder. Some kids may want to switch from a backpack that rests on both shoulders to one shoulder, such as a messenger bag. This can put stress on that shoulder, in addition to the child hiking his shoulder up to keep the backpack in place. This can lead to shoulder and neck pain if it is done on a regular basis.


Both shoulder straps must be used to effectively balance the load — even if slinging the pack over only one shoulder is considered “cooler.”

, Most of the prevention measures for backpack safety involve strains and injuries caused by overweight loads. However, when it comes to injuries that lead to emergency room visits, less than one-fourth involve the shoulders (12%) or back (11%), and the most common cause of significant backpack injuries is tripping over one (28%).The majority of all ER-worthy backpack injuries involve the head or face, hands, wrists, or elbows, all likely spots for trip-and-fall injuries.What does all this mean? While it is important to take precautions against your child lugging around a backpack that is too heavy, make sure she is just as vigilant about paying attention to her surroundings to avoid injuries caused by tripping over a backpack or being struck by a swinging bag, strap, buckle, etc."

Eat plenty of fruit.,
Get lots of vegetables.,
Avoid too much sugar.,
Drink lots of water.,
Have variation in your diet.,
Eat with friends and family.",How to Be a Healthy Kid1," It’s very important to have a healthy diet to help you grow and develop. Fruit should be a major part of your diet, as it will provide you with lots of the vitamins and minerals that you need to stay strong and healthy.


The recommended amount of fruit varies a little by age and gender, but you should generally aim to eat one or two cups of fruit a day.
A large banana, an apple, and a large orange, would each count as one cup of fruit.Try to have fresh fruit available around the house for an easy snack.;
, Vegetables are an essential part of your diet. Try to be aware of how much you eat, and ensure you are getting enough. The recommended amount of vegetables varies a little by age and gender, but in general you should be aiming to eat between 2 and 3 cups of vegetables each day.Vegetables come in many different types, and so you should try to get a good balance of the different sorts. This includes dark green vegetables, red and orange vegetables, beans and peas, and starchy vegetables.


Try combining fruits and vegetables with other ingredients to make delicious snacks.
Combine apples with peanut butter or honey.
Dip some carrot or celery sticks into a pot of hummus.

, Sugary snacks and drinks are a major factor in unhealthy diets for those of all ages. Kids might be especially susceptible to sweets and sugary drinks, so it’s important that you control your sugar intake to help you stay healthy. Snacks that are high in sugar and saturated fats can cause children to put on a lot of weight relatively quickly.


Limit the amount of sweets, chocolate, chips and other unhealthy snacks you eat.
Try to opt for healthier snack alternatives, such as fruit., Water is a major part of staying healthy. Drinking plenty of water provides you with lots of valuable minerals. It also quenches your thirst without all the extra sugars that most other drinks contain. Soda drinks, and even fruit juice, contain a lot of sugar which can have a detrimental effect on your health.


If you're feeling thirsty, try to choose water as much as possible. Aim to drink 8 glasses a day.Choose low fat or non-fat milk if you can.
Try to avoid having sugary drinks in the house as a rule., The key to a good balanced diet is variation and moderation. Don’t think you can only ever eat green vegetables to stay healthy, instead try and have a mixed, but healthy diet. The building blocks of your diet are fruits, vegetables, grain, proteins, and dairy foods. Try to think about all of these different groups and how you balance them out.


The US Department of Agriculture’s “myplate” website helps you to understand in what proportion you should be eating each of the different groups.
Visit the website here: http://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate


, You should try to eat healthily, but you should also enjoy your food and your mealtimes. Don't eat too quickly, and make meals into a big event. Try to eat meals at a table with friends or family so you can combine eating with talking, relaxing and having fun. Research suggests that families who eat a table, and not in front of the TV or computer, are less likely to be overweight."

Don’t drink alcohol.,
Don’t use drugs.,
Don’t smoke.,
Be cautious on the internet.,
Report bullying.,
Get educated about sex.,
Decide when you’re ready to have sex.,
Don’t be peer pressured.You should never be forced to have sex, use drugs or alcohol, or do something illegal.,
Have safe sex if you have sex.",How to Be a Healthy Teen Girl4," Drinking alcohol as a teenager can stunt your brain’s growth and development. Not only that, but studies show your binge drinking now might negatively impact the health and wellbeing of your future children.Stay away from alcohol until you’re 21 – not only to stay out of legal trouble, but so your brain can fully develop!


NEVER drink and drive, or get in the car of someone who has been drinking. If you do drink alcohol, get a ride home with somebody sober, or call a sober friend or parent for a ride. Uber and Lyft are good options, too.

, Drugs negatively affect your body and your thinking. Marijuana impairs memory and concentration. Sedatives like Valium can make you stop breathing. Stimulants like cocaine put a strain on your heart and can make you paranoid. Opioids like heroin and prescription pain-killers are incredibly addicting and can cause you life-long problems with substance abuse.Drugs might seem tempting, but they are not worth the legal, physical, and mental risks.

, Smoking is highly addicting so if you don’t smoke, don’t start.Smoking causes more preventable deaths than any other drug, and if you start now, you might find it extremely hard to quit. Smoking is bad for you even as a healthy teenager – it can increase your risk of asthma and lung infections, decrease your ability to work out, damage your teeth and give you foul breath, and make your clothes smell terrible.You may notice some benefits soon after you quit smoking, such as an improved sense of taste and smell and easier breathing after a few days., Today, everyone and everything is connected on the internet. While this can be great for keeping in touch with friends and learning about the world, it also comes with risks. Cyberbullying affects many young people.Remember also that anything you put on the internet stays there forever for anyone to see.


Never put private information online like your home address, social security number, or personal details. It’s easy for predators to take advantage of you when they know your personal info.
Don’t upload any photos of yourself doing anything illegal, or anything that you wouldn’t want your grandmother or future employer to see.

, Bullying can happen to anyone, and it may occur in person or online. Whether you experience in-person bullying or cyberbullying, it is important to report it right away.Some teens become so depressed over being bullied that they harm themselves, or lash out and harm others. It doesn’t have to be like that. Report it to your parents or a school authority right away if someone:Spreads lies or hurtful rumors about you.
Physically harms you.
Calls you names or often negatively teases you.
Makes negative comments to you about your sex, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
Calls, emails, or approaches you repeatedly after you ask them not to (this is stalking; you can even report this to the police).

, Have open and honest conversation with your parent(s), doctor, or another trusted and knowledgeable adult; you never know if what your friends and peers tell you about sex is true. Before you even think about having sex, get accurate information.


Sex can lead to an unwanted pregnancy and STIs including gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, herpes, human papilloma virus (HPV), syphilis, and HIV/AIDS.Some of these are treatable with medicine, whereas others – like herpes, HPV, and HIV – last your entire life. HPV can cause warts and cervical cancer, and HIV/AIDS shortens your life expectancy and makes you very sick.
Consider your own feelings about sex and your personal values. Why do you want to have sex? Why do you want to wait? Think about your religious and cultural views, your self-esteem, and whether or not you’re ready for the responsibility of having sex.

, When you’re “ready” is different for different people. Some people want to wait until they’re adults or until they’re married, while others feel comfortable having sex when they feel their relationship is ready for it. You should never feel pressured, bullied, or manipulated into having sex, and you shouldn’t do it just because other people are. You might know that your relationship is ready if:You and your partner trust each other and can be honest with each other.
You feel comfortable talking about things like feelings, and the risks of sex like STIs.
You are both educated about sex and can prevent pregnancy and STIs by using condoms or other birth control.
You respect each other’s needs about using protection, and not having sex until you’re both ready.

, If someone is pressuring you, try responses like these (these can work for sex, drinking, doing drugs – anything you want to adapt it to):Everybody’s doing it!: “I don’t care. I’m not everybody. And not everybody does it!”

If you loved me, you’d sleep with me.: “If you loved me, you wouldn’t pressure me to do something I don’t want to do.”

If you don’t have sex with me, I’ll break up with you.: “If being your girlfriend means I have to have sex with you, then I don’t want to be your girlfriend.”

, The only way to 100% prevent pregnancy and STIs is with abstinence – not having sex at all. However, if you choose to have sex, minimize your risks by using birth control and barrier methods to protect yourself. There are many options for birth control, from the pill, to an intrauterine device or IUD, to hormonal rings, patches, injections, and implants.The best way to choose a birth control method is to speak with your gynecologist. Be aware that these methods do not prevent STIs.


Use a new condom every time you have sex, and a new condom during the same sex act if you switch between vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Condoms only work if they are used correctly, aren’t expired, don’t break, and are removed properly. Try to use condoms with a reservoir tip.
Even oral sex can put you at risk for STIs, so always use a barrier method when contacting another person's bodily fluids, such as a dental dam, condom, or some non-microwaveable plastic wrap.The withdrawal method, or “pulling out,” isn’t effective in preventing pregnancy. Neither is the “rhythm method,” where you time unprotected sex with when you’re not ovulating. Both of these carry high risk for pregnancy and getting an STI.Get the HPV vaccine! Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9 are all approved for girls. You should get two doses of this vaccine between ages 9 and 14, 6 months apart – and definitely before you start having any vaginal, anal, or oral sex.If the condom breaks or you have another emergency, use emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy. “Plan B,” or “the morning-after pill” should NOT be used as your primary birth control method – it’s just for accidents and emergencies when other methods fail. You can get these over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Take it as soon after the accident as possible."

Try some team sports.,
Exercise on your own.,
Get an hour of exercise a day.,
Cut down on TV and internet time.",How to Be a Healthy Kid2," Getting lots of physical activity is very important for healthy growth and development in young people. Taking part in team sports can be a great way to get lots of exercise as well as being a fun way to spend time with your friends. Playing soccer, basketball, rugby, or any other intensive sport will get your blood pumping, and make you sweat and breathe hard.Playing team sports can also be a great way to relax, hang out with friends, and meet new people.
You will learn great skills in team work and communication, all whilst playing your favourite sport.

, Not everyone enjoys team sports, but that’s no reason not to get plenty of exercise. There are all sorts of exercise options that you can do on your own, or with other people, but not in a team. You could go for a run or bike ride, go swimming, or try some dancing.


Activities such as martial arts are not typically team sports, but you will train with a group of people.
Rock climbing is a great way to exercise with other people, but not in a competitive team environment.
Doing muscle-building exercises like crunches and push-ups will also help you to grow strong and stay healthy., You should try to include an hour of physical activity in your schedule every day. Incorporating exercise into your everyday life will really help you to stay healthy and strong. An hour seems like a lot, but you can break it down into smaller chunks and it will seem much easier.Playing soccer for half an hour at lunch is enough to get you halfway there.Find activities that you enjoy and you'll discover that an hour of exercise a day isn’t so difficult.

, Being active means spending less time sat in front of TV and computer screens. Research shows that kids who spend more time sat in front of screens tend to be more likely to be overweight. Try to limit the amount of time that you are sitting around, and find active and physical things to do instead.A good target is to aim not spend more than two hours a day staring at a screen."
"
Get into good hygiene habits.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Visit the doctor if you are ill.",How to Be a Healthy Kid3," An important part of staying healthy is getting into good hygiene habits. That means you should wash properly and wear clean clothes. Take the time to wash thoroughly every day, including washing your feet. As you reach puberty you might find you start to produce more smelly sweat, or body odour, and daily showers will be important.


Brush your teeth thoroughly twice and day, floss regularly, and make regular visits to your dentist.
Don’t wear dirty, smelly or and stained clothes. Put them in the wash., Getting enough sleep is a very important part of your natural development. Research has shown that sleep is just as important as a healthy diet and exercise for avoiding childhood obesity. Kids who don’t get enough sleep tend to crave sugary and starchy foods for energy during the day, which they wouldn’t if they had slept more. The amount of sleep you need will vary a little according to your age:


7 years old: 10 ½ hours a night.
8 years old: 10 ¼ hours a night.
9 years old: 10 hours a night.
10 years old: 9 ¾ hours a night.
11 years old: 9 ½ hours a night.
12-13 years old: 9 ¼ hours a night.
14-16 years old: 9 hours a night., If you have a healthy diet, and do plenty of physical activity, you will be giving yourself the best chance of staying healthy and avoiding illness. We can only lower our chances of getting ill, and we will all be ill at some point. If you do feel unwell, you should be sure to talk to your parents about it and go to see your doctor.


If you have an infection or a virus, your doctor will be able to give you medicine to tackle it.
Be sure to listen carefully to your doctor, as well as answering all the questions asked of you completely honestly.

Have fun with friends and family.,
Look for role models.,
Make time to just relax.",How to Be a Healthy Kid4," Staying healthy shouldn’t be just about monitoring what you eat, how much exercise you get, and how many hours of sleep you manage. Try to incorporate all of these elements into your life, but remember that being healthy and happy is also having fun with friends and family.


Having great friends to play and learn with will really help you to be happy and healthy.Take care of these relationships and value them.
If you begin to worry too much about your health, or be completely strict with how you live, you may end up becoming stressed and anxious.
Your health is very important, and you should protect it by finding a good balance and still allowing yourself to have plenty of fun.

, As a kid you will be spending a lot of time at school, so you should try to build strong relationships with the teachers you like and look up to. Having a good connection with a teacher can make a big difference if you are going through a tricky period at school. It's important to have role models in your life that you respect and admire.


As well as teachers, older brothers or sisters and other family members can be great role models.
A role model will help mentor you and give you some useful advice.
You don't have to agree with everything you're role model does or says. Nobody is perfect or right all the time., It’s important to be physically active, but it’s also important to give yourself a little time to just relax and take it easy. You can even combine relaxation with exercise if you try out some yoga. Reading, taking a warm bath, or just chatting with friends and family gives you time to forget about everything else for a while. It's important not to sweat the small stuff, and to give yourself a break when you need it.


Relaxation doesn’t necessarily means using the computer or playing video games, which while not physically active, do make your brain work.
Try to make time to be away from electronic screens and really relax.
Learning to relax may also help you sleep better and fit more stuff into the rest of the day."
"
Exercise regularly.,
Get rest.,
Drink fluids.",How to Digest Food Faster1," Increased physical activity helps keep food moving through the digestive system. This can increase the speed with which food is digested, and assist in the overall digestive process.


Exercise can prevent constipation and increase the speed of digestion by decreasing the amount of time food stays in the large intestine, thereby limiting the amount of water absorbed from the stool back into the body.Movement also helps stimulate the natural contractions of the smooth muscle in the digestive tract, expediting the breakdown of food.However, it is best to wait an hour or so before exercising, in order to allow the body's natural blood supply to concentrate in the digestive system, rather than fueling the heart and other active muscles.;
, Sleep gives the digestive organs the time needed to rest and repair, increasing their ability to digest food quickly and efficiently.Making some changes to your sleep will have digestion benefits that are far-reaching.


Don't fall asleep immediately after eating, wait two to three hours to ensure your body has had adequate time to digest.
Try sleeping on your left side. Some studies have shown that sleeping on the left side increases digestive capability., Drinking fluids, especially water or tea, during or after a meal aids in digestion. Fluids help your body break down food, and water can help by hydrating you.Being hydrated is key to maintaining the appropriate levels of saliva production and fluid in the stomach.
Water also softens stool, helping prevent constipation.
Additionally, water is crucial to your body's effective use of dietary fiber, a crucial component of digestion."

Check for symptoms of esophagitis.,
Check for symptoms for gastritis.,
Check for signs of gastroparesis.,
Get emergency medical care.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid1," Acid reflux may be a symptom of a condition called esophagitis, in which the esophagus becomes inflamed, causing esophageal narrowing, damaging the tissue, and increasing the chances of choking on your food. If left untreated, esophagitis can lead to severe tissue damage and esophageal cancer. Common symptoms are heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain that occurs while eating.A cold, flu, or other viral infection should be treated immediately if you have acid reflux, as it can lead to increased inflammation in the food pipe. See your doctor if symptoms:Last longer than a few days or don't improve with over-the-counter antacids
Are severe enough to make eating difficult
Are accompanied by flu signs and symptoms, such as headache, fever, and muscle aches
Are accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain that occurs shortly after eating
Get emergency care if you experience pain in your chest that lasts more than a few minutes, suspect you have food lodged in your esophagus, have a history of heart disease, or have impaired immune function.;
, Heartburn may also be a symptom of gastritis. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining often caused by helicobacter pylori bacteria, which may also cause stomach ulcers. An autoimmune disorder, a backup of bile into the stomach, or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also cause gastritis.Common symptoms of gastritis include:Indigestion
Heartburn
Abdominal pain
Hiccups
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting, possibly of material that looks like ground coffee (blood)
Dark stools

, Gastroparesis is a condition in which the movement of the muscles in your stomach does not function normally, preventing your stomach from emptying properly. This can cause acid reflux and vomiting by backing up stomach acids in the esophagus.People are more likely to develop this condition if they have diabetes or recently had a surgery. Symptoms of gastroparesis include:Vomiting
Nausea
A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites
Abdominal bloating
Abdominal pain
Changes in blood sugar levels
Lack of appetite
Weight loss and malnutrition

, Heartburn, angina, and heart attack may feel very much alike. Both heartburn and a developing heart attack can cause symptoms that subside after a while. Typical heart attack signs and symptoms for which you should go to the emergency room immediately are:Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back
Nausea, indigestion, heartburn, or abdominal pain
Shortness of breath
Cold sweat
Fatigue
Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness

Eat high-fiber foods.,
Eat yogurt.,
Eat ginger.,
Choose low-fat foods and avoid fatty, fried foods.,
Choose mild foods and avoid extra spicy foods.,
Limit or avoid dairy.,
Limit or avoid red meat.",How to Digest Food Faster2," Fiber-rich foods aid digestion in a variety of ways. Eating these foods can speed digestion by reducing constipation and maintaining general bowel health.Fiber works by absorbing water, adding weight and mass to your stool. For this to work, adequate (and sometimes increased) water consumption is also needed. Otherwise, constipation can occur.
By adding bulk to your stool, these fiber-rich foods regulate digestion. This can also help reduce gas, bloating, and diarrhea.Some high-fiber foods include: whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

, Yogurt is a great natural source of probiotics, and other live cultures that are essential to digestion.The digestion benefits of yogurt are thought to come from the way that yogurt:


Encourages the growth of good bacteria, due to its naturally occurring live cultures.
Decreases the length of time it takes to recover from infections, as well as lessens the immune system response in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
Speeds the time that food takes to go through the bowel., Ginger has been used for thousands of years as a digestive aid, and its popularity has continued to the present day. Ginger is thought to stimulate the release of enzymes in the digestive tract that increase the efficiency and ease of digestion.Ginger has been shown to increase muscle contractions in the stomach, helping to move food to the upper small intestine faster., Foods high in fat and fried foods can cause acid reflux and heartburn because they overwhelm the stomach's ability to properly break down its contents.Your stomach finds these foods hard to digest, and slows the entire digestive process.Examples of high-fat and fried foods are: processed meats, french fries, ice cream, butter, and cheese.

, Spicy foods can irritate the throat and esophagus, leading to acid reflux and heartburn.Additionally, these foods can upset the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, slowing down digestion and causing diarrhea and other digestive ailments., Yogurt, in general, helps people. However, if you have any symptoms of lactose intolerance, yogurt should be avoided along with all other dairy. Although the exact mechanism by which dairy causes indigestion and constipation is unknown, it can definitely hamper the digestion process.Intolerance to lactose can cause bloating, gas, and indigestion, all of which can be the result of slowed or impaired digestion.

, Red meat can make you constipated, and prevent the regular bowel movements necessary for speedy digestion. There are a variety of reasons for the negative effect of red meat on digestion.


Red meat is high in fat, so the body takes longer to process it.
Red meat is rich in iron, which can also lead to constipation.

Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day.,
Choose whole foods over processed foods.,
Chew your food well.",How to Digest Food Faster3," Rather than overburdening your digestive system with a large meal, eat smaller meals throughout the day to help speed your digestion. Aim for 4-5 evenly spaced small meals throughout the day. Try to eat every three hours to prevent excessive hunger., Foods that are highly processed are more difficult for your body to digest. Instead, choose whole foods that are not full of preservatives, additives, and other chemicals. Eat fruits, vegetables, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, beans, nuts, seeds, and other whole foods throughout the day to ease the digestive process and help make it more efficient., Chewing starts the engine of the digestive train, but is often under-emphasized. Proper chewing multiplies the surface area of the food particles many times and allows your enzymes to access more of the food you have put into your body. Exposing huge surface areas of food to your saliva is a great start in achieving smooth, efficient digestion."

Take bitters.",How to Digest Food Faster4," Probiotics are bacteria that help maintain the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestines.There are some indications that consuming additional probiotics in supplement form can aid in digestion by bolstering the amount of beneficial bacteria found in the intestines. Probiotics are also in many different types of foods, so if you’d rather not take a supplement, you can get the benefits of probiotics by incorporating probiotic foods into your diet.


Since the FDA does not regulate probiotic supplements as a drug, there are certain things that you should look for when choosing a probiotic supplement. Make sure that you can find the following information on the label:genus, species, and strain of the probiotic (such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG)
number of organisms that will be alive by the use-by date
dose
company name and contact information


The types of different probiotic strains within the supplement are vary important. Some people react to certain bacteria strains better than others. For this reason, a probiotic with several different strains should be chosen.

, Over-the-counter digestive enzymes may aid in digestion by supplementing the body's naturally occurring enzymes. Enzymes break down food into its component parts, allowing the body to absorb it more easily. If these enzymes are effective, they could aid in the efficiency and speed of the digestive process.


Digestive enzymes are created by four glands in the human body, primarily the pancreas.Although some alternative healthcare specialists and producers of nutritional supplements argue for the benefits of enzyme supplements, many doctors say more human studies are necessary to determine their potential effects.Some commonly sold supplements are:

Lipase. Lipase aids in the digestion and absorption of fat.Papain. Papain is said to be useful in the digestion of proteins.Lactase. Lactase aids in the digestion of lactose, the protein found in dairy products. Individuals who have low natural levels of lactase are considered lactose-intolerant., Bitters are tinctures (often alcoholic) derived from a variety of herbs, bark, and roots, that are thought to aid in digestion. Alcohol can act as a solvent for the botanical extract and helps to preserve it. Taking bitters before, with, or after a meal can aid in speeding digestion.However, bitters are not proven to have a positive effect on digestion, and there has been very limited research done on their efficacy.

Get enough sleep.,
Sleep on your side.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Avoid stretching or bending after meals.,
Chew food thoroughly.,
Quit smoking.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid2," Not getting enough sleep can increase the production of stress hormones, which can trigger acid reflux, put you at higher risk for chronic diseases, and lower life expectancy. If you suffer from sleep apnea or insomnia, talk to your doctor for possible treatments.


Strategies for getting enough sleep include a quiet, dark, cool environment and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and sugary foods for 4-6 hours before bed. You should also avoid eating 2-3 hours before bed and work or exercise 3-4 hours before bed.For more info on getting enough sleep, check: How to Sleep Better


, Sleeping on your stomach or lying flat on your back right after a meal can promote stomach acids, causing indigestion and heartburn. Try sleeping on your left side with a firm pillow between your knees to prevent stress on your spine, hips, and lower back.Some studies show that sleeping on the left side limits the flow of stomach acid into the esophagus by supporting the body’s natural curves.Pull your knees up slightly toward your chest. The pillow for your head should keep your spine straight. A rolled towel or small pillow under your waist may also help support your spine.If you have a respiratory condition or cold, try to prop your head up on a pillow to improve airflow. The pillow for your head should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable.A pillow that's too high can put your neck into a position that causes muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. This can increase stress, cause headaches and trigger acid reflux. Choose a pillow that will keep the neck aligned with the chest and lower back.

, The type of clothing you wear can affect your acid reflux, especially if you’re overweight. Tight clothing can increase pressure in your abdominal area, which can force the contents of your stomach back up into your esophagus. Be sure to wear comfortable, loose fitting clothing., In general, you should avoid exercising for at least 2–4 hours after eating. If you frequently have acid reflux or heartburn, even slight bending, stretching or climbing stairs can promote stomach acids. Gently paced walking, in contrast, helps reduce stomach acids and aids digestion., Chewing your food thoroughly makes it easier to swallow and digest, thus reducing or preventing symptoms of heartburn. It also increases nutrient absorption by releasing food enzymes and may help promote weight loss by reducing appetite.If you have dental issues that make it difficult to chew, ask your dentist about how to chew properly while taking care of your oral health.

, Studies suggest that smoking increases acid secretion, impairs muscle reflexes in the throat, and damages protective mucus membranes. Smoking reduces salivation, and saliva helps neutralize acid.It is unknown whether the smoke, nicotine, or both trigger GERD. Some people who use nicotine patches to quit smoking, for example, have heartburn, but it is not clear whether the nicotine or stress produces the acid backup.
In addition, smoking can lead to emphysema, a condition in which the air sacs of the lungs are damaged and enlarged, causing breathlessness.

Drink plenty of water.,
Keep a food journal.,
Eat smaller, healthier meals.,
Avoid foods that increase stomach acids.,
Eat nutritious foods.,
Eat more select fruits.,
Use healthy cooking oil.,
Use probiotics.,
Avoid using garlic and onions.,
Avoid drinking alcohol.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid3," Water has a neutral pH, which can help neutralize stomach acids and help your body absorb nutrients easily. Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. Two liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. Alkaline water with a pH of 8.8 may be more beneficial for people with severe symptoms of heartburn and GERD.If you drink caffeinated beverages, drink one liter of water for every cup (one fluid oz.) of caffeine.
Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration. Dehydration can cause headaches, irritability, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help alleviate dehydration as well., There is no one specific diet that will prevent all symptoms of heartburn and GERD. The only way for your doctor to design a meal plan appropriate for you is to discover which foods you tolerate well and which foods aggravate your reflux. Try to keep a detailed food record for one or two weeks. Your food record may have three categories:


The type and quantity of food or beverages, such as one cup orange juice. Note any spices you may have used in your meals as well.
Time of day
Symptoms and the severity of the condition, such as mild acid reflux.

, Eating 5-6 small meals each day aids digestion, promotes weight loss and increases energy levels without causing acid reflux.Ask your doctor about your recommended daily calorie intake to manage your weight while eating healthier meals. Other ways you can practice portion control to eat smaller meals are:Split large entrées with a friend instead of eating it all, or box half the meal to take with you.
Control snack portion by placing an exact amount into a bowl instead of eating from the box.
Serve food on individual plates, and keep serving dishes in the kitchen to reduce the temptation of additional servings.
People tend to consume more when they have easy access to food. Move the healthier food to the front of the fridge and cabinets, and keep less healthy options out of sight.

, Refined carbohydrates, fried and processed foods, sugary beverages, red meat, hydrogenated oils, and margarine can increase inflammation in the esophagus.High-fat meals and fried foods also tend to decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and delay stomach emptying, thereby increasing the risk of reflux.


Chili peppers and black pepper contain compounds such as capsaicin and piperine, which can increase stomach acid production and should be avoided. However, sweet bell peppers are safe as they do not contain these compounds.
Chocolate should also be avoided as it contains methylxanthine, a compound that relaxes the LES, allowing stomach acid to back up into the esophagus.
Your doctor can help you create a personalized meal plan if you are allergic to certain foods or if you experience bloating and indigestion due to acid reflux.

, Many healthy options do not encourage stomach acid production, reduce inflammation in the esophagus and stomach, and provide you with necessary nutrients to support various bodily functions. These foods also have the added benefit of helping you maintain a healthy weight and a high fiber content that promotes the digestive system. However, too much fiber can slow down stomach emptying in people who have gastroparesis. Ask your doctor or a dietician to help you come up with a meal plan that is right for you. In general, you should try to eat more:Green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants and plant fiber.
Artichokes to aid digestion.
Sweet bell peppers, which are high in vitamin C.
Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal, and flax seed.
Dried beans and lentils. Canned varieties should be avoided as they have a high sodium content and may have additives such as animal saturated fat and sugar, which can contribute to a variety of diseases.
Lean poultry such as turkey, quail and chicken.
Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines.
Nuts such as almonds or walnuts.

, While fruits and tomatoes are beneficial to your health, the citric acid in these foods may increase the risk for heartburn and GERD. Eating non-citrus fruits may help reduce stomach acids. Try apples, bananas, cucumbers, and watermelon., Some vegetable oils such as flaxseed, canola, olive, and soybean are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids that help prevent heartburn by neutralizing stomach acids and coating the esophagus to reduce inflammation.Rice bran oil is often used to help relieve symptoms of acid reflux.
You can also use these oils as salad dressings.

, Probiotics are naturally occurring bacteria found in our stomach that help promote digestive health, boost the immune system, and help fight inflammation.Probiotics can be found in yogurt, certain types of milk, soy products, and as dietary supplements.Eat yogurt or take a probiotic supplement on an empty stomach with 4-6 oz. of water. You can also twist or cut the capsule and empty the powdered bacteria into a glass, add the water and a teaspoon of soda bicarbonate to neutralize the stomach acid.
You should consult your doctor before taking probiotics if you have a weakened immune system or are currently taking immunosuppressant drugs.

, While garlic and onions do not cause acid reflux, studies have found that they may aggravate symptoms for people who regularly experience acid reflux and heartburn. They may increase the acidity of meals, thus triggering reflux.Garlic and onions have been found beneficial for many heart and respiratory conditions, therefore may be used in moderation and smaller doses for people with other conditions to avoid triggering acid reflux.

, While moderate consumption of alcohol helps improve heart and digestive health, it may cause inflammation and damage to the esophagus for people with symptoms of heartburn, esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.Most experts have found that drinking alcohol, especially large quantities, increases the risk of GERD. Any form of alcohol such as beer, wine, or spirit may cause acid reflux and should be avoided. Try to limit your intake to one glass per week."

Drink chamomile tea.,
Use slippery elm.,
Use ginger.,
Use baking soda.,
Chew gum.,
Avoid using peppermint or spearmint.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid4," Though used as a remedy for indigestion for thousands of years, research into the effects of chamomile on humans is sparse. Animal studies have found that German chamomile reduces inflammation.An analysis of several studies found that combinations of the herb iberis, peppermint, and chamomile may help relieve indigestion symptoms.To make chamomile tea, steep 2-4 grams of dried chamomile flowers in 1 cup of hot water. Drinking highly concentrated chamomile can induce nausea and vomiting, so make sure not to infuse the tea longer than five minutes.
Chamomile is also available as a dietary supplement at most drug stores. If you are allergic to asters, daisies, chrysanthemums, or ragweed, you may also be allergic to chamomile.Ask your doctor before using chamomile if you are taking medication for diabetes, blood pressure or sedatives.

, Slippery elm bark contains mucilage, a substance that becomes a slick gel when mixed with water, which coats the esophagus, stomach, and intestinal lining to reduce irritation and acid reflux. The antioxidants in slippery elm also help protect against stomach ulcers and inflammation.Slippery elm bark is available as capsules, lozenges, teas, and powdered extracts at most pharmacies and nutrition stores.You should take slippery elm two hours before or after other herbs or medications you may be taking as it can slow down the absorption of other medications.To make slippery elm tea, steep 1–2 g (approx. 1 tablespoon) of powdered bark extract in 1 cup of boiling water for 3–5 minutes. Drink up to 3 times per day or as recommended by your doctor.
The recommended dose for slippery elm capsules is 400-500 mg at least 3-4 times daily, for 4–8 weeks or until your condition improves. Take with a full glass of water.Do not give slippery elm to a child without consulting your doctor first., Research suggests that taking 1–2 grams of raw ginger or ginger root powder at least one hour before meals can help aid gastric emptying, thus reducing symptoms of heartburn and GERD.Ginger can also help reduce symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and inflammation caused by acid backing up in the esophagus. Ginger root is widely available at most grocery stores.


Ginger tea can also be made by steeping 1–2 grams of peeled ginger in 1 cup of boiling water for 5 minutes. Strain and drink up to 2 times daily, at least 1 hour before meals.
Ask your doctor before taking ginger if you have diabetes, heart conditions, bleeding disorders, or if you are currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Tell your doctor about any other medications, herbs, or supplements you may be using to avoid side effects.

, Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is often used as a natural antacid to help neutralize stomach acids and help digestion.Baking soda is available as both oral tablets and powder, which can be used up to four times daily at least 1–2 hours after having meals or other medications. Avoid taking sodium bicarbonate on an overly full stomach.Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda into a glass of water until it dissolves completely and drink it to neutralize stomach acid. Measure powdered doses carefully using a measuring spoon. Add honey or lemon for taste if you want.
Check with your doctor before using baking soda If you are on a sodium-restricted diet, have other heart or digestive conditions, or are currently using other medications, herbs, and supplements.
Take sodium bicarbonate exactly as directed. Do not use sodium bicarbonate for longer than two weeks unless your doctor tells you to. Baking soda should not be given to children under twelve years of age.Take the miss doses as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose. Then skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule., Chewing a piece of sugar-free gum for half an hour after a meal can reduce heartburn, as it stimulates the production of saliva.Saliva is alkaline, so swallowing saliva neutralizes stomach acid.Sugar-free gum additionally contains xylitol, which inhibits bacteria that cause tooth decay.
Sugary gum can thicken saliva causing a dry mouth and may not be as beneficial as sugar-free gum.
Avoid mint-flavored gum as it can stimulate acid reflux.

, Peppermint can relax the sphincter between the stomach and esophagus, allowing stomach acids to flow back into the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is the muscle that separates the esophagus from the stomach. By relaxing the sphincter, peppermint may actually make the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion worse.While spearmint does not cause reflux, it may promote mucus and postnasal drip, especially if you have a cold, that can cause irritation in the esophagus."
"
Start by emptying your colostomy bag.If there is urine or feces in your colostomy bag, it is important to empty these prior to changing the bag.,
Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and water.,
Gently take the pouch off.,
Check your skin.The skin may be a little pink or red.,
Clean your stoma.,
Try using a skin barrier, such as stoma powder.,
Prepare the new pouch.,
Put baby oil in the bag.,
Place the flange over the stoma.,
Know when to change your colostomy bag.,
Obtain the proper equipment.,
Remove your shirt and gather your supplies.",How to Change a Colostomy Bag," The best place to do this is in the bathroom. Open the bottom of the bag over the toilet. For feces, you can gently squeeze it out of the bag; urine will automatically flow from the bag when it is opened.


Alternatively, some colostomy bags have liners and flanges that are designed to be flushed down the toilet. If the bag you are using has a biodegradable flange and inner liner, place them in the bowl and flush. The outer layer remains clean. It can be placed in a purse or pocket until you can dispose of it.;
, If this is not possible, use antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.Place a clean bath towel on your lap and stuff the top of it into your pants to protect your clothing. Proper hygiene is important when changing your colostomy bag.

, Holding your skin with one hand, slowly ease the pouch off using the built in tab for easier removal. If necessary, carefully use an adhesive remover to remove the flange., However, if it is black, purple, or blue, or looks concerning to you, see a medical professional for advice. Also check your stoma in general — stoma should always be beefy red in color, never dusky. If it is changing in size, going further into or out of your skin, leaking pus or blood, or looks pale or bluish, contact your doctor immediately.

, Using warm water and a dry wipe with mild soap on it, gently wipe around the stoma. Do not rub.Only use soaps that do not contain any oils or fragrances. Use a dry wipe to pat the skin dry.


If necessary, use a measuring card device (given to your by your doctor or nurse) to measure the size of your stoma. You will need to know its size, if you don't already, before attaching a new colostomy bag.Also be sure to wash your hands one more time before putting on the new pouch. This will ensure optimum sanitization of the new pouch, as you will not want any contamination with old fecal matter.

, This is optional; however, many people use it as a means to not only protect the skin but also to provide the perfect base for the new colostomy bag to adhere to. Sprinkle stoma powder around the stoma. Be careful not to put the powder on the stoma itself. Carefully dust it around using a dry wipe, and let the area dry for about 60 seconds.

, The stoma pouch flange may need to be modified to fit your stoma properly. If this is the case, use special scissors to cut out the circle on the flange.The circle should be approximately ⅛ of an inch larger than the stoma itself. Some flanges have pre-printed guides to help you with this task.
Cut the flange to fit your stoma.
This is a process that takes time to master. Often times, on-call nurses can answer questions or help solve problems and/or decide if you need to be seen or if the problem can be solved with phone consultation.

, Carefully, without getting the baby oil on anything else, place a few drops of baby oil in the bag.


This is helpful when the time comes to empty stool from your bag. The baby oil keeps the stool from sticking to the bag.
Purchasing (or reusing) a bottle with an eyedropper may be very helpful for this task.

, Begin pressing on the part of the flange located underneath the stoma, gently moving to the sides and then to the top. Once adhered, begin smoothing the flange to remove the creases. Doing this helps to form a tighter seal around the stoma.Start in the center (near the stoma) and then move toward the outer edges. All creases must be smoothed; otherwise, the colostomy bag could leak.
When you change the baseplate for a two-piece closed colostomy pouch, you will need to use the stoma paste or a ring seal as the adhesive.
Hold the flange for about 45 seconds. The warmth of your hands helps the adhesive stick to the skin.

, The frequency with which you need to change it is patient-specific and may depend on which type of bag you are using.For people with one-piece pouches, the entire colostomy bag will need to be changed each time; on the other hand, for people with two-piece pouches, the pouch itself can be changed as frequently as one desires, while the flange will only need to be changed every two to three days.


You should never go longer than seven days between changing of the colostomy bag and appliance.
Note that this is just a guideline. Always follow the specific instructions from your doctor or nurse as to how frequently to change your colostomy bag.

, When being sent home, the ostomy nurse will ensure that you have supplies to bring home as well as information to receive specific supplies once you run out as well as information as to where to obtain new supplies. Many medical supply stores will deliver the colostomy supplies straight to your doorstep, making it very convenient to obtain all that you need.


After discharge you will be responsible for ordering your own supplies.
Be sure that you have plenty of supplies stored, so that you will not find yourself short-handed equipment-wise when you go to change your colostomy bag.

, Remove your shirt to keep it from getting in your way while you are changing your colostomy bag. Before you begin, make sure all of your supplies are within easy reach.Supplies generally include:


A new pouch
A clean towel
Skin wipes or cleaning supplies
Scissors
A measuring card and pen
A skin barrier such as stoma powder (optional)
Adhesive material (normally stoma paste or a ring seal).

Eat foods to reduce bloating.,
Cook your fruits and vegetables.,
Incorporate herbs into your diet.,
Avoid problem foods.,
Drink lots of water.,
Avoid certain beverages.",How to Relieve Bloating With Food1," There are certain foods that can help you relieve or prevent bloating. These are typically foods that contain nutrients that reduce swelling and help digestion. If you have issues with bloating, add these foods into your diet more every day in any way you can, such as in recipes or as a snack. These foods include:


Cucumber, which removes accumulated pockets of old waste materials and chemical toxins, and also prevents constipationPotassium rich foods, such as bananas, avocadoes, oranges, pistachios, and kiwis, which help reduce bloating caused by salt-related water retentionPapaya, which contains papain, a substance that helps break down proteins in your intestinal tract to aid in digestionPineapple, which contains bromelain, a substance that help reduce inflammation and treat indigestionProbiotics, found in Greek and other yogurts as well as over the counter supplements, which help with digestion and gas reduction;
, Raw fruits and vegetables, especially cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale, often cause gas and bloating. However, raw vegetables and fruits typically provide the best nutrients, whereas cooking them can destroy some nutrients. To find a happy medium, try sautéing, steaming, or baking your vegetables and fruits instead of boiling them.


Just make sure you don’t cook them too long, so you can avoid cooking too many nutrients out of them.
Some nutrients are actually increased when certain foods are cooked. For example, tomatoes have more carotenoids when they’re cooked., There are some herbs that can help reduce gas and indigestion, which can lead to bloating. These herbs include ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, fennel seeds, dill, basil, oregano, sage, tarragon, peppermint, and rosemary.


You can use these herbs normally in any meal, or you can try finding new recipes that incorporate them.
You can also make an herbal tea from them by steeping one teaspoon of dried herb or three tablespoons of fresh herbs in one cup of boiled water for five minutes. Avoid overly hot or spicy herbs, such as cayenne or black pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mustard, or horseradish. These herbs can stimulate the release of excess stomach acid, which can cause irritation.

, There are some foods that are known to consistently cause bloating issues for many people. These foods should be avoided if you want to prevent bloating or if you are already bloated. If you really enjoy these foods, eat them in small amounts to cut down on the chance of bloating. These problem foods include:


Foods containing raffinose, which is a complex sugar found in many cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower and in beansFoods containing sorbitol, which is a sugar found naturally in fruits including apples, pears, peaches, and prunes, and is also used as an artificial sweetener in many dietetic foods and sugarfree candies and gumsFoods containing soluble fiber, which slows digestion and is often found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, some fruits and vegetables, and in psyllium, a common fiber supplementFoods containing insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to stool and can be found in cellulose, wheat bran, and whole grain, Large amounts of water can help flush out your system, which can help lower your gas level and keep bloating down. It also help you digest your food better, which will also make your stomach feel better.


This can also help with constipation, which often causes bloating., There are certain drinks that can cause bloating and stomach discomfort. These can make your stomach upset, cause bloating, or make your bloating worse. Avoid acidic beverages such as alcohol, coffee, black or green tea, and fruit juices.


Beverages of extreme temperature, either cold or hot, should also be avoided to help avoid bloating. "

Understand the causes.,
Visit with your doctor to learn more.",How to Stop Hyperventilating1," It may be the case that even during an episode of hyperventilation a person may be unaware that they are over-breathing. Since most cases of hyperventilation are caused by fear, anxiety, or panic it may be difficult to notice specific symptoms. Pay careful attention to your symptoms during such states to see if they are indicative of hyperventilation.Fast or increased rate of breathing.
Confusion, dizziness, and light-headedness may be present during hyperventilation.
Weakness, numbness or tingling in the arms or mouth, and muscle spasms in the hands and feet can also occur with hyperventilation.
Palpitations and chest pain may be noticeable during hyperventilation.;
, The main causes of hyperventilation are states of panic or anxiety which increase the rate of breathing in a person. This over-breathing results in unusually low levels of carbon dioxide in the body. Altering these carbon dioxide levels cause the typical symptoms that come with hyperventilating.Hyperventilation can also be done at will, purposefully over-breathing.
Some medical issues such as infection, blood loss, or heart and lung disorders can cause hyperventilation.

, To accurately and safely diagnose hyperventilation you will need to speak with your doctor to learn more. Your doctor will be able to help you discover the causes, triggers, and best treatment plans related to your own unique case.If your hyperventilation is caused by anxiety or panic attacks your doctor can help you with these issues directly.

Drink more water.,
Eat more fiber.,
Eat prunes.,
Avoid cheese and dairy products.,
Consume bulking agents.,
Take castor oil.,
Take magnesium.",How to Relieve Constipation Quickly and Naturally1," Hard, dry stools are a common cause of constipation, so the more water you add, the easier it will be to pass the stool. It’s especially important to drink more water when you increase the fiber in your diet.Men should aim to drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluid per day. Women should aim for at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluid per day.Avoid caffeinated and alcoholic beverages while you’re experiencing constipation. Caffeinated beverages like coffee and sodas, as well as alcohol, are diuretics. Diuretic dehydrate your body by causing fluid loss through increased urination. This may make constipation worse.Other fluids, such as juices, clear broths, and herbal teas are good sources of fluid. Avoid caffeinated teas. Pear and apple juices are mild natural laxatives.;
, Fiber is a natural laxative. It increases the water content of your stool and helps bulk it up. This will help your bowel movement move more quickly and smoothly through your colon.Abruptly changing your fiber intake can cause gas and bloating, so gradually increase your dietary fiber intake over a few meals. Experts recommend that you get at least 20 to 35 grams of dietary fiber each day.Fiber can reduce how much of your medications your body absorbs. Take medication at least one hour before eating fiber or two hours afterward.Some good choices for increasing your fiber intake include:Berries and other fruits, especially those with an edible skin, such as apples and grapes.
Dark, leafy green vegetables like collard, mustard, and beet greens, as well as Swiss chard.
Other vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, carrots, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, artichokes and green beans.
Beans and other legumes such as kidney, navy, garbanzo, pinto, lima, and white beans, as well as lentils and black-eyed peas.
Whole, unprocessed grains. An easy rule of thumb is that if it is a light color or white, it has probably been processed. Go for whole grains such as brown rice, popcorn, steel-cut oats, and barley. If you are eating cereal, read the label to make sure your choice is high in fiber. Look for bread with whole-grain, unbleached, unenriched flour.Seeds and nuts such as pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds,as well as almonds, walnuts and pecans.



, Prunes are high in fiber. They also contain sorbitol, a stool-loosening sugar that naturally helps relieve constipation.Sorbitol is a mild colonic stimulant that helps reduce the transit time of stool and decreases the risk of constipation.


If you don't like the wrinkly texture or unique taste of prunes, you can try prune juice. However, prune juice has less fiber than prunes.
100 grams of prunes have 14.7 grams of sorbitol. while 100 grams of prune juice has 6.1 grams of sorbitol. You will have to drink more prune juice to achieve the same health benefits, and you will also take in additional sugars.Don’t go overboard with prune consumption. Prunes should start working within a few hours. It’s important to let one serving or glass of juice pass through your intestines before attempting to consume another, or you may risk diarrhea.

, Cheese and dairy products usually contain lactose, which many people are very sensitive to. This lactose can cause gas, bloating, and constipation for some people. If you’re having trouble with constipation, cut cheese, milk, and most other dairy products out of your diet until you’re feeling better.


The exception to this is yogurt, especially yogurt containing live probiotics. Yogurt that contains probiotics such as Bifidobacterium longum or Bifidobacterium animalis has been shown to promote more frequent and less painful stool passing., There are several mild herbs that have a laxative effect and soften stool. These include psyllium, flaxseed, and fenugreek. You can often find these supplements in capsule, tablet, and powder form at health food stores and some pharmacies. Some may also be available as teas. Take these bulking agents with plenty of water.Psyllium comes in many forms, including powder and caplets. It is also the active ingredient in commercial preparations such as Metamucil. Psyllium may cause gas or cramping in some people.Flaxseed is used for constipation and diarrhea. Flaxseed provides fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. You can stir flaxseeds into yogurt or cereals.Flaxseed is not recommended for people who have bleeding disorders, intestinal obstructions, or high blood pressure. Do not take flaxseed if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.Fenugreek is used for several digestive ailments, including upset stomach and constipation.Fenugreek is likely unsafe to use if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Do not give fenugreek to young children., When you are constipated, castor oil can help stimulate your intestines. It can also lubricate your bowels so the stool may slip out more easily.Castor oil is generally considered safe. However, you should take only the recommended dosage. You should consult your doctor if you have appendicitis or intestinal blockage. Do not use castor oil if you are pregnant.Castor oil can cause a variety of rare but unpleasant side effects if you take too much. An overdose of castor oil can cause abdominal cramps, dizziness, fainting, nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, shortness of breath, chest pain, and tightness in the throat. Contact Poison Control or your emergency medical services if you have taken too much castor oil.Be aware that fish oil may cause constipation. Unless recommended by your doctor, do not take fish oil supplements for constipation., Magnesium can be very effective in relieving constipation. It helps to draw water into the bowel and soften the stool so it can move through your intestines.Consult with your doctor before taking magnesium supplements, as it can interact with medications such as antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and blood pressure medications.In addition to dietary sources, such as broccoli and legumes, there are several other ways to take magnesium.


You can take magnesium by adding a teaspoon (or 10-30 grams) of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) to 6-8 ounces of water. Mix well and drink. This mixture can taste unpleasant to some people.
Magnesium citrate is available in tablets and oral suspensions. Take the recommended dosage as marked on the package (or as recommended by a doctor or pharmacist). Drink a full glass of water with each dose.Magnesium hydroxide, also known as milk of magnesia, is also effective at treating constipation.

, When you are preparing to read an x-ray make sure you have all the information on the patient, including age and sex, and their medical history. Remember to compare with old x-rays if there are any., Make special note of the date when comparing older radiographs (always look at older radiographs if available).

, Chest x-rays are generally taken when the patient is in the inspiratory phase of the respiration cycle, in layman's termed having breathed in. This has an important effect on the quality of the x-ray. When the x-ray beams pass through the anterior chest onto the film, it is the ribs closest to the film, the posterior ribs, that are the most apparent. You should be able to view ten posterior ribs if it was taken under full inspiration.


If you can see 6 anterior ribs, then the film is of a very high standard., Overexposed films look darker than normal, and fine details are very difficult to see. Underexposed films look whiter than normal, and cause the appearance of areas of opacification. Look for intervertebral bodies in a properly penetrated chest x-ray.


An under-penetrated chest x-ray cannot differentiate the vertebral bodies from the intervertebral spaces.
It is under penetrated if you can't see the thoracic vertebrae.An over-penetrated film shows the intervertebral spaces very distinctly.

, If the patient was not completely flat against the cassette, there may be some rotation evident on the x-ray. If this has happened the mediastinum can look very unusual. You can check for rotation by looking at clavicular heads and thoracic vertebral bodies.Check that the thoracic spine aligns in the centre of the sternum and between the clavicles.
Check if the clavicles are level., The next thing to do is identify the position of the x-ray and align it correctly. Check for the relevant markers printed on the radiograph. 'L' for Left, 'R' for Right, 'PA' for posteroanterior, 'AP' for anteroposterior, etc. Note the position of the patient: supine (lying flat), upright, lateral, decubitus. Check for and mentally notate each side of the chest x-ray.

, A normal chest x-ray will consist of both posteroanterior (PA) and lateral films which are read together. Align them so they are viewed as if the patient were standing in front of you, so their right side would be facing your left.If there are old films available you should hang these adjacent.
The term posteroanterior (PA) refers to the direction of the x-ray traversing the patient from posterior to anterior, from back to front.
The term antero-posterior (AP) refers to the direction of the x-ray traversing the patient from anterior to posterior, from front to back.
The lateral chest radiograph is taken with the patient's left side of chest held against the x-ray cassette.
An oblique view is a rotated view in between the standard front view and the lateral view. It is useful in localizing lesions and eliminating superimposed structures.

, Sometimes AP x-rays are taken, but usually only for patients who are too ill to stand up straight for the PA x-ray. AP radiographs are generally taken at shorter distance from the film compared to PA radiographs. Distance diminishes the effect of beam divergence and the magnification of structures closer to the x-ray tube, such as the heart.Since AP radiographs are taken from shorter distances, they appear more magnified and less sharp compared to standard PA films.
An AP film can show magnification of the heart and a widening of the mediastinum., An x-ray from this view is taken with the patient lying down on the side. It helps to assess suspected fluid (pleural effusion), and demonstrate whether the effusion is loculated or mobile.You can look at the non-dependent hemithorax to confirm a pneumothorax.


The dependant lung should increase in density. This is due to atelectasis from the weight of the mediastinum putting pressure on it.
If this doesn't happen it is an indicator of air trapping., You need to make sure you are looking at it the right way. You can do this easily and quickly by looking for the gastric bubble. The bubble should be on the left.Assess the amount of gas and location of the gastric bubble.
Normal gas bubbles may also be seen in the hepatic and splenic flexures of the colon.

, Before you go on to focus on the specific details, it's good practice to take an overview. The major things that you might have skipped over may change the baseline normals you adopt as reference points. Beginning with this overview may also sensitize to look for particular things. Technicians often use what is called the ABCDE method: check the airway (A), bones (B), cardiac silhouette (C), diaphragm (D) and lung fields and everything else (E).

,, Check to see if the airway is patent and midline.For example, in a tension pneumothorax, the airway is deviated away from the affected side. Look for the carina, where the trachea bifurcates (divides) into the right and left main stem bronchi.

, Look for any fractures, lesions, or defects. Note the overall size, shape, and contour of each bone, density or mineralization (osteopenic bones look thin and less opaque), cortical thickness in comparison to medullary cavity, trabecular pattern, presence of any erosions, fractures, lytic or blastic areas. Look for lucent and sclerotic lesions.


A lucent bone lesion is an area of bone with a decreased density (appearing darker); it may appear punched out compared to surrounding bone.A sclerotic bone lesion is an area of bone with an increased density (appearing whiter).At joints, look for joint spaces narrowing, widening, calcification in the cartilages, air in the joint space, and abnormal fat pads.

, The silhouette sign is basically the elimination of the silhouette or loss of lung/soft tissue interface, that occurs after a mass or flood in the lung.Look at the size of the cardiac silhouette (white space representing the heart, situated between the lungs). A normal cardiac silhouette occupies less than half the chest width.


Look for water-bottle-shaped heart on PA plain film, suggestive of pericardial effusion. Get an ultrasound or chest Computed Tomography (CT) to confirm., Look for a flat or raised diaphragm. A flattened diaphragm may indicate emphysema. A raised diaphragm may indicate area of airspace consolidation (as in pneumonia) making the lower lung field indistinguishable in tissue density compared to the abdomen.The right diaphragm is normally higher than the left, due to the presence of the liver below the right diaphragm.Also look at the costophrenic angle (which should be sharp) for any blunting, which may indicate effusion (as fluid settles down)., Examine the edges of the heart; the silhouette margins should be sharp.Observe whether a radiopacity is obscuring the heart's border, in the right middle lobe and left lingula pneumonia, for example. Also, look at the external soft tissues for any abnormalities.


A heart with a diameter greater than half thoracic diameter is an enlarged heart.Note the lymph nodes, look for subcutaneous emphysema (air density below the skin), and other lesions.

, Start by checking symmetry and looking for any major areas of abnormal lucency or density. Try to train your eyes to peer through the heart and upper abdomen to the the lung posterior. You should also be examining for vascularity, and the presence of any mass or nodules.


Examine the lung fields for any infiltration, fluid, or air bronchograms.If fluid, blood, mucous, or tumor, etc. fills the air sacs, the lungs will appear radiodense (bright), with less visible interstitial markings.

, Look for nodes and masses in the hila of both lungs. On the frontal view, most of the hila shadows represent the left and right pulmonary arteries. The left pulmonary artery is always more superior than the right, making the left hilum higher.


Look for calcified lymph nodes in the hilar, which may be caused by an old tuberculosis infection."

See a doctor if necessary.,
Ask your doctor for medication recommendations.Medical treatment for GERD is broken down according to severity of symptoms.,
Discuss the option of an endoscopy.,
Be open to surgery if your doctor recommends it.Rarely, GERD symptoms don't respond to any medications, in which case you may need surgery.",How to Reduce Excess Stomach Acid1," If you make the lifestyle changes suggested above but see no change in symptoms, it's time to see a doctor. Long-term GERD can cause esophageal injury and is associated with other severe health problems. Prolonged inflammation and repeated injury can also increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer. Don't hesitate to seek medical treatment if lifestyle changes don't fix your stomach acid issues.;
, Many of medications are available over-the-counter (OTC). You should still consult your doctor to ensure a proper treatment regimen. If he or she can write you a prescription for an OTC medication, you might even be able to get it covered by insurance. Follow the dosage and timing instructions carefully for each different drug to prevent potentially severe side effects.


For mild to moderate GERD: Take antacids as needed (Tums, Maalox) to neutralize acid if your symptoms occur once weekly or less. They provide relief within minutes, but only last for about one hour. Take surface agents (sucralfate/Carafate) to protect esophageal and stomach lining and promote healing. Take histamine 2 receptor antagonists (Zantac, Pepcid) to decrease acid secretion.
For severe or frequent (2 or more episodes per week) GERD: take proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole) to prevent acid secretion in the stomach.Some of these are available OTC, and the standard dose is one pill daily for 8 weeks. Side effects include: bacterial infections and diarrhea, anemia and osteoporosis, and interactions with other medications.

, In a screening upper endoscopy, doctors use a camera on a flexible tube to look at the throat, esophagus, and stomach. During the procedure, they might take biopsies to assess inflammation, check for H. pylori (a type of bacteria), and rule out cancer.Discuss whether your symptoms call for an endoscopy with your doctor.

, One surgical approach (fundoplication) wraps the upper part of the stomach around the esophagus, then sews it in place to reinforce the esophageal opening. A second approach wraps a string of magnetized beads around the point where the esophagus meets the stomach. This closes the lower esophagus, but lets it expand when swallowing so food can get through.


Young people who will suffer from life-long GERD symptoms can also consider surgery.

Take antibiotics.,
Take your medications for the prescribed length of time.,
Get treated in the hospital.,
Have surgery if necessary.",How to Recover From Typhoid Fever1," When you are first diagnosed with typhoid fever, your doctor will figure out how far along the disease has progressed. If the disease is diagnosed in its early stages, the common treatment is with antibiotics. He will prescribe your antibiotics, which you will take for one to two weeks. Some strains of the bacteria that cause typhoid fever have become very resistant to some antibiotics. This means that your doctor will do thorough laboratory tests to come up with the best treatment plan for the particular strain you have.The type of antibiotic you are prescribed will vary depending on where you contracted the strain and if you have had it before. The most common antibiotics prescribed include Ciprofloxacin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin or azithromycin.
You may also be prescribed Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone. These medications are typically prescribes for 10 to 14 days.;
, While symptoms may clear up within a matter of days, it is of the utmost importance that you finish your antibiotic treatment. If you do not take your antibiotics for the prescribed amount of time, you run a serious risk of having the disease return or passing it to others.


Once you have finished your antibiotics, see your doctor again for a follow up test to make sure that you have gotten rid of the infection., In severe cases, you will need immediate hospital admission. The aggressive symptoms you should look for that point to a severe cases of typhoid fever are swollen stomach, severe diarrhea, a fever of 104 degrees or higher, or persistent vomiting. When in the hospital, you will likely be given the same or similar antibiotic treatment, but it will be administered in injectable form while you are in the hospital.


You should see a doctor immediately if you experience any of these intense symptoms.
Fluids and nutrients will also be administered to you through an intravenous drip.
Most people greatly improve 3-5 days after being admitted to the hospital. However, you may have to stay in the hospital for a few weeks to recover if your case of severe enough or if there were other complications to your health., If complications arise while you are in the hospital, you may be diagnosed with a severe case of typhoid fever. This means that you have severe complications like internal bleeding or the splitting of your digestive track. If this happens, your doctor will likely recommend that you have surgery.


This is very rare unless you are not being treated with antibiotics."

Avoid stress triggers.,
Practice meditation.,
Try tai chi.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid5," Stress can relate to increased acid reflux since it can cause people to eat more, drink alcohol, smoke, or sleep less. Food takes longer to digest in stressful conditions, delaying gastric emptying and making it likely for food to be regurgitated. Learning to avoid stressful environments and managing stressful situations with ease can help improve your overall well-being.Simple ways to reduce stress are:Slow, deep breathing in a quiet environment
Focusing on positive outcomes
Restructuring priorities and eliminating unnecessary tasks
Reducing use of electronic devices. These can also cause eye-strain and trigger headaches.
Using humor. Research has found humor to be an effective way to deal with acute stress.
Listening to relaxing music

, You can meditate by simply taking five minutes to relax and shut off your mind to outside disturbances.It may be frustrating to practice at first, but this is a great, simple way to help lower stress. To meditate, follow these steps:Find a quiet, comfortable area, such as a private spot at the office, the park, or even at home.
Get into a comfortable position and sit with your spine straight, cross-legged if possible, or on a chair, the floor or grass.
Find something to focus on. Pick a meaningful word or phrase and repeat it. You can even focus your attention on a flower or doorknob or simply close your eyes.
While sitting in comfort and relaxation, don’t be distracted by your thoughts. Instead, try to keep your focus on the word or object for 5–10 minutes or until you feel calm and serene.

, If you can’t sit still for 5 minutes or more, consider practicing tai chi. Tai chi is composed of slow, deliberate movements, meditation, and deep breathing.Practice regularly to master forms of tai chi, up to 15-20 minutes at home twice each day.Before beginning a tai chi program, you should check with your doctor and discuss your health needs with the tai chi instructor. Tell your instructor about any health conditions you may have besides acid reflux to help them create a personalized fitness program for you.

See a doctor for a diagnosis.,
Ask your doctor about medication for acid reflux.,
Ask your doctor about side effects of other medicine.,
Consider getting surgery.",How to Use Home Remedies for Decreasing Stomach Acid6," Home remedies may work some cases, but if your symptoms return consistently, then you should see your doctor. Acid reflux or heartburn may feel like a burning sensation in your chest, or taste like sour liquid in the back of your mouth and usually occurs after eating, stress, physical exercises or lying down. Sometimes acid reflux can progress to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with additional symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, difficulty swallowing, and increased chest pain especially when resting. If you experience any of these symptoms frequently, you should visit your doctor to determine if you may have GERD.

, Your doctor may suggest prescription medication to help treat moderate-to-severe symptoms of acid reflux.Whenever you are prescribed medication, it’s important to let your medical provider know about any other medications, herbs or supplements to avoid side effects. Medications that can help are:Antacids used to treat mild-to-moderate heartburn. These are the combination of magnesium, calcium, and aluminum with a buffering agent, such as a hydroxide or bicarbonate ion. Antacids can help provide immediate relief that lasts up to an hour. Side effects may include diarrhea or constipation.
H-2-receptor blockers work to reduce histamine 2, a chemical floating in the stomach that signals it to make acid. These may not provide relief as quickly as antacids, but may be effect for people with severe symptoms of GERD.
Proton pump inhibitors are more effective than H2 blockers at helping relieve symptoms of moderate-to-severe GERD and heartburn while healing the esophageal lining.
Your doctor can help determine the right medication and optimal dose for your condition.

, Certain medications you might be taking for other ailments can make your acid reflux worse, either as a side effect or causing intolerance. It is important to ask your doctor about other medications and supplements that may make your symptoms worse. Some medications for other conditions that commonly cause problems with acid reflux are:Anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and Aleve, which may also be associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcers
Calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure or angina
Anticholinergics for urinary tract infections, allergies, or glaucoma
Beta adrenergic agonist for asthma or obstructive lung disease
Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis.
Some sedatives, antibiotics, potassium, or iron supplements.

, Surgery might be an option for you if medication and lifestyle adjustments don’t help alleviate your acid reflux symptoms and interfere with your daily activities or have caused permanent damage to your esophagus. Your doctor may recommend getting fundoplication, a minimally invasive surgical treatment that involves wrapping the upper portion of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to reinforce and strengthen the LES. This procedure is safe and effective for people of all ages who experience moderate-to-severe symptoms of GERD and wish to avoid life-long dependence on medication."

Eat less food at one time.,
Reduce excess air consumption.,
Eat slower.,
Keep a food diary.",How to Relieve Bloating With Food2," Overeating is one of the most common causes of bloating. To avoid this, cut back on how much you eat in one sitting. Start by cutting back by about 10% of the food on your plate per meal and keep cutting back by about 10% every week until you get to a point where you are no longer bloated.


You should see a reduction in bloating by the second week if this is the cause of your issues. , The intake of excess air can cause bloating. To avoid this, don’t chew gum or drink carbonated drinks. Carbonated drinks have carbon dioxide, which adds air to your system. Chewing gum increases your likelihood of swallowing air.


If you like carbonated drinks, try to cut down on how many you have a day to reduce bloating.To minimize bloating, try to quit smoking. Inhaling smoke causes you to swallow more air which leads to excessive gas accumulation in the stomach., Eating too quickly can cause multiple issues that can contribute to bloating. Eating too fast can make you swallow more air and increase your risk for indigestion and gastroesophageal reflux disease.


When you eat, slow down and chew each mouthful 20 to 30 times.
Chewing your food well is part of the digestion process. Your saliva actually contains enzymes that help digest food even before you swallow., To help determine what foods are causing you issues with bloating, you should keep a food diary. Keep track of everything you eat and drink over the course of a week. Write down any time you have issues with bloating.


If you find a particular combination causes bloating, try each food or beverage separately later in the week to determine which is the issue.
For example, if you eat a bean and cheese burrito and feel bloated for three hours afterward, there are two major foods that could cause you to bloat. Later in the week, eat beans by themselves and cheese by itself to see which makes you bloated.

Take digestive enzymes.,
Relieve constipation.,
Use over the counter remedies.,
Avoid holding gas back.",How to Relieve Bloating With Food3," You may be bloating because of an enzyme deficiency. If you cannot avoid foods that cause bloating or don’t want to, you can take digestive enzymes to help your body digest foods better. This is most helpful bloating is caused by improper digestion, overeating, and lactose intolerance. Look for products with some of each of the following:


Proteases, which break down proteins
Lipases, which break down fats
Carbohydrates (such as amylase), which break down carbohydrates
Lactase, which breaks down the sugar (lactose) in dairy products
Individual digestive enzymes, such as papain and bromelain
If you are not sure which enzyme you are deficient in, buy a combination of enzymes or ask your doctor.
Look for a Seal of Approval from either the Natural Products Association (NPA) or the US Pharmacopoiea (USP)., Constipation is a common cause of bloating. If you suffer from temporary or occasional constipation, you can take fiber supplements. However, this often causes gas, so take the supplement in smaller doses throughout the day and drink plenty of water with them to reduce the chance of gas.


Probiotics are also good for constipation because they help replenish gut bacteria. Watch out for increased bloating during the first few weeks.

, There are many over the counter remedies that can help you relieve bloating. Always follow manufacturer’s instructions found on the label of these medications. These medications include:


Beano, which can help your body digest the sugars in beans and vegetables that make you feel gassy
Lactaid and Dairy Ease, which are used for bloating from any intolerance to lactose
Pepto Bismol, which can be used to ease digestion related gas and bloating
Products containing simethicone, such as Gas-X and Mylanta, can help relieve your gas, which will help the bloating subside.You can also try activated charcoal to help with gas., Trapped air or gas can cause bloating. Although it may be strange to do, do not hold back any sort of gas release, including passing gas or belching. Holding them in can cause bloating and stomach issues to get worse.


If you are in a public, excuse yourself and go to the restroom or outside. There, you can belch or pass gas without being rude.You can also help pass held in gas by maintaining good posture, which helps the gas pass as naturally as possible.

Recognize the symptoms of bloating.,
Determine the causes of bloating.,
Visit your physician.",How to Relieve Bloating With Food4," Bloating is caused by gas buildup in the stomach and intestines. This blockage leads to many different symptoms, such as excessive gas, frequent burping, and abdominal rumbling. You may notice visible swelling or puffiness in the abdomen. You may also experience abdominal pain, which can range from mild to intense or dull to sharp.


Often, passing gas or having a bowel movement will relieve some of this pain., There are many things that can cause bloating. It can be from swallowing too much air and other gases, smoking, constipation, lactose intolerance, or overeating. Many of these can typically be helped without medical intervention. If you aren’t sure about the cause of your bloating, ask your doctor.


Some conditions that commonly cause bloating include: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Celiac Disease, and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). Other rarer conditions may also cause bloating.
More serious disorders that may cause bloating are: ascites and tumors, celiac disease, dumping syndrome, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic insufficiency.Your doctor may give you medication for these conditions, which will vary depending on the conditions and its severity. Always follow your doctor’s orders about any prescription medication., Bloating should relieve itself after a day or so with the proper food or medical treatment. It may also relieve itself on its own if it is not a severe case of bloating. However, there are some situations that require medical attention. If your symptoms do not improve within two weeks of medical treatment, See your doctor immediately if you:


Experience pain so bad you cannot go through your daily activities or if it persists for days
Have excessive diarrhea
Are vomiting
Pass bloody stools, or have a significant change in the frequency or color of your stools
Experience unintended weight loss
Have chest pain"

Find a paper bag to use.,
Place the paper bag over your mouth and nose.,
Breathe in and out of the bag.",How to Stop Hyperventilating2," Breathing into a paper bag can be a useful method when managing the symptoms of a hyperventilation episode. By breathing into a paper bag you can help reuse carbon-dioxide that would normally be lost on your exhalation, maintaining proper levels in the body and avoiding the symptoms of hyperventilation.Do not use plastic bags as these can pose a choking hazard.
Make sure the paper bag is clean and there are no small items inside that could be accidentally inhaled.
Be sure that your doctor has cleared you for this technique as it can be dangerous to use when hyperventilation is caused by a physical injury or disease.

, In order to properly use the paper bag breathing method during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to make sure that it completely covers your mouth and nose. This will ensure that the carbon-dioxide is caught in the paper bag, allowing you to re-breathe it and reduce some of the effects caused by hyperventilating.Hold the bag with one hand towards the opening of the bag.
Pinching the bag slightly can help shape the opening of the bag, allowing it to fit over your mouth and nose more easily.
Place the opening of the bag directly and completely over your mouth and nose.

, Once you have placed the paper bag over your mouth and nose you can begin breathing in and out of the bag. Try to remain calm and breathe as naturally and completely as you can during an episode of hyperventilation.Take no more than six to 12 breaths using the paper bag.
Breathe as slowly and easily as you can.
After taking six to 12 breaths remove the bag from your mouth and nose and breathe without it.

Lie on your back and relax.,
Put something over your stomach.,
Breathe using your stomach.,
Keep practicing.",How to Stop Hyperventilating3," To start your practice of retraining your breathing you will need to rest comfortably on your back and relax your body. Relaxing the entire body will help you focus entirely on your breathing and let you get the most out of your breath training.Take off any tight or restrictive clothing such as a belt or tie.
You can try putting pillows under your knees or back for extra comfort.

, Breathing during an episode of hyperventilation is generally shallow, at the chest level, and rapid. You will be working to retrain your breathing to have more rhythmic and complete inhalations using your stomach and diaphragm. By placing an object on your stomach you help keep the focus on this area and provide resistance to strengthen the muscles responsible for abdominal breathing.You can place something like a telephone book on your stomach while you retrain your breathing.
Avoid any items that are too heavy or are an unusual shape. These can either cause injury or be difficult to balance on your stomach.

, After you are comfortably laying down and have a suitable object placed on your stomach you can begin to retrain your breathing. The goal here is to raise and lower the item on your stomach, using your abdomen like a balloon. Keep the following in mind as you practice this new way of breathing:Breathe through your nose when practicing. If you can't breathe through your nose you can purse your lips and breathe through your mouth.
Take comfortable and rhythmic breaths.
Breathe smoothly and try to avoid pauses on the inhalation or exhalation.
Only your abdomen should be moving. Keep the rest of your body relaxed.

, In order to get the most out of this new method of breathing you will need to get regular practice. By practicing you will become more comfortable using this method of breathing, allowing you to avoid hyperventilating during a stressful time.Practice for at least five to 10 minutes a day.
Gradually slow your rate of breathing during your practice sessions.
Begin practicing this way of breathing while sitting up or walking.
Eventually you will want to use this method right before you expect a panic attack or during one.

Consider medication.,
Work with a psychotherapist.,
Contact your doctor in an emergency.",How to Stop Hyperventilating4," If your hyperventilation is caused by panic or anxiety related issues your doctor may prescribe medications to treat your anxiety. These medications work to reduce the effects of anxiety and panic attacks, in turn reducing the instances of hyperventilation. Talk with your doctor to learn more about the medications used to treat anxiety and panic attacks.SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly prescribed antidepressants.
SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are FDA approved as a antidepressants.
Be aware that medications can take weeks before effects are noticeable.
Benzodiazepines are usually given only for short term use as they are habit forming over time.

, Hyperventilation related to panic and anxiety disorders can sometimes be treated by a psychotherapist. Your psychotherapist will work with you to uncover and cope with any underlying psychological issues that may be responsible for panic or anxiety-related issues and the hyperventilation they can cause.Most psychotherapists will use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you move beyond the physical sensations caused by panic or anxiety.
Psychotherapy sessions can take time before the effects are noticeable. Sticking with the process for several months will help ensure that your symptoms decrease or disappear completely.

, Hyperventilation can indicate a serious issue and there are some cases in which you will want to contact your doctor or seek emergency services. If you notice any of the following aspects in regards to your hyperventilation seek immediate medical attention:If this is your first time experiencing rapid breathing.
If you are in pain and hyperventilating.
If you have an injury or fever and are hyperventilating.
If your hyperventilating gets worse.
If your hyperventilating is accompanied by other symptoms.

Notice the signs of hyperventilation.,
Reassure the other person.,
Help the person to increase his carbon-dioxide levels.",How to Stop Hyperventilating5," Before you can help someone during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to assess his condition. Generally, the signs will be apparent; however, you will need to be sure that he is in fact hyperventilating in order to help him properly.Hyperventilation will usually be characterized by very fast, shallow, chest level breathing.
The person will generally appear to be in a state of panic.
Speech will be difficult for the person.
Muscle spasms in the person's hands may be visible.

, If you think someone is hyperventilating you can help by offering your reassurance that she is going to be fine. Often times hyperventilating can cause even more panic during a panic attack, resulting in an increasing cycle and worsening symptoms. Calm reassurance can help lower the amount of panic the person is feeling and restore normal breathing rates.Remind her that she is having a panic attack and that she is not experiencing something life-threatening, such as a heart attack.
Keep your tone calm, relaxed, and gentle.
Let her know that you are there with her and are not going to leave her.

, During an episode of hyperventilation, carbon-dioxide levels fall in the body and can cause symptoms typically associated with hyperventilating. In order to retain carbon-dioxide in the body, have the person breathe using the following methods:Have him purse his lips, exhaling and inhaling through them.
He may also try closing the mouth and one nostril. Have him breath in and out only through one open nostril.
If the person appears in distress, turns blue, or complains of any pain, then emergency services should be contacted for evaluation in the ER.

Incorporate yogurt into your daily diet.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Get more exercise.,
Don’t ignore your body’s rhythms.,
Avoid becoming reliant on laxatives.",How to Relieve Constipation Quickly and Naturally2," Yogurt contains live bacterial cultures (probiotics) that create the right environment for your digestive system to stay healthy and run on a regular schedule. Try adding a cup of yogurt to your daily diet.The bacteria in yogurt are thought to alter the microflora in the gut. This reduces the amount of time it takes for your food to be digested and move through your system.
Check the label to make sure the yogurt you buy has “active cultures” of live bacteria. Without live cultures the yogurt will not have the same effect.
Other fermented and cultured foods such as kombucha, kimchi and sauerkraut also contain beneficial bacteria that may aid in digestion and relieve constipation., Processed and “fast” foods can contribute to chronic constipation. These foods are often high in fat and low in fiber and do not offer much nutrition. Foods to stay away from include:Processed or “enriched” grains. White bread, pastries, many pastas, and breakfast cereals often include flour that has been stripped of much of its fiber and nutritional value. Look for whole grains instead.
Junk foods. Foods with a high level of fat and sugar can cause constipation. Your body will try to get its calories from fat first, which will slow digestion.Sausage, red meat, and luncheon meats often contain a high level of fat and salt. Look for lean meats such as fish, chicken, and turkey.
Potato chips, french fries, and similar foods do not offer much nutrition and have very little fiber. Go for roasted or baked sweet potato “fries” or air-popped popcorn instead.

, A lack of exercise may cause weakness in your intestines, making it hard to pass waste regularly. Sedentary lifestyles can affect digestion and cause constipation.Get moderate exercise at least 3-4 times a week.Walking, swimming, jogging, and yoga are all great options. Even 10-15 minutes of exercise a day can help your body stay regular.

, Your body will tell you when it is ready to have a bowel movement.There is a wide range of what is considered “normal” for bowel movement frequency. Many people average 1-2 bowel movements per day, but others may go only 3 times a week. As long as your body feels comfortable, there’s no need to worry about how often you have a bowel movement.Constipation can be caused or aggravated by not having a bowel movement when you feel the need to. If you frequently delay your bowel movements, you could cause your body to stop sending the signal to go. Delaying a bowel movement will also make it more difficult to pass later., Overusing laxatives, especially stimulant laxatives, can cause your body to become dependent on them. Do not use laxatives every day. If you have chronic constipation, consult your physician for alternative treatments.Laxatives containing polyethylene glycol are usually safer for long-term use than other types."

Try purgative herbs.,
Consult a doctor.",How to Relieve Constipation Quickly and Naturally3," If you can, try taking hourly walk-breaks to ""massage"" your bowels.Start out walking slowly for about 30 seconds. Gradually pick up the pace until you are walking as fast as you can without breaking into a run.
Do the fast walk for about 5 minutes. Then, slow down for another 5 minutes. The total time spent walking should be about 10 minutes every hour or so.If that amount of time doesn’t work for you because of other responsibilities, don’t worry. Just try to increase the amount of faster-than-normal walking you do whenever possible.
If you are severely constipated, this may be somewhat uncomfortable, but try not to get discouraged. It's better than another day of constipation.

, Aboriginal people tend to have bowel movements while squatting, and this position can be helpful.When you are on the toilet, use a stool or the edge of the bathtub to prop your feet up.You want to bring your knees in as close to your chest as possible. This increases the pressure on your bowels and may ease the passage of a stool.

, There are several yoga poses you can try to help stimulate your bowel and get your body in a comfortable position to have a bowel movement. They can increase the internal pressure on your intestines and help the bowels move the stool more easily.Among these are the following:


Baddha Konasana: In a seated position, bend your knees and bring your feet together so the soles are touching, and grasp your toes with your hands. Flutter your legs quickly, then lean forward so that your forehead touches the floor. Hold for 5 to 10 breaths.
Pavanamuktasana: In a reclined position, stretch your legs out in front of you. Bring one knee up to your chest, and hold it there with your hands. Pick one leg and pull your knee against your chest and flex or wiggle your toes. Hold that position for 5 to 10 breaths, then repeat with the other leg.
Uttanasana: From a standing position, keep your legs straight and bend at the waist. Touch the mat with your hands or grasp the back of your legs. Hold for 5 to 10 breaths.

, Liquid mineral oil will coat your stool with an oily, waterproof film. This will help the stool retain moisture and move smoothly through your colon.You can find mineral oil at most pharmacies and drug stores. Usually, it is combined with liquid, such as milk, juice, or water, to consume it.Do not take mineral oil without first consulting a doctor if you have any of the following conditions: food or medication allergies, pregnancy, heart failure, appendicitis, trouble swallowing, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting, rectal bleeding, or kidney problems.Do not take other laxatives or stool softeners at the same time as mineral oil unless instructed by your doctor.
Do not give mineral oil to children younger than 6.
Do not take mineral oil regularly. Regular use can cause dependency on its laxative effect. It can also keep your body from absorbing enough vitamins A, D, E, and K.Do not take more than the recommended dosage of mineral oil. Overdose can cause severe side effects, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. If you have taken more than the recommended dose, seek emergency medical assistance., For rare or severe constipation, there are stronger herbs that can help relieve constipation. They are usually not safe for prolonged consumption and should be considered a last resort after other treatments have not worked. Common herbal treatments include:Sennosides are stimulant laxatives. They hydrate your intestines to help your bowel movements move smoothly. Natural senna laxatives can take 6-12 hours to work. They usually come in oral suspensions and tablets.Talk with your doctor before using senna if you've recently had surgery, you already take laxatives every day, or you have any preexisting conditions involving your digestive system.European buckthorn is sometimes used to treat constipation. It is only recommended for short-term use (less than 8-10 days). It can cause side effects such as cramps, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and heart problems. It should not be used if you are pregnant, breast-feeding, or under 12 years old.Do not take European buckthorn if you have stomach pain or intestinal problems, such as appendicitis, Crohn’s disease IBS, or ulcerative colitis.

, If you have chronic constipation, you may need more effective treatment than what you can achieve with at-home remedies. For example, your doctor can prescribe medications and laxatives that are stronger than those you can purchase over-the-counter. You should see your doctor if you have not had a bowel movement in more than 3 days.If you have been mildly constipated for more than three weeks, see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you see blood in your stools, you have stomach pain, or you are losing weight.Your doctor may prescribe hypersmolar laxatives that soften stools. The most common of these laxatives are lactulose (Kristalose), sorbitol, and polyethylene glycol (MiraLax)."

Try natural remedies.There hasn't been much research done on natural remedies for acid reflux.,
Avoid debunked natural therapies.,
Increase your salivation.,
Consider getting acupuncture.",How to Reduce Excess Stomach Acid2," Though these remedies aren't fully accepted by the medical or scientific communities, they may help relieve symptoms:


Baking soda - ½ to 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water may help to neutralize stomach acid
Aloe vera - drinking aloe juice may sooth the burning sensation
Ginger or chamomile tea - these are thought to reduce stress, relieve nausea, and help with digestion
Licorice and Caraway are both herbs that many suggest may help symptoms
DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Root Extract) chewable tablets: a supplement available at most health food stores
Mastic (Arabic gum): a supplement available at most health food stores

, You may have heard that peppermint can help with acid reflux, but studies show that peppermint oil actually makes it worse.Another common belief is that milk can relieve symptoms. While it's true that milk will neutralize stomach acid for a little while, it stimulates more acid production in the long run., Studies suggest that increased salivation can neutralize stomach acid.You can increase your salivation by chewing gum or sucking on lozenges. Just make sure they're sugar-free to prevent high calorie intake.

, It might look scary, but studies have shown that acupuncture can improve symptoms of regurgitation and heartburn.The mechanism at play here isn't fully understood, scientifically, though.

Eat a balanced, healthy diet.,
Achieve and maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI).,
Count calories to lose or maintain weight.,
Avoid eating large portions.,
Avoid foods that make GERD symptoms worse.,
Maintain a regular exercise schedule.,
Avoid straining or exercising vigorously, especially shortly after eating.,
Avoid bad habits that make symptoms worse.",How to Reduce Excess Stomach Acid3," In general, a balanced diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat/fat free dairy. It also includes lean (low-fat) proteins, such as poultry, fish, and beans. Your diet should also be low in saturate and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugars. The USDA has many resources available to learn more about how to create a balanced diet., In medical terms, a healthy weight is defined by something called a body mass index (BMI). The BMI estimates your appropriate weight range according to height and sex. A normal BMI is 18.5-24.9. BMIs below 18.5 are underweight, from 25.0-29.9 are overweight, and above 30.0 are obese.


Use a BMI calculator to find out your BMI.Adjust your diet and exercise to bring your BMI into the ""normal"" range.

, Checking nutrition labels for calories is a simple and efficient way to manage your weight. Make sure you stay within the recommended calorie range for your dietary needs every single day. You can estimate your daily calories needs by multiplying your weight in pounds by 10. So, if you weight 180 lbs, you should eat 1800 calories daily to maintain your weight.


Note that this number can vary depending on your gender, age, and daily activity level. For a more accurate number, use a calorie calculator.
The healthiest rate to lose weight is at about one pound per week. A pound of fat is about 3500 calories, so decrease your daily intake by 500 calories. (500 calories x 7 days/week = 3500 calories/7 days = 1 lb/week).
Use a calorie tracking website or phone app to help keep track of what you're eating., Eat meals slowly, and take small, thoroughly chewed bites for efficient digestion. Large, poorly chewed bites will add to how much time it takes for your stomach to break down food. You'll over-eat as a result. Eating quickly can also make you swallow too much air, which can lead to bloating.


It can take up to 20 minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that you are full. Because of this, people who eat quickly tend to over-eat.

, Unfortunately, there are no specific foods that have been scientifically proven to cure GERD. You can, however, avoid foods that have been shown to make it worse:


Caffeinated drinks (coffee, tea, soda)
Caffeine-like chemicals (chocolate, peppermint)
Alcohol
Spicy foods (hot peppers, curry, hot mustards)
Acidic foods (citrus fruits, tomatoes, sauces and dressings that have vinegar)
Large amounts of foods that cause bloating and gas (cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, legumes, dairy, and high-fat foods)
Sugar or sugary foods

, The American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate activity at least 5 days per week. Or, you can combine 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity 3 days a week with moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening twice a week.If that sounds like more than you can manage, something is always better than nothing! Do your best to get as much exercise as you can. Even going for a short walk is better than sitting on the couch!The more calories you burn through exercise, the more calories you can eat! Many calorie-tracking programs help you keep track of how exercise affects how much you can eat on a day-to-day basis.

, Depending on the size and type of meal, your stomach takes 3-5 hours to digest and empty its contents.To avoid reflux, let most of that time pass or eat smaller meals before participating in such activities.

, If you smoke or use any other tobacco products, you should quit as soon as possible. Alcohol can also make acid reflux worse, so either cut it out of your diet or cut back significantly. Finally, avoid lying down soon after eating. If you can't do that, try sleeping with your head elevated by several pillows.

Being aware of your risk for this disease can help you recognize it and get a diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner.Most people are diagnosed with IBD before the age of 30, but others may not develop the disease until they are in their 50s or 60s.Caucasians, especially Ashkenazi Jews, are at the highest risk of IBD, but it can occur in any race.If a close relative, such as a parent or sibling, has IBD you are at higher risk for developing the disease.Cigarette smoking significantly increases your risk of developing Crohn’s Disease.Using certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and diclofenac sodium, can increase your risk of developing IBD or worsen the disease if you already have it.Environmental factors, such as living in an urban area or northern climates and eating a diet high in fat and refined foods, may increase your risk of developing IBD.;
, Although Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis may have similar symptoms, they still differ slightly. Recognizing the symptoms of Crohn’s Disease can help you get a diagnosis from your doctor and take steps to manage the disease in your everyday life. Not all patients have severe symptoms, so it is important to be aware of the various ways that Crohn's disease can present.


You may experience persistent diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, fever, and occasional blood in your stool.Loss of appetite and weight loss may also occur with Crohn’s Disease. It can also affect your joints, eyes, skin, and liver.The most common complication of Crohn’s Disease is intestinal blockage as a result of swelling and scar tissue. Symptoms of blockage, such as cramping pain, vomiting, and bloating, may be present. You may also develop fistulas as a result of sores or ulcers in the intestinal tract.People with Crohn’s Disease are at a higher risk of colon cancer and need to be screened more often than the general population., Although ulcerative colitis may have similar symptoms to Crohn’s Disease, it is nevertheless slightly different. Recognizing the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can help you get a diagnosis from your doctor and take steps to manage the disease in your everyday life.


Typical symptoms of ulcerative colitis are frequent bloody stools, cramping abdominal pain, and severe urgency to have a bowel movement or diarrhea.Loss of appetite and weight loss are common symptoms of ulcerative colitis. You may also experience fatigue and abdominal bloating.Most people with ulcerative colitis will have mild symptoms, though others can have severe cramping, fever, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting.Severe bleeding can lead to anemia in ulcerative colitis patients. They may also have skin lesions, join pain, liver disorders, and eye inflammation.People with ulcerative colitis are at a higher risk of colon cancer and, like people with Crohn's disease, need to be screened regularly., It’s important to pay attention to your body and bodily functions for any symptoms of IBD. These signs, such as diarrhea or fever, can indicate the disease, especially if they don’t go away.


Watch your bowel movements for frequent diarrhea or the need to quickly evacuate your bowels.Check the toilet tissue or toilet bowl for signs of blood before you flush.
Watch your underwear or towels for signs of rectal bleeding or bowel leakage.
Many people with IBD have a persistent low-grade fever and may also experience night sweats.Some women may experience a loss of their normal menstrual cycle., Consider if you have experienced a recent, prolonged loss of appetite or unintended weight loss, especially in conjunction with other symptoms of IBD. These may be clear signs that you’re suffering from IBD and should see a doctor.The loss of appetite may be a result of abdominal pain and cramping and inflammation. This can lead to unintended weight loss., Inflammatory Bowel Disease can present itself with severe or chronic pain in the abdomen and may even cause joint pain. If you have prolonged stomachaches or pain in the joints that is not related to other conditions or physical activity, you may have this symptom as a result of IBD.


You may have general abdominal pain or cramping with IBD.There may also be abdominal bloating accompanied by pain or cramping.Aches and pains from IBD may present themselves in other parts of your body as well. Watch for pain in your joints or eye inflammation., Examine your skin to notice changes in your overall complexion or skin texture, such as red bumps, ulcers, or rashes. These could indicate IBD, especially if experienced in conjunction with other symptoms.


Some skin lesions can turn into fistulas, which are infected tunnels that develop in the skin., If you discover any of the signs or symptoms of IBD and/or are at risk for the disease, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis is important to help treat and manage the disease.


Your doctor may diagnose IBD only after she rules out other possible causes for your symptoms.Your doctor may use a variety of tests to help diagnose IBD., If your doctor suspects that you have IBD, she may order tests after conducting your physical exam and ruling out other causes. These tests are the only way to confirm a diagnosis of IBD.


Your doctor may order a blood test to check for anemia, which is a common side effect of IBD. The blood tests may also determine if you have any signs of infection, bacteria, or viruses in your system.Your doctor may order a stool sample called a fecal occult blood test that checks for hidden blood in your stool.Your doctor may order an endoscopic procedure, such as a colonoscopy or upper endoscopy, to examine your intestines. In these procedures, a small camera is inserted into some portion of your gastrointestinal tract. If the doctor sees areas that are inflamed or abnormal, she will take biopsies. These are especially important in making the diagnosis.Your doctor may also order an imaging procedure, such as an X-ray, CT scan, or and MRI. These will help your doctor examine the tissues of your gastrointestinal tract and see if there are any complications of IBD, such as a perforated colon., If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of IBD with tests, she will prescribe a course of treatment based the severity of the disease. There are many different treatment and management options for IBD.


Treatment for IBD revolves around reducing the inflammation that triggers the symptoms of the disease. There is no cure for IBD.Treatment for IBD generally involves drug therapy or surgery; most people with Crohn’s Disease will have to have some surgery during their lifetime.Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs such as aminosalicylates or corticosteroids, to help relieve IBD short term. These drugs can cause side effects such as night sweats, insomnia, hyperactivity, and development of excessive facial hair.Some doctors may prescribe immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, infliximab, or methotrexate.Your doctor may also prescribe an antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin to help control or prevent infection., In cases where medication and lifestyle changes don’t help IBD, your doctor may elect to do surgery to help manage the disease. Surgery is a last resort treatment and can have some unpleasant side effects that are not particularly long lasting.Surgery for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease involves removing parts of the gastrointestinal tract.You may have to wear a colostomy bag to collect bowel movements following surgery. It may be a difficult adjustment to living with a colostomy bag, but you can still lead a full and active life.Almost one half of people suffering from Crohn’s will require surgery, but it will not cure the disease.A total colostomy can cure the GI aspects of ulcerative colitis, though it will not cure the systemic symptoms of the disease (uveitis, arthritis, etc.)

, There is some evidence that changing your diet and taking nutritional supplements can help manage the symptoms of IBD. Your doctor may suggest changing your eating and nutritional habits along with other medical therapies.Your doctor may suggest a feeding tube or nutrient injections to help your bowel rest and reduce inflammation.Your doctor may also suggest a low-residue diet of foods that will not cause a blockage in your bowel.Low-residue foods, which are low in fiber include yogurt, creamy soups, refined white breads and pastas, and crackers. You’ll want to avoid raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, and whole grain products.Your doctor may also suggest taking iron, calcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B-12 supplements to help replace nutrients lost as a result of the symptoms of IBD.Eating small meals that are low in fat and not high in fiber may help with the symptoms of IBD.Drinking plenty of liquids can help alleviate the symptoms of IBD. Water is the most optimal choice to help keep you hydrated., While most haven't shown much benefit, they have had positive results for some. Talk with a doctor before trying any herbal or alternative therapies.


Recent studies have shown that alternative therapies such as consuming more soluble fiber or probiotics, drinking peppermint oil teas, or trying hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective at helping some patients minimize the symptoms of IBD., Making changes to your lifestyle habits can help manage your IBD. From quitting smoking to avoiding stress, these changes may help alleviate your symptoms.Smoking may make Crohn’s Disease worse, and those who smoke are more likely to have relapses and need repeat surgeries.Reducing stress may also help alleviate the symptoms of IBD. You can reduce stress through regular relaxation and breathing exercises or meditation.Regular and even gentle exercise will not only help reduce stress, but may also help normalize bowel function. Speak to your doctor about the best type of exercise to manage your IBD., Since IBD is an umbrella term for Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis, it’s important to know the difference between these similar diseases. This may help you more effectively recognize any symptoms of the disease and get timely treatment.Crohn’s Disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s Disease mostly affects the end of the small bowel, or ileum, and the beginning of the colon, though it may appear anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus.Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's are both abnormal immune responses, but each of them affects a different site. Ulcerative colitis causes chronic inflammation in the colon and the development of open sores or ulcers in the colon.While Crohn’s Disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, ulcerative colitis only affects the colon., IBD can be an extremely devastating disease for you and your loved ones. Joining a support group of IBD patients or speaking to other doctors or a therapist can help you understand and manage the disease.The Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America offers many tools on its website, including stories of others afflicted with IBD. You can also find a support group using their site at http://www.ccfa.org.

Natural remedies are meant to help you feel better while the antibiotics are fighting the disease, not to take place of the antibiotics.


Ask you doctor about any natural treatments that you start. You want to make sure they don't interact with the particular antibiotic you are taking.Always check with your doctor before using these treatments for children or pregnant women.

, It’s important to drink a lot of fluids when suffering from typhoid fever. Drink at least 64 ounces of water each day and supplement it with juice, coconut water, and other hydrating drinks. Dehydration generally gets brought on by diarrhea and high fever, which are two of the most common symptoms of typhoid fever.


In severe cases, intravenous administration of fluids is recommended., Typhoid fever may cause you to experience nutritional deficiencies. Pay attention to what you eat and be sure you provide nutritious, high calorie meals for your body. Having a higher intake of carbohydrates will help you replenish your energy, especially if you have smaller meals multiple times a day. If you are having gastrointestinal problems, it is important to eat only soft foods that are easy to consume, such as soup, crackers, toast, puddings, and jello.Eat foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.

Take one tablet twice a day with a glass of water.
This remedy is a great antioxidant and anti-microbial, which helps you to deal with digestive issues caused by typhoid fever., Echinacea, which comes in the form of a purple flower, roots, or a powder, is great for enhancing your immune system and fighting bacterial infections. It is also great for strengthening body tissues. Purchase some dried flower powder or a couple of Echinacea roots. Boil a teaspoon of the Echinacea ingredients in 8 ounces of water for 8-10 minutes.


Drink this tea two or three times per day, but only for up to 2 weeks., One of the main symptoms of typhoid fever is diarrhea. To help fight this symptom, boil 6-8 pieces of carrots in 8 ounces of water for 8-10 minutes. Filter the liquid of the bits of carrots. Add 2-3 pinches of ground black pepper to the water. Drink the soup mixture whenever your diarrhea gets to be too much.


You can add more or less pepper, depending on taste., Dehydration is a major side effect of the symptoms of typhoid fever. To help combat this, you can make a juice mixture that will hydrate you quickly and provide natural electrolytes and minerals. Mix 1 tablespoon of ginger juice into 8 ounces of apple juice. Drink it a few times a day to stay hydrated.

Get vaccinated.,
Consume only safe water.,
Treat water from questionable sources.,
Practice food safety.,
Practice good environmental sanitation.,
Keep proper personal hygiene.",How to Recover From Typhoid Fever3," There are two types of typhoid vaccines that are used. You can use the injectible Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine and the oral Ty21a typhoid vaccine. The injected vaccine is given as a single dose at 0.5 milliliters injected into the muscle of the upper arm and on the upper surface of the thigh. The oral vaccine is given through 4 doses spaced 2 days apart, so it would be given on Days 0, 2, 4, and 6.


The injected vaccine is given to children above two years old and adults. Re-vaccination is done every five years.The oral vaccine is given 24 to 72 hours after intake of any antibiotics by mouth on an empty stomach so that the vaccine will not be destroyed by the antibiotics. It is given to children above six years old and adults.You should get get your vaccines completed at least one to two weeks before you travel, depending on which vaccine you get. The vaccine works on individuals that have had typhoid fever as well as those that have not. However, you should get re-vaccinated every 2-5 years. Ask your doctor about how long the particular vaccine you are given will work., Unsafe water is a main conduit for typhoid fever. There are only certain kinds of water you should drink when you visit or live in non-industrialized countries. You should only drink bottled water that is from a reputable source. You should also never ask for ice unless you are sure that it has been made from bottled or safe water.


You should also avoid popsicles or iced desserts unless you know they are made from safe water.
Bottled carbonated water is safer than regular bottled water., If you cannot get bottled water, you can still drink the water you have. You just have to treat it first. Boil the water for at least one minute, especially if you are not sure if the water source, such as a water tap or water pump, is safe. Avoid drinking water from springs, rivers, and other water bodies.


If you cannot boil it, put chlorine tablets in water obtained from doubtful sources.If you live in an area with unsafe water, have a piped water system built in your home and community. Have separate, clean, and covered containers to store water.

, You can also get typhoid fever from food sources. When visiting certain countries, always cook vegetables, fish, or meat well. Wash these items well in clean water before cooking. If you eat raw food, wash them well in clean water or dip them in hot water. Peel all raw vegetables after you wash them with soap and hot water. Never eat the peelings because contaminants can live on them. If possible, avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables that can't be peeled.


Have separate clean containers to store food and keep food containers away from areas of contamination, such as the toilet, garbage, or sewage pipes. Do not store cooked food for prolonged periods in the refrigerator. Eat them as soon as possible. Otherwise, dispose of them after 2 or more days of cold storage.
Avoid eating food sold by street vendors when you travel to countries where typhoid fever is common., If you are in a location that has typhoid fever, clean your surroundings well. Remove spoiling edible items and place them in properly kept garbage containers. Repair damaged water pipes and sewage canals or pipes in order to avoid spillage of contaminated water in the environment.


Separate areas of food and water storage from areas where sewage pipes, toilets, or septic tanks are in order to avoid food and water contamination by contaminated water from these facilities., You can pass typhoid fever through touch, so you should practice safe personal hygiene as well. Wash your hands, preferably with soap or alcohol gel, before and after handling or cooking food, dealing with water, after using the toilet, or handling any dirty object. Be clean and neat in your general appearance and bathing daily is necessary.


Always wipe your hands on clean towels and not on the clothes you are presently wearing."

Get plenty of rest.",How to Get Rid of a Deep Cough1," Keep the air humid by using a vaporizer or by taking hot, steamy shower, especially if the cough is dry. Sit close to the vaporizer or humidifier and breathe in deeply.Humidifiers are especially useful at night, so you can also place the humidifier near your bed. This can help thin secretions, which will make it easier to cough them out.


Take care to breathe in slowly since deep breaths can cause you to start coughing.
You can also try a cool mist humidifier for warmer months. These are also safer for use with children.;
, To keep your mucus thin and moving, you need to stay hydrated. Drink at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day as a minimum.You should actually try to drink more when you have a cough. Warm fluids can help soothe your throat while keeping you hydrated.


Try drinking warm chicken or vegetable broths. If you get tired of drinking water, you can also drink juices or herbal teas.

, Depending on what's causing your cough (like acid reflux disease), you may want to eat small amounts of food more frequently throughout the day.The foods should be easy to digest, yet filling. The goal is to provide a constant supply of energy to your body so your immune system can do its job and heal your cough.


Be sure to include quality protein like fish and skinless poultry as well as complex carbohydrates like whole grains and vegetables.

, Help your body recover from the exhaustion of deep coughing by resting as much as possible. Try to take time off from work or school. You'll give yourself a chance to recover faster and you won't be putting your co-workers or classmates at risk of catching something.


If your child has a deep cough, keep her home from school. She's more likely to get her classmates or teacher sick.

Watch for shortness of breath, particularly with exertion.Shortness of breath that gets worse with exertion is a cardinal sign of COPD.,
Evaluate your cough.Another one of the classic signs of COPD is a chronic, productive cough (often bringing up mucus/sputum).,
Look out for other respiratory symptoms.There are a variety of other respiratory symptoms that may go hand-in-hand with COPD.,
Take risk factors into account.The number one risk factor for COPD is smoking.,
Opt for lung function tests.Lung function tests evaluate things such as how much air your lungs can hold, and how strong your breathing is.,
Ask your doctor for an x-ray.A chest x-ray can be useful in ruling in or ruling out conditions that may present similarly to COPD.,
Receive a CT scan.A CT scan can provide an even more detailed look at the lungs than an x-ray can.,
Get a blood gas analysis.This test determines the effectiveness of your lungs at delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide.,
Quit smoking.Smoking is the number one risk factor for developing COPD, and also for the condition to continue to worsen with time.,
Treat your symptoms with medication.There are a number of medications that can help reduce symptoms of COPD and improve your breathing.,
See a doctor for COPD ""exacerbations.,
Ask about oxygen supplementation.If your COPD symptoms make it challenging to breathe on a day-to-day basis, and interfere with your daily function, you may wish to ask your doctor about supplemental oxygen.,
Consider surgery and/or a lung transplant as a last resort.When COPD symptoms are very severe, there are two surgical options that may be considered for treatment.",How to Distinguish COPD from Similar Conditions," However, in itself it is not diagnostic, as there are other medical conditions that may present similarly.


Congestive heart failure (CHF) also has shortness of breath (that is worsened with exertion) as one of its cardinal signs. The difference with CHF as opposed to COPD, however, is that CHF is also worse when lying down, and may be worse in the middle of the night. CHF also shows different results in lung function tests, on a chest x-ray, and with other diagnostic tests, as described in Part 2 of this article.
Shortness of breath may also be confused with asthma, and both COPD and asthma can have a ""wheezing"" component. However, asthma responds better to medication, shows different results on diagnostic testing, and is more often associated with ""episodes"" tied to a direct trigger (such as an allergen, cold weather, exertion, etc.);
, However, once again, a cough is a very generalized symptom, and can be present in a number of different conditions.


A cough may be present in a respiratory tract infection. This can be distinguished from COPD by the presence of a fever and other infectious signs, as well as testing the sputum for the presence of bacteria or other microbes.
A cough may be present in lung cancer. This can be distinguished from COPD by the detection of a mass (lump) on imaging techniques (such as an x-ray or CT scan), as well as other signs of cancer such as night sweats and/or significant unintentional weight loss. The hallmark of lung cancer is hemoptysis, which is coughing up blood.

, These include wheezing (which may be present in both COPD and asthma), a tight feeling in the chest, and/or frequent lung infections (you are more prone to recurrent respiratory infections if you have COPD). You may also experience unusual fatigue, and/or unintentional weight loss (this may be a late sign of severe COPD. It is also a common sign in lung cancer and other cancers).

, If you have a history of smoking, and/or if you are currently a smoker, your likelihood of having COPD increases dramatically. It increases in proportion to the amount of cigarettes (or pipes or marijuana) that you have consumed in your lifetime. Other risk factors for COPD include:


Workplace exposure to chemicals, fumes, dusts, and/or toxic vapors
A history of other lung conditions, such as asthma or other chronic respiratory conditions
Age above 35-40 years old
A genetic disorder called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
An increased airway responsiveness to allergen or allergic stimuli and atopy
Gender: women appear to be more susceptible to developing COPD and emphysema than men are
Antioxidant deficiency: deficiency in antioxidants, vitamin C, and vitamin E may be a risk factor for COPD, They are capable of diagnosing COPD even before you begin to show significant symptoms!


However, lung function tests tend to be used only in people who show suspicious signs of respiratory disease (such as the possibility of having COPD, among other things).
Lung function tests may also be used for ongoing monitoring of a lung condition such as COPD, and to measure the effectiveness of various treatment options.
The lung function test will give you a ratio of the FEV1/FVC, and this number is one of the main diagnostic criteria for COPD and asthma. In COPD, the number is decreased., For instance, a chest x-ray can help to rule out congestive heart failure, which normally shows signs of an enlarged heart on x-ray. A chest x-ray can also be used to look for other causes of a cough or shortness of breath, such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or interstitial lung disease.


Finally, a chest x-ray can show signs of emphysema, which is one of the contributing factors to COPD. If emphysema is detected on x-ray, you most likely have COPD.
Signs of COPD on CXR include a flat diaphragm, increased radiolucency, and a long and narrow heart shadow., It can elucidate conditions like interstitial lung disease, a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), lung cancer, pneumonia, and COPD.

, This test helps to inform your doctor about the severity of your COPD, if you do in fact have it, and what degree of treatment will be needed (such as whether or not you will require oxygen supplementation).

, Therefore, one of the most effective things you can do in the treatment of COPD is to quit smoking, if you currently smoke. This will decrease the severity of your symptoms and prevent the condition from progressing with further lung damage.


If you are interested in quitting smoking, you can speak to your physician for help and support.
There are medications as well as nicotine replacement strategies that can make it easier - and increase your likelihood of success - when it comes to quitting smoking.
Follow the START acronym: S= Set a quit date; T= Tell you friends and family you are quitting; A= Anticipate difficulty and plan ahead; R= Remove tobacco products from your home, car, and at work; and T= Talk to you Doctor and inform him of your plans., Some options include:


""Bronchodilators"" - these help to widen your airway passages and can improve your breathing. An example of an inhaled bronchodilator is Salbutamol (Ventolin), or Atrovent.
Steroids - you can use inhaled steroids to decrease the inflammation in your airways, and thus to improve respiration. An example of an inhaled steroid is Fluticasone (Flovent).
Make sure you take your medication as prescribed by your doctor.

,""The symptoms of COPD tend to continue at a fairly steady rate on a day-to-day basis. However, there are periods of a few days where you may experience what is called a ""COPD exacerbation."" This is when your symptoms temporarily get noticeably worse. Signs of a COPD exacerbation may include a worse cough, more mucus production, increased shortness of breath, and/or a fever. Treatments for COPD exacerbations include the following:


Administration of antibiotics if an infection is the underlying cause of your COPD exacerbation.
An increased dosage of inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid medications to get better control of symptoms.
Systemic (pill form) steroid medications to decrease inflammation if needed.
Supplemental oxygen, and machines to aid with respiration if needed.
Administration of necessary vaccines (such as the influenza vaccine, among others), if you have not already been vaccinated, to prevent further infections that could be avoided by being vaccinated.

, Some people with more severe COPD are greatly benefited by supplemental oxygen, and it can greatly ease respiratory distress.


Supplemental oxygen usually involves having an oxygen tank that you can wheel with you.
You usually have nasal prongs which deliver the oxygen from the tank to your lungs.
Indications for supplemental oxygen include a pulse oximetry less that 88% on ambulation., These are:


Surgery to remove a diseased portion(s) of your lung. If certain areas of your lung(s) have been rendered essentially non-functional from your COPD, these areas can be surgically removed. This, in turn, opens up space in your chest for the functional areas of your lungs to work better - they then have more space to expand with air, and your ease of breathing should improve considerably.
A lung transplant. This tends to be used as a last-resort option, because any organ transplant is a major procedure with significant risks, and you are required to be on life-long immunosuppressive drugs in hopes that your body will not reject the transplant. It is used in very few COPD patients. However, for those whose condition is very severe, it may be the best option for treatment.

Breathe through your nose.,
Take deeper ""belly breaths."",
Loosen your clothing.,
Try relaxation techniques.,
Get some aerobic exercise.,
Cut back on caffeine.,
Consult with your doctor.,
See a mental health professional.,
Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Prevent Hyperventilation," Breathing through your nose is an effective technique to combat hyperventilation because you simply can't move as much air through your nose compared to your mouth.As such, nose breathing reduces your respiratory rate. It may take some getting used to and you may need to cleanse your nasal passages first, but breathing through your nose is more efficient and better filters dust and other particulate material from air compared to mouth breathing.


Breathing through your nose will also help eliminate some common abdominal symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome, such as bloating, burping and passing gas.
Nose breathing will also help combat dry mouth and bad breath, which are also associated with mouth breathing and chronic hyperventilation.;
, People who chronically hyperventilate usually take shallow breaths from their mouths and only fill up their upper chest (upper lung fields) when they inhale. This is inefficient and doesn't get enough oxygen into the blood, which increases respiratory rates. Persistent shallow breathing also causes too much carbon dioxide to be exhaled, which creates a negative feedback loop and further triggers hyperventilation. Instead, inhale through your nose and practice involving your diaphragm more, which will act to suck more air into your lower lung fields and supply your blood with more oxygen.This technique is often called ""belly breathing"" (or diaphragmatic breathing) because your lower abdomen will protrude outwards when you force your diaphragm muscle down.


Practice taking deep breaths in through your nose and watch your belly push out before your chest expands. You'll notice a relaxing sensation and reduced respiratory rate after a few minutes.
Try holding your breath in your lungs a little longer also — aim for about three seconds or so to start with.

, On the practical side of things, it's difficult to take deep breaths if your clothing is too tight, so loosen your belt and make sure your pants fit comfortably — particularly to make belly breathing easier.Furthermore, keep clothing loose around your chest and neck, including shirts and bras. If you have a history of hyperventilation, then avoid neck ties, scarves and turtlenecks, as they may make you feel constrained and trigger an attack.


Tight clothes may contribute to the feeling of suffocation in sensitive (or phobic) individuals, so wearing loose clothing is an important strategy for some.
Clothing made of soft fibers (cotton, silk) may also be helpful, as rougher fabrics such as wool can cause skin irritation, discomfort, overheating and agitation in some people.

, Since stress and anxiety seem to be the major underlying causes of chronic hyperventilation syndrome, and are well documented to trigger acute episodes, a sensible strategy is to better manage how you react to stress. Stress-relieving practices like meditation, tai chi and yoga are all helpful for promoting relaxation and better emotional health.Yoga, in particular, is not just about putting your body into various poses, but it also incorporates breathing exercises, which is particularly important for combating hyperventilation. In addition, try to deal with the stress in your life by making positive changes and/or train yourself to control anxious thoughts about work, finances, or relationships.


Excessive stress/anxiety cause the release of hormones that prepare your body for ""fight or flight"", which includes altered breathing and heart rates.
Getting enough quality sleep is also important for better dealing with stress. A chronic lack of sleep hampers the immune system and often leads to anxiety and depressed feelings., Regular (daily) aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is another method to help you stop hyperventilating because it forces you to take deeper breaths and it can improve breathing efficiency.Regular aerobic exercise also promotes weight loss, improves cardiovascular health, increases fitness and tends to reduce anxiety that contributes to hyperventilation. Aerobic exercise is any sustained movement that increases your heart and breathing rates to the point that carrying on a normal conversation becomes difficult.


Other healthy examples of aerobic exercise include swimming, cycling, and jogging.
An increased breathing rate from aerobic exercise (characterized by deep breathing to increase blood oxygen levels) should not be confused with hyperventilation, which is characterized by shallow breathing triggered by anxiety and then perpetuated to increase blood carbon dioxide levels.

, Caffeine is a nervous system stimulant found in coffee, tea leaves, soda pop, chocolate, energy drinks, some prescription drugs and over-the-counter weight loss products. Caffeine increases brain activity (which disrupts sleep), can trigger anxiety, and also negatively impacts breathing — it's been linked to hyperventilation and sleep apnea (breathing disruption during sleep)As such, cut down or eliminate your caffeine consumption if you commonly experience bouts of hyperventilation.


To reduce the risk or degree of sleep disruption, avoid all products with caffeine after lunchtime. Sleep deprivation leads to anxiety, which can trigger hyperventilation. Some people are slow metabolizers of caffeine, and some are fast metabolizers. Slow metabolizers may not be able to drink it at all, and fast metabolizers might be able to drink it within hours of bedtime
Chronic, daily consumption of caffeinated beverages doesn't seem to have as much impact on breathing (because the body adapts to it) compared to occasional use or binge drinking.
Fresh brewed coffee tends to be the most concentrated source of caffeine. It can also be found in colas, energy drinks, teas, and chocolate.

, Although stress and anxiety are thought to be the main underlying causes of hyperventilation, some medical conditions are also causative. As such, see your family physician and get a checkup and physical examination to rule out more serious causes of hyperventilation such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, lung infection, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, chronic pain syndrome and overmedication.Diagnostic tests that your doctor may perform include: taking a blood sample (checking for oxygen and carbon dioxide levels), ventilation / perfusion scan of your lungs, chest x-ray, CT chest scan, ECG / EKG (to check heart function).
Prescription drugs that are strongly linked to hyperventilation include isoproterenol (heart medication), seroquel (an antipsychotic), and some anti-anxiety medications, such as alprazolam and lorazepam.
Women are much more likely to experience hyperventilation than men — they have up to a seven times greater risk., If your doctor rules out serious disease as the cause of hyperventilation and anxiety or panic attacks are suspected, get a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist to help treat your problem.Psychological counseling / therapy (which includes many different approaches and techniques) can be effective at helping you deal with stress, anxiety, phobias, depression, and even chronic pain. For example, supportive psychotherapy can reassure you that you're getting enough oxygen during an attack. It can also help dissolve an irrational phobia (fear) that triggers a panic attack.


Ask your therapist about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) — it helps you control or eliminate negative thoughts, worries and any false beliefs that are stressing you out and disrupting sleep.About 50% of people with a panic disorder have hyperventilation symptoms, whereas about 25% of people with hyperventilation syndrome have a panic disorder., If an underlying psychological disorder can't be properly treated with drugless therapy / counseling and the bouts of hyperventilation are creating increasingly noticeable physical and/or social problems, then medication should be considered as a last resort. Anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives, beta-blockers and tricyclic antidepressants can be useful and helpful for some individuals, but they should be taken cautiously — usually just short term — and with the understanding of the numerous side effects that are possible (particularly psychotic behavior).Short-term use of medications that impact thoughts, emotions and behaviors usually fall within the time frame of a few weeks to less than six months.
Most people can be taught to manage hyperventilation syndrome without medication (especially with help of a psychotherapist), while others benefit from short-term use of psychotropic drugs. However, some with chemical imbalances in their brains may need pharmaceutical care long-term (for many years).

Recognize signs of an infestation.,
Clean your kitchen.,
Cover trash cans or pet food containers.,
Set rodent traps.,
Seal entry holes.,
Call a professional pest management company.",How to Prevent Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)1," Look for small pellets of rodent droppings about ¼ – ½"" (0.5 – 1.0cm) in size. You may also see signs of gnawing on your furniture or rodent tracks in dusty spaces. If you find small wads of soft materials or paper, you may have found rodent nests. You might even smell rodent urine or be able to hear them scurrying around.If you have mice, you may find uneaten food since they won't eat everything they find. If you have rats, you might only find inedible things like shells or bones.;
, Remove rodent food sources inside your house. Wash your dishes and sweep and mop your kitchen floors. When sweeping be careful not to stir up any dust that you might breathe in. Inhalation of any rat droppings/dust is a sure way to contract the virus. Try to do this before you go to bed every night since rodents are most active at night.Store the food in your pantry in rodent-proof jars. The jars should be thick metal, glass or plastic and should have tight-fitting lids so that rodents can't chew through them.

, Use garbage cans that have tight-fitting lids and try to take the trash out before night. Clean out the garbage cans with soapy water in between uses so that food doesn't build up inside the can. You should also remove or cover any uneaten pet food at the end of the day.Only put out enough pet food for one day. Allowing your pet to have unlimited access to food also gives rodents unlimited access to a food supply.

, Purchase rat or mice traps depending on the type of rodents you have around your house or workplace. Spread a pea-sized amount of peanut butter on the snap trap and place the trap on the floor near the baseboard. To dispose of rodents and traps, spray them with disinfectant and scoop them into a double bag. Seal the bags and bury or burn them.Avoid using glue or live traps since these can cause the live mice to urinate and spread disease.
If plague is suspected in your area, spray the trap, your clothes, your shoes, and your hands with an insect repellent that contains DEET. This will kill the fleas on the rodents that may transmit the disease., If you find holes in your walls, you should fill them. Take a ball of steel wool and place it in the hole so that it's completely filled in. This will prevent rodents from getting into your house. Remember to check and seal all interior and exterior walls for holes.You can use other patching supplies, depending on the size of the hole. You could use insulation foam, wood filler, or putty to fill the hole. If the hole is large, you may need to replace the piece of the wall.

, If you still see signs of rodents after completely cleaning and sealing up your house, you may need to get professional help. Professional pest companies will be able to quickly and effectively remove the rodents from your home before they begin to transmit disease.If you have a large or widespread infestation, you may want to contact a pest management company even before you begin cleaning and sealing your home.

Listen for whooping cough.,
Pay attention to your symptoms.,
Consider the cause of your cough.,
Monitor your relief.",How to Get Rid of a Deep Cough2," Whooping cough is characterized by fits of uncontrolled violent coughs which make it very hard to breathe. When you finally do feel like you can breathe, the breath often sounds like a ""whoop."" Whooping cough is caused by a bacterium and is more common now because of decreased immunization rates, effectiveness of newer vaccines, and new bacterial strains of the disease.


It's important to treat whooping cough early because it's highly contagious.
If you're unsure what whooping cough sounds like, you can easily search for a recording of the ""whoop.""However, sometimes whopping cough is just a cough that lasts for a few weeks.
Talk to your doctor right away if you think that you or your child might have whooping cough.

, If you or your child have any of the following symptoms, call your doctor for an appointment or advice:


Coughing up thick and/or greenish-yellow phlegm (which is a sign of infection)
Wheezing or a whistling sound at the beginning or end of the breath (sign of inefficient lung function)
Any odd sounding cough and difficulty breathing at the end of a cough
Fever of more than 100.4 for more than two to three days
Any shortness of breath or chest pain
Coughing up bloodHaving a wet cough for more than one to two weeks or a dry cough for more than three weeks

, Coughs are caused by a variety of conditions. You might have an upper-respiratory infection which can irritate your nose or sinuses, causing cough. This also makes it likely that increased mucus can drip down the back of your throat and irritate it, causing coughing. This is called post-nasal drip. If the infection gets into your lungs, it can cause pneumonia, which can be more serious. You might cough if you breathe in an allergy or asthma trigger like allergens or dust. Or, you might cough if you inhale a foreign object.Keep in mind that some medications, especially some blood pressure drugs, can cause cough.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may cause you to cough when stomach acid flows back into and irritates your esophagus.
Chronic bronchitis is another main cause of coughing that is commonly caused by smoking. The network of tubes (bronchioles) are inflamed and irritated.
If you have a dry, deep and persistent cough, it may be caused by congestive heart failure or rarely, lung cancer.

, If you try treating your cough at home or take prescribed medications like antibiotics or antifungal treatments, pay attention to how your cough progresses. You should notice gradual relief. If you don't notice any improvements within five to seven days or if the cough is getting worse, contact your doctor.


If you don't respond to treatment, you may be dealing with a more complicated health situation. It's important to get individualized medical care.

Follow your doctor's treatment recommendation.,
Suck on cough drops.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications.,
Take an expectorant.,
Use a cough suppressant.",How to Get Rid of a Deep Cough3," Your doctor will determine what's causing your cough and might prescribe medication. For example, if your cough is caused by a bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or antifungals (if it's a fungal infection).


Be sure to completely follow your doctor's recommended dosing, completing the medication as directed even if you start to feel better before you've finished your course of antibiotics.

, Cough drops can be useful for adults and older children who have a cough. Try getting some cough drops that contain menthol to help soothe your throat and open up your nasal passages.


Do not give cough drops to young children.

, Depending on the cause of your cough, your doctor might recommend that you take an OTC medication like antihistamines, pain relievers, or anti-asthma medications. Take care to read the medication's label for proper dosing and only take medications that specifically address your symptoms. For example, if your only symptom is a cough, you don't need a decongestant or antihistamine.


Avoid using any medication for more than seven days, unless your doctor has instructed you to do so.
Contact your child's doctor for medication recommendations. You may be able to give your child an over-the-counter medication, but it is best to consult your doctor first for specific recommendations.

, Expectorants thin out the mucus and phlegm which lets you cough them up easier. Use an expectorant like Guaifenesin which is available as a liquid, tablet, or capsule and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid taking the expectorant for more than a week.Avoid giving guaifenesin to children under 4 years old. More studies are needed to determine the risks of using guaifenesin while pregnant or nursing., Ask your doctor about taking a cough suppressant since coughing is a natural way for your body to remove irritants and mucus. You might want to take a cough suppressant medication like dextromethorphan if:


You're coughing so much that you can't sleep
You're cough keeps you from concentrating
Your whole body aches from coughing

Choose a natural expectorant.,
Make an herbal expectorant tea.,
Create a steam facial.,
Do a steam facial.,
Suppress your cough.",How to Get Rid of a Deep Cough4," Expectorants are herbs that can increase and thin out secretions which makes it easier to cough up the phlegm. Some of these (like camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol) can also be used to suppress coughs. Easy to find herbal expectorants include:EucalyptusElecampane (Inula)
Slippery Elm
Fennel seed
CamphorGarlic
Hyssop
Lobelia
Mullein
Thyme
Spearmint and peppermint
Ginger
Cayenne pepper and black pepper
Mustard seed

, Steep one teaspoon of dried expectorant herb (or one tablespoon if fresh) in one cup of boiled water for five to 10 minutes. Sip four to six cups of the warm herbal tea throughout the day. If you dislike the taste, you can add honey and lemon. However, do not give honey to children under one year old.


Cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, and mustard seed may be strong and irritate your throat so drink them slowly.
If you are giving these teas to a child, cut the amount of herb by ½ or steep it in two cups of water. You should also consider talking to your doctor before using herbal remedies in children.

, Create an herbal steam using herbs or essential oils to bring the expectorant's antifungal, antibacterial, or antiseptic properties directly to your lungs. Use one drop of essential oil or one to two teaspoons of dried herb for every quart of water. Boil the mixture for one minute and remove it from heat. Use one of these herbs or essential oils:


Eucalyptus
Fennel seed
Camphor
Hyssop
Lobelia
Mullein
Thyme
Spearmint or peppermint (which contain menthol)
Ginger
Coltsfoot
Marshmallow
Slippery elm

, Drape a large clean towel over the back of your head while you lean over the pot of steaming herbal water. Keep your face at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the water so you don't burn yourself and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Repeat this for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming. Cough during the treatment and blow your nose when you're finished.


Reheat the water till it steams and do a facial every two hours or as often as you can.

, Use natural suppressants like camphor, eucalyptus, and honey. Remember, do not give honey to children under one year old. Try taking one tablespoon of honey three times a day to soothe your throat. Or, add one to three drops of camphor, eucalyptus, or menthol into a steam facial, breathing in the fumes. You can also rub a topical ointment that contains camphor and menthol onto your chest and around your nose to suppress your cough.


In general, a cough is a normal way for your body to get rid of mucus and irritants, so you shouldn't always treat it. But, if you're coughing so much that you can't sleep or concentrate, or your body is sore, you can try a natural cough suppressant.

Call a professional pest management company.",How to Prevent Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)2," Check your yard and any exterior buildings or sheds for small pellets of rodent droppings about ¼ – ½"" (0.5 – 1.0cm) in size. You may also see signs of gnawing on wooden boards or rodent tracks in dirt or dust. Small wads of paper or soft material might in fact be the rodent's nest. You may also be able to smell their urine or hear them.If you have mice, you'll see uneaten food since they won't eat everything they find. If you have rats, you might only find inedible things like shells or bones.

, Rodents can make nests out of materials commonly found around houses or sheds. Keep woodpiles at least 100 feet away from your house. If you have hay or garbage cans, place them on a raised pallet that's at least one foot off the ground.Keep any outside compost bins at least 100 feet away from the house.
Trim grass and shrubs so they're short and don't provide a nesting place for rodents.

, Clear away leaves and large bushes from along the baseboards of your house. If you can, cover the baseboards with metal flashing around the base of a wooden, earthen or adobe home. The metal should reach at least 1 foot (0.3 m) above the ground and six inches into the ground.

Dispose of dead rodents.,
Recognize signs of HPS.",How to Prevent Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)3," When cleaning up dead rodents, disinfecting nesting areas or removing droppings, it's important to wear vinyl, latex or rubber gloves. Once you've finished cleaning or disinfecting the space, take off the gloves and disinfect them. Ensure that you wash your hands with hot soapy water when you're done.To disinfect the gloves, wash them with soap and hot water or disinfectant.

, Spray disinfectant on dry areas before you sweep. If you find a rodent-infested area covered with dirt, avoid simply sweeping it up. This will stir up dried feces that you could inhale. Instead, spray a disinfectant all over the area so it's no longer dusty. Then you can carefully sweep up the dirty space.You can use a general or household disinfectant to moisten the area and kill the HPS virus.

, Open windows to ventilate the space. Spray everything in the space with a disinfectant. Soak a towel in the disinfectant and wring it out. Use the towel to pick up any items that were in the space and throw them away. Mop the space or sponge it using the disinfectant.To create a disinfectant, fill a bucket with one gallon of water. Add 1 1/2 cups of bleach and stir it to combine the mixture. This will kill the HPS virus., As an extra precaution, put on a simple face mask. The mask should cover your nose and mouth. While it won't protect you against the virus, it will keep you from breathing in dust or dirt.Use a fresh mask each time you clean a new rodent-infested area. Discard it after you're done cleaning.

, If you find dead rodents, never pick them up with your hands. Instead, spray the rodents and the surrounding area with disinfectant. Use a small scoop or broom to sweep up the rodents. Place the dead rodents, any nesting materials, and your cleaning supplies in a double bag. Seal each bag and bury or burn it. If you can't bury or burn the materials, contact your local health department.You should also place any nesting materials and cleaning supplies in the bag before burying it since nesting materials can also transmit HPS.

, If you get the hantavirus, you should watch for fatigue, fever and muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain). If you experience any of these early signs, get immediate medical attention since HPS symptoms can get worse and even be fatal. Late signs of HPS include:Coughing

Find out if you qualify for a lung transplant.",How to Prevent Emphysema," Tobacco smoke is a recognized cause of emphysema and other forms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), such as chronic bronchitis and asthma.The best way to avoid emphysema is to never start smoking. If you're currently a smoker, quitting can help improve your health, even after years of smoking.Smoking is the cause of emphysema in 80% to 90% of all reported cases.When you quit smoking, your circulation begins to improve immediately. Your lungs will also be able to make some repairs to the damage smoking has caused.
Quit all at once. Smoking at all, even on occasion, will still do damage to your lungs.Write down the reasons why you want to quit and keep that piece of paper in a prominently-visible place. Remind yourself every day why it's worth it to quit.
Try nicotine-replacements like nicotine gum and patches to manage your cravings.
Join a stop-smoking program in your area. Let your friends and relatives know about your decision to quit and ask them for support.Call help hotlines for support any time you're struggling to stay away from tobacco. The Centers for Disease Control recommend that you call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for help and support.;
, Secondhand smoke, which is smoke you inhale from another person's tobacco smoking, is a known environmental cause of emphysema.Among non-smokers who develop emphysema and emphysema-like symptoms, an average of 20% of individuals grew up around other people who smoked.If you live with or spend time with someone who smokes, politely ask him not to smoke in front of you. Let your friends/family members know about your concerns over secondhand smoke.
Ask the smokers you know to smoke outdoors. If you carpool with smokers, ask them to avoid smoking in the car, or (if they refuse) make sure they keep the windows down and blow smoke outside.

, Around 10% to 20% of nonsmokers who develop emphysema are exposed to hazardous conditions in the workplace. You can reduce your chances of developing emphysema and other respiratory problems by limiting exposure to those conditions, or avoiding them altogether whenever possible.Industrial dust is a known cause emphysema. It can come from many materials, including wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica, talc, metal, fiberglass, pesticides, grain, coffee, and drug/enzyme powder.
Smoke from any burning organic material can cause emphysema. Firefighters often develop emphysema due to occupational exposure to smoke.
Gaseous vapors put out by solvents and other liquids can irritate the nose and throat, and can eventually cause emphysema.
Mist from paint, lacquer, hair spray, pesticides, cleaning products, oils, acids, and solvents can all cause emphysema.
Fumes from metal that has been heated and cooled quickly are a frequent cause of emphysema. If you work in welding, smelting, furnaces, pottery, plastics, or rubber manufacturing, take every precaution.

, If you cannot avoid exposure to hazardous conditions in your workplace, you can take safety precautions to at least limit your exposure. Safety equipment like respirators and ventilation systems can help reduce how much of a given hazard your lungs are exposed to.Wear a respirator whenever you're exposed to hazardous conditions. Make sure it's fitted properly so it will work effectively on your face.
Let your supervisor know about your concerns regarding your workplace.
Urge your supervisor to increase ventilation in the workplace.
Ask about other ways you can limit or avoid exposure to the hazardous conditions.
If your supervisor does not take your concerns seriously, try speaking with a higher supervisor or union member (if you are part of a labor union).

, If you are or have been a smoker, if you have a family history of emphysema, or if you work in hazardous conditions, you may be at risk of developing emphysema. By knowing the symptoms, you can prepare yourself by understanding what to look for and when to be concerned.Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms on a regular basis:


Wheezing and shortness of breath
Difficulty performing light exercise, such as climbing stairs
Long-term, hacking cough (often called ""smoker's cough"")
Long-term production of mucus (especially yellow/greenish mucus), If you're concerned about your potential for having acquired emphysema, you may want to test your own lung capacity at home. While this is not a substitute for a proper medical examination, it can help give you some idea of how good or bad your lungs are.Take a full breath and hold it for one second.
Blow out the air as hard and as fast as you're able to.
Your lungs should be completely empty in under six seconds.
If it takes you longer than six seconds to completely empty your lungs, you may have some type of obstruction or limitation on your airways' capacity to breathe.

, If you notice any symptoms of emphysema and you've been having a hard time breathing, it's important to get checked out right away. While there is no cure for emphysema, getting treatment early on and making the necessary lifestyle changes can help slow the progression of emphysema and may improve your quality of life.Your doctor will run tests to determine if emphysema is the cause of your symptoms.
X-rays, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas tests, electrocardiograms, spirometry, and pulmonary function tests are all common ways your doctor might diagnose or rule out emphysema.
No at-home diagnosis can substitute for a doctor's evaluation. Talk to your doctor right away about any concerns you have regarding your risk of emphysema.

, Bronchodilators are usually administered as a hand-held inhaler. They relieve the symptoms of emphysema by relaxing the muscles in and around your airways, allowing the airways to open more fully so that breathing comes easier.There are two main types of bronchodilators: short-acting and long-acting medications. Both forms can cause trembling, headaches, dry mouth, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, coughing, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.The most common bronchodilators include:


Beta-2 agonists — these medications are usually taken through an inhaler. Common beta-2 agonists include salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol, and vilanterol.
Anticholinergics/antimuscarinics — these medications are administered via inhaler. Common medicines in this class include ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium.
Theophylline — this class of medicine is usually taken orally as a tablet or capsule, though intravenous versions are available for severe emergencies.

, Anti-inflammatory medications reduce swelling/inflammation in your airways. These medicines can be administered as an inhaled steroid, an oral steroid, or an inhaled non-steroid.However, prolonged use of anti-inflammatory medications over time may cause osteoporosis, hypertension, elevated blood sugar, and redistribution of fat in the body.The most common inhaled steroids are Beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent, Vanceril), Fluticasone propionate (Flovent), Flunisolide (AeroBid), Budesonide (Pulmicort), Mometasone (Asmanex), and Ciclesonide (Alvesco).
Common side effects of inhaled steroids include coughing, sore throat, hoarseness, and mouth infections like thrush.
The most common oral steroids are Methylprednisolone (Medrol), Prednisolone (Prelone), Prednisone (Deltasone), Hydrocortisone (Cortef), and Dexamethasone.
Common side effects of oral steroids include an increase in appetite, mood swings, muscle weakness, skin blemishes, sweating or swelling, elevated blood pressure, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of infection.
The most common inhaled steroids are Cromolyn sodium (Intal) and Nedocromil sodium (Tilade).
Common side effects of inhaled steroids include coughing, dry throat, nausea, and mouth infections like thrush. They can also leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth.

, Many people with emphysema develop bacterial infections such as acute bronchitis and pneumonia. If this happens, your doctor will prescribe you a course of antibiotics to help you fight the bacterial infection.Mild to moderate emphysema-related infections are typically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium.
Severe emphysema-related infections may be treated with penicillin, fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides., Pulmonary rehabilitation classes teach you techniques that you can employ at home to reduce your emphysema symptoms. These programs typically focus on breathing exercises and different breathing techniques that can make respiration easier.Ask your doctor about pulmonary rehabilitation programs in your area. Your doctor's office may even organize such programs, and if not, your doctor should be able to refer you to one.

, Oxygen therapy involves receiving higher volumes of oxygen through a machine. The oxygen is usually administered through either a full face mask or a nasal tube.This is the one of the few medical treatments that actual prolongs the lifespan in COPD patients; other treatments only reduce symptoms or make the patient more comfortable.

, If you've recently been diagnosed with emphysema, your doctor may advise you to lose weight. Alternately, if you're in the late stages of emphysema, your doctor may recommend that you gain additional weight. Taking specialized courses in nutrition that are designed for individuals with emphysema can help you manage your weight, whether that means gaining or losing pounds.Ask your doctor for nutritional advice, and find out if there are any nutrition therapy programs in your area.

, As emphysema progresses, parts of your lungs may become damaged beyond repair. These damaged areas can make it more difficult to breathe, and they may restrict your lung capacity. When you opt for lung volume reduction surgery, a surgeon will carefully remove some of the damaged portions in very small wedges. This allows the rest of your lung tissue to expand, making breathing come easier and more efficiently.This surgery, as with oxygen therapy, can prolong the patient's life, not just treat symptoms.Not everyone is eligible for surgery. Ask your doctor if you meet the criteria., For very severe emphysema, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant if no other options have worked.This is a very serious and potentially dangerous surgery in which your chest will be opened up and a donor's lung transplanted into your own body. There may be certain qualifications for this procedure, including having an advanced stage of emphysema. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this and other options for your emphysema.

Look for an inability to swallow.,
Monitor for aspiration pneumonia.,
Keep an eye out for bad breath.,
Identify regurgitation.,
Be aware of coughing.,
Feel pain in your neck.",How to Diagnose Esophageal Diverticulum1," Esophageal diverticula are small pocket-like pouches that can catch food. This may cause you to feel as if you have food caught in your throat. This is the most common symptom of esophageal diverticulum.The feeling of being unable to swallow properly is clinically described as dysphagia.
An inability to swallow might be due to pain in the throat or esophagus as food pushes on the diverticula. If the pain is severe, it might cause you to eat less, which could lead to weight loss.;
, Aspiration pneumonia is a lung infection that develops due to inhaled food, liquid, or vomit. The food, vomit, or liquid lodges in the lungs, usually when the person lies down and the substance is regurgitated, and leads to infection. Common signs of aspiration pneumonia include:Chest pain
Trouble swallowing
Fever
Coughing
Trouble breathing

, Bad breath (halitosis) is commonly associated with esophageal diverticulum. This is due to the fact that as food collects in the diverticula, it rots and decays. The rotten food lodged in the throat may lead to bad breath and/or a bad taste in the mouth., Regurgitation refers to the process of already-consumed food returning from the esophagus or stomach. If you notice food in your mouth that you already ate, you might have esophageal diverticulum. You might also find food on your pillow when you wake in the morning., Coughing is the process of roughly exhaling in order to clear the throat or lungs. It is an involuntary action that often accompanies esophageal diverticulum. As a result, you might find your throat becomes sore or your voice becomes hoarse. You might also cough during the night, waking your partner or even yourself.Your coughing might be due to pulmonary aspiration — the movement of foreign material or secretions into the trachea (windpipe) and/or lungs., Pain in the neck related to esophageal diverticulum might occur on the sides, front, or back of the neck. In the case of large diverticula, especially, you are likely to experience pain the neck, especially when swallowing."

Visit your doctor.,
Try a barium swallow.,
Get a gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.,
Have an esophageal manometry.,
Check for GERD.",How to Diagnose Esophageal Diverticulum2," Only your doctor is qualified to determine if you have esophageal diverticulum based on an analysis of your symptoms and a medical examination. When speaking with your doctor, provide them with clear and concise descriptions of each symptom.Always provide specifics. The more information your doctor has, the better the diagnosis they can provide.
For instance, if you're coughing, feeling pain in your neck, and regurgitating food, you might say, “I am feeling pain in my neck on the left side.” You might then gesture to the exact location that hurts. You might then say, “I cough frequently during meals, and sometimes awake coughing during the night.” You might continue to explain, “When I awake, sometimes I notice bits of regurgitated food on the pillow beside me.”

, A barium swallow involves consuming a chalky mixture containing barium sulfate, a metallic compound. The doctor will then take an X-ray to track the movement of the barium through your throat and esophagus.This helps the doctor determine whether your esophagus is functioning properly and detect diverticula or other potential problems. Alternatively, your doctor may ask you to eat a food or pill coated with barium to track its movement., An endoscopy involves passing a long, narrow tube with a small camera on the end down the esophagus. The camera feed then provides your doctor with a view inside the esophagus to locate and diagnose any esophageal diverticulum that may be present. You will probably be sedated during your endoscopy.Before the endoscopy, you’ll have to go without food and drink for at least eight hours.The doctor will probably spray an anesthetic in your throat and you will be asked to wear a mouthguard to prevent you from biting the endoscope (the small camera tube used to examine your insides).
Since you’ll likely be sedated, you’ll need someone to drive you home.
Your doctor will provide more specific instruction regarding how to prepare for your endoscopy.

, An esophageal manometry is a procedure which tests the esophagus for proper operation. It involves passing a long tube known as a catheter down your nose, through the esophagus, and (possibly) into the stomach. If you’re demonstrating symptoms associated with esophageal diverticulum, your doctor may want to ensure your esophagus is functioning properly.The manometry begins with you receiving a numbing spray on your throat and/or nose.
The catheter is then guided through the nose and into the esophagus. This might cause you to gag or make your eyes water.
Your doctor might ask you to sit or lie down.
You will then swallow water and the catheter records the pressure and strength of your esophagus’ response.Your doctor will provide you with more details about how you can best prepare for the procedure.

, 24-hour pHmetry is a test in which a thin tube designed to detect acid is passed through the nose and down the esophagus. The other end of the tube is connected to a small monitoring device. The bit of tube that comes out of your nose will be taped in place to the side of your face. Wear the device for 24 hours, pressing certain buttons on the device to monitor events of interest to your medical team.For instance, you might need to record each time you eat or drink, or each time you lie down and get up. Your doctor will explain in more detail how to use your particular pH monitoring device.During the monitoring period, eat at least two meals a day. Avoid snacking and sucking on lozenges or hard candy. Do not chew gum during the monitoring period. Try not to lie down until you go to bed.
There are many medications that you cannot take during the period prior to your 24-hour acid monitoring. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers, for instance, at off limits for seven days and 48 hours, respectively. Additionally, do not take antacids for at least six hours prior to the 24-hour pHmetry.
Once your 24-hour period is complete, you will have to return to your doctor. Do not eat or drink anything for the six hours prior to your follow-up visit.
GERD may also be diagnosed by describing your symptoms to your doctor and receiving an endoscopy.

"
"
Adopt lifestyle changes.,
Get surgery.,
Treat the underlying disorder.",How to Diagnose Esophageal Diverticulum3," Treatment of esophageal diverticulum is typically unnecessary. The easiest way to deal with esophageal diverticulum is to eat a blander diet, chew food more thoroughly, and drink lots of water to wash your food down after eating.For instance, avoid spicy seasonings and sauces like chili flakes, paprika, and sriracha. Do not consume hot peppers like jalapeno or habanero.
Most people should drink about eight glasses of water each day. If you have esophageal diverticula, try drinking 12 or more glasses of water per day to help flush out food that might be stuck in your diverticula. Drinking more could prove especially helpful during and after meals.
Try chewing each bite of food around 20 – 25 times to prevent it from getting stuck in the diverticula.

, Diverticula may require removal if they are too large or lead to serious symptoms. There are several types of surgical procedures that might be used to treat your esophageal diverticulum. Your doctor will decide which procedure is best for you.The type of surgery required for your particular diverticula depends on its location and size, as well as your own health.Your surgeon will discuss your options with you.
If you have small diverticula, you might get a cricopharyngeal myotomy. This procedure requires going in through the mouth to remove diverticula.
If you have larger diverticula, your doctor might recommend a diverticulopexy with cricopharyngeal myotomy. In this procedure, the diverticula is turned upside down and then sutured to the esophageal wall.
A third surgery option is the diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeal myotomy. If you get this procedure, the surgeon will remove the entire diverticula.
The fourth and final surgery option is the endoscopic diverticulotomy (Dohlman procedure). In this surgery, the surgeon slices the diverticula down the middle, allowing food to drain out of it., In cases where your diverticula are only a secondary symptom caused by some other medical condition, treat that disease first before dealing with the diverticula. Otherwise, other diverticula may develop. In the case of esophageal diverticulum, you may have an issue with your esophageal sphincter, or you could have GERD.For instance, if you have GERD, you will need to utilize antacids and medications that block or reduce acid production. You can also use over-the-counter medications to deal with chest pain and related symptoms. If necessary, get surgery to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. Working in concert with your doctor, you can manage your GERD and only then solve the esophageal diverticula that developed as a secondary symptom.
Your doctor will be able to identify whether your esophageal diverticulum is the product of an underlying condition.

Reduce your exposure to irritants.,
Exercise on a routine basis.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Try not to breathe cold air.,
Keep up with annual vaccinations.,
Join a support group.,
See your doctor.,
Ask about available medications.,
Look into a pulmonary rehabilitation regimen.,
Follow your doctor’s advice regarding nutrition therapy.,
Ask about oxygen therapy.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical options.",How to Treat Emphysema," One of the single biggest steps you can take to prevent emphysema (or slow the progression if you’ve already been diagnosed with the condition) is to stop smoking. Smoking tobacco (or marijuana) subjects the lungs to irritants that have a long-term, detrimental effect on your lungs.Other irritants that can progress the disease include air pollution and manufacturing fumes.If you are addicted to tobacco, then you may have much more success in stopping smoking by looking into over-the-counter or prescription cessation medications. You can also make other lifestyle changes that help break your mental addiction to smoking. Find other information about smoking cessation at How to Quit Smoking.
Ensure that you change your furnace and air conditioner filters regularly to help reduce irritants in your home as well.;
, Begin slowly, but find a regular exercise routine that gets your heart rate up. Exercise can slow the deterioration of your lungs and increase your lung capacity.Try a cardio routine that includes walking, jogging, jumping rope or low-impact options like cycling and water aerobics.Don’t push yourself too hard at first since the exercise will make it even harder for you to breathe, especially initially before you begin increasing your lung capacity.

, A healthy weight places less stress on your lungs as you breathe. A healthy weight also makes you less prone to respiratory infections that can complicate your condition. Maintain a healthy diet that avoids simple carbohydrates (sweets) and trans-fats or saturated fats (butter and fried foods).Some people living with emphysema have found that diets with more monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats (the ""good"" fats) and fewer carbohydrates make it easier to breathe.See a professional dietician before attempting to later your diet in this way.
You can find more information on developing better eating habits at How to Eat Healthy.

, In addition to its other health benefits, drinking plenty of water will help thin the excess mucus associated with emphysema, making it easier to remove.Aim to drink six to eight glasses spread across your entire day as opposed to in a short time period.

, This will be difficult, especially if you live in areas with cold winters, but frigid air can cause your bronchial passages to spasm, increasing the difficulty of breathing even further.Placing a cold-air mask or even a warm scarf over your mouth before exposing yourself to the cold can help warm the air as you inhale., Keeping up with pneumonia and flu shots is especially important since respiratory infections will hit you even harder than those with healthy lungs. Your doctor will advise you on a schedule for pneumonia vaccinations.You may also consider wearing a face mask when exposed to large groups of people during cold and flu season to help reduce your risk of infection.The 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for everyone over the age of 65 and for those who are younger with risk factors that increase their likelihood of getting the infection.
Flu shots are approved for use in people as young as six months and up. You will need to get a flu shot every season.

, Emphysema is a serious condition that will affect your quality of life as it progresses. Trying to maintain your emotional wellbeing and keeping a positive outlook can be just as important as maintaining your physical health. Look online and locally for support groups where you can meet others to discuss treatment options and coping strategies.The local chapter of the American Lung Association in your area will also have information regarding support groups., There is a wide assortment of options available to help treat or slow the progression of emphysema.The first step is to see your doctor who will perform tests to determine your current lung function and help come up with the best treatment plan for you.

, A few different medication options are available to help relieve symptoms such as wheezing or difficulty breathing.These options include:Bronchodilators — Bronchodilators work by dilating your airway muscles, causing them to open and allow more oxygen. This decreases wheezing. There are both short and long acting bronchodilators. Both beta agonist and anticholinergic medications are utilized. Examples include Albuterol, Xopenex, and Atrovent.Inhaled Corticosteroids — These work by decreasing the inflammation involved with COPD to help relieve shortness of breath. Studies have shown that inhaled glucocorticoids reduce exacerbations and modestly decrease the progression of respiratory symptoms. Combination treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids significantly improves response to therapy and improves outcomes. Examples are Pulmicort (budesonide), Flovent (fluticasone), Aerobid (flunisolide), and Asmanex (mometasone).Mucolytics — These drugs (such as Mucomyst) thin mucus, making it easier to cough up. This helps reduce flare ups.Oral Steroids — These options work systemically to decrease the inflammation on a systemic level. They are useful in treating COPD exacerbation (flare up complications triggered by pollutants, respiratory infections, etc.), making them an acute option rather than part of your normal regimen.For stubborn inflammation, oral theophylline and PDE-4 inhibitors may be used.

, Pulmonary rehabilitation therapy is an important part of managing the disease. Most notably, it includes meetings with a therapist who will teach you better breathing techniques and exercises.Breathing techniques include exhaling through pursed lips to slow your breathing and keep your airways open for a longer duration, as well as diaphragmatic (belly) breathing to help strengthen your diaphragm.Pulmonary rehab has a cascading effect as well since it helps you maintain an aerobic exercise regimen that will also slow the progression of the condition., Since reaching an ideal weight can take time for those who are overweight, your physician will likely suggest advanced steps toward that goal.Those with late-stage emphysema often have trouble maintaining an ideal weight due to becoming underweight, so nutrition therapy services are designed to help with both ends of the spectrum., In the later stages of emphysema, you may find it too difficult to breathe on your own during your worst flare ups. Your physician can prescribe supplemental oxygen in a variety of forms, including tanks that you can use at home.Delivery of the oxygen is typically through a narrow piece of tubing that you place in your nostrils.For most patients, you will aim for an oxygen saturation of 88–92%.While late stage patients use a supplemental oxygen delivery system twenty-four hours a day, this isn’t the only purpose. Your doctor may simply prescribe a system for you to wear while you run on the treadmill to ensure that you’re maintaining an exercise routine., If other treatment options don’t help control your symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgical options. Surgical options to discuss include:Lung-volume reduction surgery (LVRS) — During this procedure, your surgeon will remove small wedges of your damaged lung to help your healthier lung tissue expand and work more effectively. A bullectomy is a similar type of surgery that removes only the malformed tissue structures called “bullae.”
Lung transplant — Some candidates may qualify for a place on a lung transplant list; however, lung transplants require meeting a range of criteria, not limited to the availability of a lung donor."

Take care of mild cases.,
Deal with moderate cases.,
Seek help for severe cases.,
Take the right antibiotics.,
Treat hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).",How to Treat Pneumonia1," If you have a mild case of pneumonia, you will be treated as an outpatient. If the patient is a child, she may be admitted to the hospital if the doctor thinks it may get worse. Your doctor will start you on an antibiotic regimen. Your doctor will also suggest rest and increased sleep in order to get better as quickly as possible. Even in mild cases, you should not go to school or work until your doctor says you can. Total recovery is generally seven to 10 days.


Some types of pneumonia are highly contagious, while others are only passed to others under optimal conditions.When you are diagnosed, ask your doctor about how contagious your particular pneumonia is, and for how long you will be considered contagious.You should see a significant improvement in your symptoms within 48 hours of treatment. This means you should no longer have a fever and have an overall increase in strength.
There is no need for special care when cleaning up after a patient with pneumonia. The germs that cause it are not viable on inanimate objects for any substantial time frame and will be removed with normal washing.;
, Moderate cases of pneumonia are those with significant respiratory compromise and require supplemental oxygen to keep their oxygen saturation up. These patients will also have fever and overall sickly appearance. If this is how your pneumonia manifests, you will likely be admitted to inpatient wards to receive intravenous antibiotics. The kind of antibiotics you get will not change, they will just be in IV form in order to get the drugs into your system faster.


You will be changed to oral antibiotics as your fever breaks and you become responsive to therapy. This typically takes no more than 48 hours.
The treatment from here follows the same for mild cases, because the case has transitioned from moderate to mild., Severe cases of pneumonia are those with patients who are going through respiratory failure. This requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. It may also require being admitted to the intensive care unit.Like with moderate cases, IV antibiotics are required. These cases often require vasopressor support with pressors (medications which raise your blood pressure) to counter the effects of septic shock.
While in the hospital, you will need supportive care to improve your general health while the medications do their work. Once you improve, you will follow the care for moderate and then mild cases as you get better. The length of your hospital stay will depend on the severity of the damage to your lungs and how bad your case of pneumonia was.Your doctor may utilize bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in select patients to prevent intubation and traditional mechanical ventilation.BiPAP is a non-invasive way to deliver pressurized air to a patient, often used to treat sleep apnea., There are a few different antibiotics that you can take if you get pneumonia. Your doctor will determine which kind of pathogen caused your pneumonia, which will then determine which medicine you take. For the most common forms of pneumonia, antibiotics such as zithromax or doxycycline are combined with amoxicillin, augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, or cefotaxime. The dosage will depend on the age and severity of your case, as well as your allergies and the culture results.


You doctor may prescribe the less common but effective single antibiotic therapy route, which is a respiratory quinolone such as Levaquin or Avelox for adults.Quinolones not indicated for pediatric populations.
In moderate cases and mild cases on the verge of hospitalization, your doctor may give you a rocephin IV followed with the oral regimen.
In all these cases, your doctor will follow up within a few days to see how your symptoms are progressing., Patients that get HAP are already dealing with health issues. This makes their treatment a little different than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), though these methods may be used in rare and severe cases of CAP. HAP can be caused by many different types of pathogens, so your doctor will determine which kind you have and then administer the antibiotics according to the pathogen infecting your. The common treatments are:


For Klebsiella and E Coli, IV antibiotics such as quinolone, ceftazidime, or ceftriaxone
For Pseudomonas, IV antibiotics and imipenem, piperacillin, or cefepime
For Staph Aureus or MRSA, IV antibiotics such as vancomycin
For fungal pneumonias, IV antibiotics such as Amphotericin B or Diflucan IV
For vancomycin resistant enterococcus: IV antibiotics of Ceftaroline"

Get a biopsy.,
Determine the stage of cancer.,
Identify the type of lung cancer.,
Create a treatment plan.",How to Treat Lung Cancer1," Before you can start any kind of treatment for lung cancer, you need to get a biopsy of the lung. A biopsy will let your doctor know that you have cancer and what type of cancer you have.During a biopsy, the doctor will get a small tissue sample of your lung. They can do this through a needle, a tube sent into the lungs, through the chest wall, or through an incision. After they get the tissue sample, they check the sample under a microscope for cancerous cells.;
, Lung cancer is divided into four different stages. Stages refer to the severity of the cancer. The stage of lung cancer you have may influence your treatment options.Stage I cancer is when the area affected by the cancer is small. It is usually only in one area of the lung. Surgery is often used to treat this stage of cancer.
Stage II and III is when the cancer has progressed and infected a larger area of the lungs. The cancer may have spread to surrounding tissues. The cancer may also be in the lymph nodes. A combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation is common for stage II and III cancers.Stage IV is the most advanced stage of cancer. This means the cancer has spread beyond the lungs into other parts of the body. For stage IV lung cancer, all treatments are options for helping you live longer and reducing any symptoms., If you have lung cancer, you can have either a carcinoid tumor, small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Most lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer grows more quickly than the other type.Small cell lung cancer generally responds better to chemotherapy. Non-small cell lung cancer is treated with various types of treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, among others.
Carcinoid tumors are rare and slow-growing and often show no symptoms until the late stages.

, After you are diagnosed with lung cancer, you will work with a multidisciplinary cancer care team to come up with your treatment plan. This team consists of different doctors, oncology nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, dietitians, counselors, or other health care professionals.Your doctors will work together to come up with a plan of care for your treatment. You may decide to use a combination of treatments, depending on your specific case.
Your treatment plan will be based on the type and stage of lung cancer you have, the location of the cancer, your overall health, and what you approve to be done.If you do not feel your doctors are working together or communicating, speak with them. If you feel uncomfortable with your team, go get a second opinion or find a new set of doctors.

Take the flu shot.,
Wash your hands often.,
Take care of yourself.,
Try vitamins and minerals.",How to Treat Pneumonia2," Pneumonia can be caused when influenza is contracted and becomes advanced. Because of this, it is recommended that you get the flu shot every year. Since this helps fight against the flu, it will help fight against pneumonia as well.


The flu shot can be taken by anyone over the age of six months.
There is a special vaccine that can be taken by children younger than two and also one for those two to five years old who are at increased risk of pneumonia. Children who go to communal day care should also get the vaccine.There is also a vaccine for those without spleens, over the age of 65, with lung disease such as asthma and COPD, and with sickle cell anemia.

, If you want to avoid getting pneumonia, you need to avoid coming into contact with the viruses and germs that cause it. You can do this through proper hand washing. If you are in public or around someone you know is sick, you should wash your hands as much as possible. Also avoid putting your unclean hands near your face in order to prevent the spread of unwashed germs from your hands to your system. To wash your hands properly, you need to:


Turn on the faucet and wet your hands.
Apply soap to your hands and scrub every part of your finger. This includes under the nails, on the backs of your hands, and between your fingers.
Keep rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds, which is how long it takes to sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song all the way through twice.
Rinse your hands in the water to rinse off the soap. Make sure the water is warm to help remove the soap and germs.
Dry them off with a clean towel., A great way to prevent contracting pneumonia is to be in the best overall health you can be. This means you need to stay in shape physically and mentally. Try to exercise every day, eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and get enough sleep. These things all benefit your health and will keep your immune system in the best shape it can be, which will help you stay as healthy as possible.


Many people think they can skimp off sleep and still be healthy. Studies have been done that link the wellbeing of your immune system to the amount of sleep you get each night. The more high-quality sleep, which is uninterrupted sleep in a sleep-conducive environment, you get a night, the healthier your immune system will be., There are some supplements that you can take to boost your overall immune health. One of the best to help pneumonia is Vitamin C. Take between 1000 to 2000 mg every day. You can get this from citrus fruit, citrus juice, broccoli, watermelon, cantaloupe, and many other fruits and vegetables.Zinc is helpful if you feel like you are getting a cold, which can turn into pneumonia. At the first sign of symptoms, take 150 mg of zinc three times a day."

Learn the types.,
Recognize the symptoms of pneumonia.,
Diagnose CAP.,
Seek immediate medical attention.",How to Treat Pneumonia3," Pneumonia is divided into two broad types that are caused by different things and are treated differently — community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which will be discussed later. CAP consists pneumonia caused by typical bacteria, atypical bacteria, and respiratory viruses.


CAP is the kind of pneumonia most people contract in their daily lives. CAP is more dangerous in the elderly, the very young, and those with a compromised immune system, such as those with diabetes, with HIV, on chemotherapy, and taking steroid medications. CAP can range from a mild case treated at home to a case with acute respiratory failure and death., The symptoms of pneumonia can vary from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the pneumonia and how badly the patient is infected. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor immediately to get treated. The longer you wait, the worse you can get. Symptoms of CAP include:A productive cough
Mucus with a thick texture, which may be green, yellow, or red tinged
Severe chest pain when a deep breath is taken
Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C), but often 101 to 102°F (38.3 to 38.9°C)
Chills or involuntary shaking
Shortness of breath, which can be mild to severe
Rapid breathing, which is more common in child cases
Drop in oxygen saturation in the lungs

, When you see your doctor, they will check for all the common symptoms. In addition to this, he or she will also take a chest radiograph, which will show how your lungs are affected. If your doctor see an area of white patchy consolidation on a lobe of the lung, which should usually be black, you likely have pneumonia. There may be a parapneumonic effusion, or collection of fluid, adjacent to the area of infection.


Blood tests are not typically needed in mild cases of pneumonia. However, if your case is more advanced, your doctor may take labs such as a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a mucus specimen, and cultures. , There are certain circumstances in which you may need to see immediate medical care. Even if you have been treated, you should seek immediate medical help if your symptoms get worse. Get to a doctor or emergency room as soon as possible if:You become confused about time, people or places
Your nausea and vomiting prevent you from keeping down oral antibiotics
Your blood pressure drops
Your breathing is rapid
You need breathing assistance
Your temperature is higher than 102°F (38.9°C)
Your temperature is below normal

Know about hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).,
Recognize the risks of hospital acquired pneumonia.,
Learn the causes of hospital acquired pneumonia.,
Avoid hospital-acquired pneumonia.",How to Treat Pneumonia4," HAP occurs in patients who contract pneumonia while hospitalized. HAP refers to pneumonia that patients acquire while in the hospital. This strain is typically very severe and is accompanied by high death rates. It accounts for up to 2% of all rehospitalizations. It happens to all kinds of hospital patients, from those who are getting surgery to those who had a fall to those already with a serious infection. Hospital acquired pneumonia can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure, and death.The symptoms of hospital acquired pneumonia are the same, since they are both types of the same disease.

, Community acquired pneumonia is spread through the transmission of common pathogens. Hospital acquired pneumonia, however, is spread within a hospital. There are some patients that are more at risk than others based on their condition, though anyone in a hospital can contract HAP. These risk factors include:Being in the ICU
Being on a mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more
Staying at the hospital or ICU for an extended time
Those with severe issues with their underlying issues when they were originally hospitalized
Those with heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, COPD, and diabetes

, Hospital acquired pneumonia can occur through complications after surgery, such as a post surgery collapsed lung or from not taking enough deep breaths due to pain. It can also occur due to poor hygiene from the medical staff at the hospital, especially while caring for patients with central lines, those one ventilator care, and those having a breathing tube placed or replaced., HAP can be avoided through excellent hygiene amongst healthcare providers, meticulous ventilator care, and post-operative use of incentive spirometers, which are devices that encourage deep breathing among post surgical patients. It can also be avoided if a person gets out of bed faster after surgery and if any intubations are removed as soon as possible. "

Undergo surgery.,
Get chemotherapy.,
Undergo radiation therapy.,
Look into other treatments.,
Think about targeted therapy.",How to Treat Lung Cancer2," Surgery is one common treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Surgery is an option if you have stage I or stage II cancer or some stage III lung cancers. During surgery, the cancerous tumor is removed. To do this, the surgeon has to remove the part of the lung that contains the tumor.Depending on how big the tumor is, the surgeon may only take a small section of the lung or they might take the whole lobe or the entire lung.
Usually the nearby lymph nodes will be removed as well. These lymph nodes will be checked for cancer cells.
Removing the entire lobe is often chosen over removing a small section. Removing the entire lobe has a higher chance of curing the cancer.
If there are cancer cells near the edge of the tissue removed during the surgery, you may (rarely) need a second surgery to go back and get any remaining cancerous tissue.
Some people cannot undergo surgery due to poor health.Surgery is used most often with non-small cell lung cancer., Chemotherapy is used for all stages of non-small cell lung cancer. It may be used after surgery, along with radiation, or for advanced stage cancer that has spread. Chemotherapy uses medication to kill cancer cells or prevent them from dividing, which keeps the cells from growing. Chemotherapy treatment is either done orally, intravenously, through an injection into a muscle, or placed directly into the affected area of the body.The type of chemotherapy you will receive depends on the stage and type of cancer. You may be given a combination of different drugs.
Chemotherapy usually takes weeks or months of treatments.In early stages of cancer (stage II), chemotherapy can help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Chemotherapy is most often used with small cell lung cancer, along with radiation therapy., Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, is a common cancer treatment. During radiation, high-powered x-rays, proton beams, and other radiation are used to stop the growth and destroy cancer cells. Radiation can be done externally by placing the machine over the affected area. It can be done internally by introducing radioactive substances into the body near the cancer through needles, seeds, wires, or catheters.Radiation may be the only treatment used to treat your cancer.
Radiation may be used in conjunction with other therapies. For example, you may have radiation before you have surgery to shrink the size of the tumor, or you may have it after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.
Radiation is also used when cancer spreads to other parts of the body to treat cancer in those areas., There are other less common treatments for non-small cell lung cancer that you can consider. These alternatives may be used if a patient can’t have surgery, can’t undergo anesthesia, cancer has come back, or in advanced cancer cases. These treatments may not be available in all hospitals.Photodynamic therapy uses a combination of drugs and laser lights to target cancer cells.
Laser therapy is when a laser beam is used to target and kill cancer cells.
Cryosurgery utilizes a special instrument. This instrument freezes and kills cancerous tissues.

, Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment. In this treatment, you are given medication that helps contain cancer cells by stopping them from growing and spreading.This type of therapy may be better because it has been shown to be less harmful to normal, healthy cells than standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy.Chemotherapy drugs stop all cells from replicating, including cancer cells, which is effective in killing cancer cells; however, because they affect all cells, healthy cells are also stopped from replicating when they need to. This causes severe side effects. Targeted therapy leaves healthy cells alone while fighting only cancer cells.
Targeted therapy fights cancer-causing processes in cancer cells; however, targeted therapy is not strong enough yet to kill the cancer cells alone. That means usually it is used in combination with chemotherapy to stop cancer cells and kill them. Because fewer chemotherapy drugs are used, the side effects are less than if you were just receiving chemotherapy.
Targeted therapy can be taken orally or given intravenously.

Get a second opinion.,
Look into cancer centers.,
Become part of a clinical trial.,
Find help.",How to Treat Lung Cancer3," If you are unhappy with the treatment options that your doctor or care team has given you, get a second opinion. There is no harm in getting checked out by a different doctor and gaining more insight into your condition and treatment options.Don’t feel that you have to stick with a doctor just because you went to them first. Don’t think that you can’t question what a doctor says because they are the doctor. Ask questions about anything you don’t understand, and talk to your care team if you feel uncomfortable with something.
A second opinion may give you more confidence about your treatment decision and make the process better for you.

, Instead of going to a hospital, you may choose to go to a cancer center. Cancer centers have the same medical personnel as a hospital. This includes a surgeon, oncologist, radiologist, oncology nurses, and other professionals. You may have cancer care centers in your area, or the best lung cancer care may be through the oncology department at your hospital.You may consider visiting a cancer center for a second opinion.

, Clinical trials are treatment options you may consider. During a clinical trial, you will be given a new cancer treatment. Your condition will be evaluated to see if the new treatment was safe, effective, or better than the normal treatment. You can find lists of clinical trials online.Clinical trials occur at different parts of treatment. Some clinical trials require people who have never had treatment. Others want patients who have have treatment but seen no improvement, or those who have recurring cancers. Other may focus only on reducing side effects.
Clinical trials are a huge part of the cancer research process. Many cancer treatments used today were first tested through clinical trials.

, There are different resources you can use to help you as you decide on a treatment plan. Though your cancer care team is your main help, you may want to reach out to others for clarification or help. Many cancer organizations provide help and resources that can be useful.For example, the American Cancer Society provides a 24-hour service to provide support for people dealing with cancer. They also help find rides and lodging, and offer support groups.

See your doctor.,
Try over-the-counter medication.,
Take prescription medications.,
Try immunotherapy.,
Irrigate your sinuses.",How to Treat Health Problems from Mold1," If you're experiencing health problems caused by mold exposure, it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Your doctor will run tests, assess your symptoms, and recommend a treatment plan that most likely includes medication.Your doctor may run tests to check for allergies, including a skin prick test and a blood test.
Call ahead to find out if there are any restrictions for your appointment. For example, your doctor may instruct you to discontinue any allergy medication in the days leading up to your appointment.Follow your doctor's instructions. Take any medication that you're given and make follow-up appointments as needed.;
, The best way to alleviate respiratory ailments caused by mold is to use medication. You can find over-the-counter (OTC) medications at your local pharmacy, though you may need prescription-strength medicine from your doctor.OTC antihistamines like loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), and cetirizine (Zyrtec) may help reduce some of your symptoms.
OTC nasal corticosteroids like ciclesonide (Omnaris), fluticasone (Flonase), and mometasone (Nasonex) can help reduce respiratory inflammation and are available. Common side effects include dry nostrils and nosebleeds.
OTC decongestant nasal sprays like oxymetazoline (Afrin) help reduce stuffiness, but they should not be used for more than three or four days or your symptoms may worsen. Common side effects include headaches, insomnia, and nervousness.

, Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor may recommend prescription-strength medications.You should follow your doctor's instructions and adhere to the dosing schedule written on your prescription.


Prescription-strength antihistamines like azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase) may help relieve some of your symptoms.
Montelukast (Singulair) is a prescription-strength medication that can help suppress your immune system's response to allergens like mold.
Prescription-strength antifungal medications like voriconazole or caspofungin may be used to treat aggressive, invasive pulmonary mold problems., In immunotherapy, your doctor will administer a series of allergy shots to reduce your symptoms. However, immunotherapy can only be used for certain types of mold problems. Talk to your doctor if you think immunotherapy might be right for you., Irrigating your sinuses with a saline rinse can help flush out environmental irritants (such as mold spores) and soothe your irritated, inflamed nostrils and sinus cavity.Nasal irrigation can be performed every day to help relieve the symptoms caused by your mold problem.


You should only irrigate your sinuses with a squeeze bottle, bulb syringe, or neti pot designed to be used exclusively for nasal/sinus treatment.
Only use distilled or sterile water. You can also boil and cool water, or use a filter with a pore size smaller than one micron to ensure that no microorganisms are present.
Mix three large teaspoons of canning salt and one rounded teaspoon of baking soda.This will provide you with enough saline mix to make several batches of the nasal solution.
Add between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon of saline mix to 1/2 cup (four ounces) of warm distilled or sterile water. Stir until it is completely dissolved, then administer it using your bottle, bulb syringe, or neti pot.

Keep track of symptoms.,
Make regular appointments with your doctor.,
Undergo tests.,
Ask about antacids.,
Consider surgery if treatment worsens.",How to Treat Esophageal Diverticulum1," Most of the time esophageal diverticulum presents no symptoms. That said, even if you have had no symptoms in the past, the pockets in your esophagus may grow larger, and new symptoms may appear over time. If your symptoms change, notify your doctor. Typical side effects and symptoms include:Regurgitation of food
Trouble swallowing (dysphagia)
Chest pain
Pneumonia
Excessive clearing of throat
Bad breath (halitosis)
Coughing
Weight loss;
, In most cases, esophageal diverticulum requires no special treatment. You should still have regular check-ups at least once or twice a year with your doctor to make sure that none of the pockets have grown larger.


A gastroenterologist may be most helpful when diagnosing and treating esophageal diverticulum. You can ask your general physician for a recommendation. If your condition is severe, you may have to contact a thoracic surgeon.If you have an unusual bulge on your throat, tell your doctor about it. This may be a sign of Zenker’s diverticulum., There are a number of tests that your doctor may perform to diagnose esophageal diverticulum. If you have already been diagnosed, your doctor may want to do more tests to discover the underlying condition causing your diverticula and related disorders. These tests include:



Endoscopy: In this procedure, you will be given a topical anesthetic. The doctor will lower a tube down your throat to examine what types of pockets are developing in your esophagus.

Barium Swallow: You will be asked to swallow a chalk-like liquid. Using a special x-ray, the doctor will track the liquid as it travels down your esophagus to see if there are any obstructions.Esophageal manometry: A tube will be lowered down your throat to measure contractions of your esophagus. This will determine if food can pass safely down to your stomach.

24-Hour Esophageal pH Test: A tube will be lowered into your esophagus through your nose. The outer part of the tube will remain attached to your face. After a day, the tube is removed. This can also be used to diagnose a related condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is the cause of esophageal diverticulum in many people., Antacids can help manage some of the symptoms of esophageal diverticulum, especially if your diverticula are caused by GERD. Talk to your doctor about which antacids may be most appropriate for your condition. Make sure you inform your doctor about any other medications you are taking or allergies you have. Some commonly recommended antacids include:Maalox
Mylanta
Rolaids
Tums

, If you are no longer able to swallow without pain, if food is entering your lungs (aspiration), or if a diverticulum ruptures, you may have to undergo surgery. Discuss these options with your doctor. There are many different types of surgery used to treat these problems, based on their severity and your medical condition. Some common procedures include:



Diverticulectomy: Removal of the diverticulum. This is usually performed in conjunction with another treatment or surgery.

Myotomy: Incisions in muscle fiber to relax pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter. Laparoscopic and Cricopharyngeal are the most common types.Endoscopy with CO 2 laser: Removal of the diverticulum with a laser."

Take antihistamines.,
Use topical creams and ointments.,
Prevent skin damage.",How to Treat Health Problems from Mold2," Antihistamines work by reducing your body's allergic reaction to an irritant (in this case, mold). They may or may not be paired with a decongestant to reduce nasal stuffiness. You can purchase antihistamines without a prescription at most pharmacies and drug stores.Antihistamines (including OTC antihistamines) should never be given to anyone under two years of age, as they may cause life-threatening problems in young children.Antihistamines may have negative interactions with certain medications or if used by people who have certain medical conditions.For example, antihistamines can raise your blood pressure, so you may not be able to take them if you have high blood pressure. Antihistamines may also not be advised for people with glaucoma, kidney disease, and urinary problems. Talk to your doctor before taking antihistamines, even if they are OTC medications.
Common side effects include drowsiness and thick secretions from the respiratory system. However, some rare, more serious side effects have been reported in some individuals., Topical medications like creams, lotions, and ointments may help alleviate the symptoms of skin irritation. These medications come in both prescription-strength and over-the-counter formulas.Your doctor may prescribe a steroid cream, an antifungal cream, or some other type of topical treatment.
You can also use over-the-counter cortisone (steroidal) cream to reduce inflammation and irritation.
Treat rashes and itchy, irritated skin at home using over-the-counter moisturizers, such as Benadryl or hydrocortisone cream.
Choose a topical cream, ointment, or lotion that has a low alcohol content and is designed for people with eczema, as these will be more gentle on your skin.
Be aware that some of these creams may contain alcohol, which can irritate your skin. This is especially important to keep in mind if you have a rash, which may become infected or lead to scarring from using a cream that contains alcohol.

, If you have a skin rash or irritation caused by mold, the intense itchiness will cause you to scratch excessively at the affected area. It's important to take some basic steps to reduce the risk of breaking your skin as you scratch, since this could lead to an infection and further irritation.Keep your fingernails trimmed short to avoid scratching your skin too hard.
If you scratch in your sleep, consider wearing light fabric gloves to protect your skin.
Above all, make sure to talk with your doctor or dermatologist. Skin damage from a mold allergy is very serious.

Improve the air quality in your home.,
Close your windows at night.,
Wear protective gear when you clean.,
Avoid exposure to airborne mold spores.,
Locate a professional to get rid of existing mold.,
Prevent mold from growing.",How to Treat Health Problems from Mold3," Even if there aren't any leaks in your home, you may still develop mold problems if the air is very damp. This may be particularly problematic in wet, humid environments. One way to reduce this problem is by improving your home's air quality to produce a cooler, drier environment.Use a dehumidifier to pull moisture out of the air. Try to keep your home's level of humidity between 30 to 50 percent, and be sure to clean out the dehumidifier on a regular basis (every day, if you can).
Use air conditioning in your home, ideally with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. You should also change the filters in your air conditioner and furnace on a regular basis.

, Your home may not have a mold problem, but if you sleep with your windows open you may be exposing yourself to outdoor mold spores. Because the air tends to be cooler and damper at night than during the day, mold spore concentrations are typically highest in the air at night., If you know you will be encountering a mold problem, wear a dust mask that completely covers your nose and mouth and disposable protective gloves. This will help prevent mold spores from entering your airways or irritating your skin.Use protective gear if you intend to clean an existing mold problem, fix a damp/wet environment in your home, or do yard work after a lot of precipitation.
You can purchase protective gear at most home improvement stores or through an online retailer.
Look for an N-95 respirator mask, which will protect your respiratory system from mold exposure.
Kill the mold while wearing protective gear. Your protective gear should include an N-95 respirator, nitrile gloves, and a disposable gown.

, Some people with severe reactions to mold may need to limit their exposure to outdoor air when mold spore concentrations are at their highest. If at all possible, limit outdoor time on those days and try to avoid strenuous activity as much as you can.Most weather reports include a mold count for the day. This can tell you what the expected prevalence of airborne mold spores will be for a given day.
Check your region's mold counts and limit or avoid outdoor activities on days when the mold count is high.

, If your home has any mold, you'll need to act fast before it gets worse. Treating the health problems caused by mold will only reduce your symptoms; the only way to solve the problem permanently is to remove the mold from your home. Your best course of action is to contact a professional who specializes in mold removal.


You can find professionals who work with mold by checking your local phone book or by searching online.
If you or someone you know does not have a known mold allergy, you may be able to clean up a small mold patch on your own. Be sure to wear proper protection: protective eyewear, a breathing mask, and rubber gloves.
You can purchase a commercial cleaning product designed to treat mold, or mix one ounce (29.5 milliliters) of bleach in one quart (0.95 milliliters) of water., When it comes to mold, it's best to take preventative measures and reduce the chances of developing a problem in the first place. You can do this by reducing the moisture levels in your home and cleaning or removing objects that have grown mold.Clean your shower and/or bathtub on a regular basis. Mildew and mold can quickly build on the walls and curtains of your shower if left unattended.
Fix any leaky pipes or water seepage immediately and clean up any standing water or condensation. Dampness, especially in cool, dark areas like a basement, can quickly lead to mold growth.
Get rid of old paper products, particularly newspapers and books. Leaving these items in a damp environment like your basement can cause mold to develop very quickly.
Use a fan to help ventilate your bathroom and prevent mold from growing.

Eat a bland diet.,
Choose soft foods if you have difficulty swallowing.,
Drink more water.,
Rest after a meal.",How to Treat Esophageal Diverticulum2," Esophageal diverticulum is often caused and aggravated by a disease called Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). GERD often causes acid from the stomach to rise into the esophagus, weakening the muscle lining and encouraging diverticula to form. To prevent your esophageal diverticulum from worsening, you can reduce the chance of acid reflux by eating a bland diet. This means that you reduce spicy, fatty, and acidic foods in your diet.Some things you may eat include:


Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and peas
Legumes, including kidney beans, black beans, and tofu products
Lean meats such as chicken, lean ground beef, and fish
Starches, such as brown bread, rice and pasta

, For some people with esophageal diverticulum, swallowing can be painful or difficult. To help maintain a healthy diet, you should look for soft, semi-moist, or liquid foods that will go down easily. You may need to puree, mince, or blend harder foods so that you can swallow them more easily.Some good foods include:


Baked sweet potatoes
Apple sauce
Pudding
Soft white bread
Scrambled eggs
Soup
Cottage cheese

, Water can help reduce acid reflux while helping flush food safely down to your stomach. It may also help prevent food from becoming stuck in the diverticula pockets. Always drink a glass of water after finishing a meal.Avoid drinking too much alcohol and coffee, as these might increase acid reflux, which can in turn worsen esophageal diverticulum. Alcohol may also weaken the mucosal layer of your esophagus, leaving it vulnerable to more diverticula., It is important that your food can pass undisrupted down to your stomach after you eat. To prevent regurgitation, you should rest after every meal sitting with your back and neck straight. You may also stand if that is easier. Avoid strenuous activity, and do not lie down. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to rest."

Stop smoking four weeks before surgery.,
Discuss your medications with your doctor.,
Start a liquid diet.,
Inform your doctor if any complications develop.,
Take medications as directed.,
Maintain a liquid diet while you heal.",How to Treat Esophageal Diverticulum3," If you smoke, it recommended that you quit at least four weeks before your surgery. As quitting smoking may be difficult for some people, you may want to try quitting as soon as your surgery is scheduled.If you quit early enough, you can ease off the cigarettes by using a nicotine gum or patch. You should discontinue use of these between one and four weeks before surgery, as nicotine may interfere with the surgery.
Get rid of all cigarettes in your house, car, and office to reduce the chance that you will start smoking again before the surgery.
To improve your chances of success, join a stop-smoking class for support and tips., It is important that your doctor knows all the medications you are taking before you have the surgery, including supplements and over-the-counter medications. Some medications will need to be discontinued up to a week before surgery as they may interfere with anesthesia, blood clotting, or any medication that may be given to you after surgery.


NSAIDs such as Motrin, Aleve, and Ibuprofen should be stopped up to one week before you have surgery. If you take aspirin for a heart condition, talk to your doctor to determine if you should keep taking it or not. Acetaminophen is acceptable to take.Blood-thinning medications such as Heparin, Pradax, or warfarin (Coumadin) may need to be discontinued until you are healed from your surgery.Herbal medications and supplements can also interfere with surgery. Let your doctor know of all supplements, herbal remedies, and treatments that you use.

, If you are having a laparoscopic myotomy, your doctor may advise you to go on a liquid diet up to three days before your surgery. This means that you can only consume clear soups and broths, juice, jello, Gatorade, and coffee or tea without milk. You may not eat any solid foods.If you are having a Cricopharyngeal Myotomy, you may be able to eat until midnight the day before you have surgery. Always check with your doctor first., Some swelling and pain may be normal around the incision site, but most diverticulectomies and myotomies are non-invasive surgeries. You should heal within a few days. If you experience the following symptoms, seek treatment immediately.A fever higher than 101.3 °F (38.5 °C)
Chills
Difficulty breathing
Yellow pus coming out of the incision site
A bad smell from the incision site
Worsening pain

, You may be placed on pain medications after your surgery. For the first several days while you are on these medications, you should not drive or work. Ask a friend or family member if they can care for you during this time., After the surgery, you may not be able to eat solid foods until the incisions heal. During this time, you may have to go on a liquid diet, or you may have to soften your foods by pureeing or blending them until they are a slurry.Good liquid foods to consume during this time include beef broth, smooth applesauce, juice, popsicles, and Jello.
Do not drink alcohol until you have fully healed.

Use eucalyptus.,
Try anise, thyme, and oregano.,
Use cardamom and cayenne pepper.,
Try peppermint.,
Contemplate fennel seed and horseradish root.,
Be cautious of pleurisy root.",How to Treat Congestion with Herbs1," Eucalyptus is typically available as an oil instead of an herb. However, it is also available in lozenges, cough medicines, rubs, and bath salves. It has a strong scent and decongestant properties that can help with mucus build up. Eucalyptus has been proven safe for pregnant and nursing women as well as children and it has the GRAS status in the US.. However, never use the oil on children under two years old and always follow dosage instructions.Use a small amount, as the oil is very strong. Try putting a few drops into a bowl of hot water for a steam treatment.
Never ingest eucalyptus oil unless specifically told to by your doctor. There are cold and cough medicines that have eucalyptus oil in them, but they have been formulated for ingestion. The oil is very concentrated and can be very dangerous if too much is ingested. Always ask your doctor before taking any dosage of eucalyptus oil orally.;
, There are many different herbs that are helpful for congestion. Anise, thyme, and oregano are herbs that are safe for pregnant and nursing women as well as children in doses normally found in food and teas. They also have the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US.Anise is available as a seed and essential oil. Use 0.5 to 3 grams of the seed or 0.1 to 0.3 mL of the oil. Use the seed in loose leaf tea or the oil in steam treatments.Thyme and oregano are available as a fresh or dried herbs and are safe at any dosage. They can be added to foods and sprinkled into loose leaf tea., There are other herbs that are decongestants and have additional qualities that can help with your congestion issues. Cardamom has antibacterial properties, which can help you fight bacteria or infection involved with your congestion. Cardamom has not been tested in pregnant and nursing women nor in children.Cayenne pepper works as a counterirritant, which means it irritates the mucous membranes with the result of increasing mucus production. Unlike with congestion, the mucus produced tends to be more liquid and easier to drain. Cardamom is available as a spice, as seeds, and as an oil. All can be used in cooking to help with congestion. The dosing depends on taste.Cayenne is available as a raw pepper, which can be eaten raw or cooked. You can also get it at powder, which can be used in recipes and mixed into beverages. There is no dosing information. The amount depends in taste., Peppermint can be used as an herb or an essential oil. Its powerful smell help with decongestion. You can ingest peppermint oil, but only in small doses. It can cause heartburn. It is safe for pregnant and nursing women and children. It also has the GRAS status in the US. For tea, use 1 tsp of dried peppermint leaves in 1 cup of boiling water. Peppermint oil can be used in 1 to 2 mL doses on the skin. Ingest less than 1 mL at a time.
Do not use peppermint or give peppermint products to small children and infants, as it can cause breathing problems in the young., There are some herbs that you should use with caution because they are not safe for all individuals. Fennel seed is safe for children, but has not been tested in pregnant and nursing women. Despite this, it has GRAS status in the US.Horseradish root has not been tested in pregnant and nursing women or children. Horseradish root may also be irritating for some people, so use it with caution.


Despite the caution, horseradish root has been tested and found effective for sinusitis and bronchitis, which are conditions that cause congestion.The common dosage for horseradish is 20 g of fresh root per day while you are suffering from congestion or respiratory issues.This can be added to recipes or in sauces. It also comes in supplement form, with dosing between two and three capsules per day.Fennel seed can be taken as a seed or as an oil. The daily dosage of the seed is 5 to 7 g and of the oil is 0.1 to 0.6 mL., Pleurisy is an older term used to describe inflammatory conditions of the lung. Pleurisy root has been used since ancient times to treat this conditions, but little modern research is available of its effectiveness or side effects. Pleurisy root should not be used by pregnant or nursing women or by children.


There are also some drug interactions with pleurisy root. Do not use pleurisy root with Digoxin (Lanoxin), any estrogens such as oral contraceptives, or diuretics (water pills) including chlorothiazide (Diuril), chlorthalidone (Thalitone), furosemide (Lasix), or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, Hydrodiuril, Microzide)."

Consider lung surgery as a last resort.",How to Treat COPD," The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking — at least 25% of chronic smokers develop symptomatic COPD.Cigarette smoke contains chemicals that damage the bronchial tubes and air sacs of the lungs, which causes them to lose elasticity. As a result, air is trapped in the lungs during exhalation, essentially making breathing very inefficient. The situation can be acerbated by emphysema, which involves inflammation and overproduction of mucus in the lungs and bronchi.


Stopping smoking is the best preventative measure you can take in avoiding COPD, although the addictive qualities of nicotine make it difficult to quit.
It often takes many years without smoking for a former smoker to achieve near-full lung health again (similar to that of a non-smoker); however, there is usually drastic improvement in lung health annually for every successful year after quitting.
Other related irritants that can cause or acerbate COPD include cigar/pipe smoke and secondhand smoke.
Smoking is a factor in 80 to 90% of all COPD-related deaths and is the leading cause of emphysema. Emphysema causes damage to the air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe. People with emphysema often have a blue hue on their lips and fingernail beds, develop a barrel chest, and experience a reduced appetite and weight loss.;
, COPD is also caused by chronic exposure to irritating fumes, chemicals and air pollution, particularly in developing countries. In poorer regions of the world, people are routinely exposed to fumes and smoke from burning fuel for cooking food and heating their homes.The situation is often compounded due to poorly ventilated dwellings that don't allow the irritating fumes/smoke to dissipate.


Try to cook in well-ventilated spaces if you're using fuel (oil, kerosene, gas) or burning wood to prepare food and boil water.
Exposure to chemical fumes, smoke and particulate matter (dust, small fibers) from working in an industrial setting is also a relatively common cause of COPD.
If you work in a plant, factory or garage with such irritants, use appropriate facial protection and breathing devices to reduce your risk of COPD.

, Although it's difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, it can significantly improve the overall strength and endurance of your respiratory muscles.Building up lung strength through cardiovascular exercises helps lung tissue expand and contract better, which makes breathing and exchanging gases (oxygen for carbon dioxide) more efficient. Expect shortness of breath and wheezing initially with exercise, but these common COPD symptoms should fade away as you get more fit.


Start with less intense exercise, such as walking around your neighborhood three times per week, then progress to more intense workouts that increase heart and respiratory rates.
More intense cardiovascular exercise includes walking on an inclined treadmill, stair climbing, hiking, jogging and swimming.
You'll likely be winded at first and have to breath through your mouth, but as you develop better cardiovascular fitness, try to take deeper breathes through your nose (see below).

, The breathing pattern of people with COPD tends to be short and shallow due to loss of elasticity in their lung tissues; however, there are two types of breathing patterns that can help promote deeper inhalation/exhalation and provide more comfort: diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about learning these breathing and relaxation techniques so you can practice them on a daily basis, particularly to combat shortness of breath.


Diaphragmatic breathing involves using your diaphragm and abdominal muscles to push out your stomach with each breath in through your nose, then pushing all the air out through your mouth.You can do diaphragmatic breathing while lying down with your head supported by a pillow. Start with between five to 10 minutes of breathing this way about three to four times daily, then gradually increase.
Pursed-lip breathing helps to strengthen the airways and remove trapped air in the lungs by prolonging exhalation through pursed lips.While sitting up in a chair, inhale slowly through your nose, then purse your lips (like you're going to whistle) and exhale slowly through your mouth while counting to four. Practice this technique throughout the day.

, In addition to shortness of breath and wheezing, overproduction of mucus is also common with COPD caused by chronic bronchitis.Mucus is produced by goblet cells in the mucus membranes of the bronchi and other lung tissues in response to chemicals and irritants — your body tries to trap and get rid of them; however, the excess mucus collects in your bronchial tubes and contributes to breathing problems. Mucus can be difficult to clear, but clearing your throat, using a humidifier and drinking lots of water can help get rid of it.


Having to clear your airways first in the morning is common with COPD, because the mucus collects while you're laying in bed. Propping yourself up with pillows in your bed may help.
Productive coughing with COPD often brings up mucus (sputum) that's yellow or greenish.
When you have chronic bronchitis, the lining of the bronchial tubes in your lungs becomes swollen. This, along with the increase of mucus, can make it difficult to breathe and lead to a ""phlegmy"" cough.Other symptoms of COPD due to chronic bronchitis include chest tightness, wheezing, fatigue, frequent respiratory infections, and shortness of breath (especially when exercising)., Get lung testing done through spirometry testing. These test can provide a great deal of information about lung health and which medications would be most helpful in treating your COPD.


Spirometry tests how much air you can inhale and exhale and how quickly you can perform these function.In addition, your doctor may wish to perform an x-ray or CT scan, A1AT deficiency tests, and a blood test to measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.

, Medications called bronchodilators relax the muscles lining your airways and are usually administered in inhalers.It's a common treatment for asthma, but helpful also for COPD for opening up the airways and making breathing easier. Inhalers are small plastic devices that are positioned over your mouth and shoot the vaporized medication directly into your lungs.


Depending on the severity of the COPD, you may need either a short-acting bronchodilator drug before activities, a long-acting one that you use daily, or both.
Short-acting bronchodilator medications include: albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol (Xopenex) and ipratropium (Atrovent).
Long-acting bronchodilator medications include: tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza)., Inhaled corticosteroid drugs can quickly reduce airway inflammation and help combat shortness of breath and wheezing associated with COPD.Corticosteroids can be inhaled like bronchodilator medications or taken orally as pills. Examples of inhaled steroids include fluticasone (Flovent) and budesonide (Pulmicort). Methylprednisolone is an oral steroid. Steroids are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD symptoms.


Some bronchodilators can also be combined with inhaled steroids in the same inhaler. Examples of combo inhalers include salmeterol with fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol with budesonide (Symbicort).
Corticosteroids can cause significant side effects if used frequently. Common issues include oral oral infections, hoarseness, reduced immune response, weight gain and tissue bruising (or other changes).

, Your doctor may refer you to a pulmonary rehabilitation program, which will use a combination of exercise and education to help you improve your health and teach you how to manage your COPD once the program has ended.A pulmonary rehabilitation program may teach you about the following: breathing techniques, medications, nutrition, relaxation, oxygen, travel, accomplishing daily tasks, and avoiding things that make your COPD worse.
In addition, you may recieve counseling and assistance in coping with disorders that often occur as a result of living with COPD, such as depression, panic, and anxiety. You will also meet others with COPD, which can provide a sense of community and support.

, Though rare, emphysema is sometimes caused by the heredity disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency.A1AT is a protein that protects the lungs, and those with this disorder do not produce enough A1AT to prevent damage. If you have COPD due to this deficiency, you can receive intravenous augmentation therapy to elevate your A1AT levels., If there isn't enough oxygen being absorbed in your lungs and into your bloodstream, your doctor may recommend using supplemental oxygen.There are many lightweight and portable units that contain an oxygen bottle and mouth/nose piece for breathing. Some may need oxygen only during activity, others for sleeping and still others full time.


Oxygen therapy improves the quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend lifespan.Patients cannot get oxygen unless they go through formal testing and meet certain criteria. Too much oxygen in COPD patients can be dangerous.
Oxygen therapy can protect the heart and other organs from damage due to cyanosis.
Oxygen therapy can be administered as a long-term continuous therapy or just for short-term periods of time. Consult your doctor about how many supplemental litres of oxygen you need per day.

, Lung surgery is a last resort for people who have severe and advanced COPD symptoms who have not significantly improved by taking the above-mentioned medicines.Surgery can be very beneficial, especially for those with emphysema. Surgeries for people with emphysema-related COPD include a bullectomy and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). In the most severe cases of COPD, entire lung transplants are performed.


When the air sacs of the lung are destroyed, large air spaces called bullae form. A bullectomy involves removing the bullae so breathing is made easier.
With LVRS, damaged and diseased lung tissue is removed from the upper lungs, which creates extra space in the chest cavity for the remaining healthy tissue to expand and work more efficiently.
A lung transplant is an option for people who have very severe COPD and are older than 65 who don't have heart, liver or kidney disease. The damaged lung is completely removed and replaced with one from a deceased donor.

Notice differences in cost.,
Observe differences in concentration.,
Recognize differences in packaging.,
Recognize popular essential oils and infused oils.,
Use essential oils and infused oils in combination.",How to Tell the Difference Between Essential Oil and Infused Oil1," Infused oils tend to be a lot cheaper than essential oils because they don't require the same extraction processes. (They don't require a hard-to-extract oil to make up the bulk of the product.) If the oil you are buying seems very cheap, it is probably infused rather than essential oil.


Essential oils will typically cost $8-15 for 0.5 ounces (15 ml).
Infused oils will typically cost $4-15 per ounce (30 ml).;
, Essential oils are highly concentrated, while infused oils are much more mild. Essential oils are so powerful that they should almost never be applied directly to the skin, but rather diluted in a carrier oil. Infused oils, on the other hand, are gentle enough to be used on bare skin., Essential oils must always be packaged in dark glass bottles, as they can be easily damaged by bright sunlight. Infused oils are not damaged in the same way, and as such, may be packaged in either dark or light containers.Essential oils are generally packaged in 0.5 ounce (15 ml) dark glass bottles. (An extremely popular oil, such as lavender oil will sometimes be available in 1 ounce bottles).
Infused oils are generally packaged in 1 ounce (30 ml) bottle or larger. These bottles may be either dark or clear glass.

, If you are familiar with popular types of both essential and infused oils, you more easily be able to identify each. Be aware that some plants can be used to create either type of oil.


Popular essential oils include: lavender, oregano, patchouli, peppermint, and lemon.
Popular infused oils include: calendula, st. johns wort, mullein, and comfrey.

, You may choose to use essential oils and infused oils in combination. If you want to create a massage oil for example, you may begin with lavender infused in jojoba oil (for stress relief). Later you may choose to add a few drops of tea tree oil (for antiseptic purposes), citrus (for boosting mood), or oregano (for immune function). In this way, the already infused oil serves as your carrier oil, carrying with it many additional health benefits."

Understand how steam helps.,
Use the right herbs for steam treatments.,
Prepare herbal steam treatments.,
Use the herbal steam treatment.",How to Treat Congestion with Herbs2," Most decongestant herbs are best taken as steam treatments, breathing the herbs in, directly into the nose, the lungs, and the sinuses. Steam can help open up the nasal passages, help thin out the sometimes thick mucus, and allow the mucus to drain out of the sinuses. These treatments can be used along with pain relievers, antibiotics, and antifungal treatments as well as for viral infections of the sinuses.


If you are already seeing a physician, continue with those treatments along with steam treatments.If you are not seeing a physician and these treatments don’t give you any relief within five to seven days, make an appointment to see a physician. You may be dealing with a more complicated situation.

, You can use dried herbs or the essential oils when you use the steam method for your decongestion. Essential oils tend to be a bit more effective because they are the concentrated forms of the herbs.


You can also try a mixture of a couple different herbs or oils, such as eucalyptus and peppermint.
These essential oils have either antibacterial, antifungal, or antiseptic properties. This means they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect the sinuses as well as help break up congestion.
Be aware that allergic reactions are always possible with herbs. The first time you try an herb, do so for only three to five minutes for steam treatments and and then wait for 30 minutes to determine if you are experiencing any adverse reactions. If you do, choose another herb., Fill a one quart pot with water. Place the pan on the stove and let it boil. Remove from heat, then add either one to two drop of the essential oils or 1/2 a teaspoon of dried herbs for one quart of water. Sit the pot aside and cover. Let the oil or herb steep in the hot water for five minutes.If you don't have a quart pot, a kettle or other pot that can hold at least a quart of water will work fine.

Never place your head over boiling water. This can cause burns or serious injury.
Cayenne pepper is the exception to the recipe for teas and steam decongesting. Use ⅛ to ¼ a teaspoon. This herb is very strong and is too overpowering in larger doses., Open the lid of the pot. Place your hand over the pot to test the temperature. It should be hot but not painful. If it is a good temperature, cover your head with a large, clean cotton towel, close your eyes, and place your head over the steaming pot that is away from the stove. Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water. You want the heat to enter your nose and throat, but you certainly don’t want to damage or burn yourself with heat.Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts and then in and out through your mouth for two counts.
Repeat for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose during and after the treatments.
You can do this every two hours or as often as your schedule permits."

Study the properties of various essential oils.,
Diffuse essential oils.,
Use essential oils topically.,
Consume essential oils.",How to Tell the Difference Between Essential Oil and Infused Oil2," Essential oils are aromatic compounds housed within plants. Essential oils may be located in bark, seeds, flowers, stems, roots, and other parts of plants. These oils are extracted using a variety of methods and can be used for medicinal, beauty, or culinary purposes.Common essential oils include tea tree oil, lavender, peppermint, patchouli, and lemon.

, Essential oils are very useful for a wide variety of health, beauty, and mood-boosting applications. In order to understand essential oils, it is important to get a sense of some uses of different essential oils.Essential lavender oil has excellent calming properties.
Essential geranium oil is a good oil for balancing emotions.
Essential rosemary oil is great for inhaling when you have a cough or cold.
Essential lemon or grapefruit oils are ideal as air fresheners, leaving a fresh aroma in a room.

, The most popular way to utilize essential oils is called “diffusing.” This is when you use an appliance called an “essential oil diffuser” to release the essence of various essential oils into the air. Similar to a humidifier, the diffuser heats up the oil and turns it into vapor. This creates a wonderful scent and depending on your choice of oil, can have additional health benefits.Diffusers run from $20-100 and can be purchased online or at most health food stores.
You can also heat water on your stove with a few drops of essential oil to achieve a similar effect.

, Another prominent use of essential oils involves topical application. This is when you apply 1-2 drops of oil to an area of your body for medicinal purposes, or as perfume. As essential oils are highly concentrated and very strong, it is recommended that you use a “carrier oil,” like coconut oil or avocado oil. Mix one drop of essential oil with three drops of carrier oil and apply to your skin.Try applying essential oils to your neck, the bottoms of your feet, or the backs of your wrists.
Patchouli, lavender, and cedarwood oils are commonly used topically as a perfume.

, Essential oils can have medicinal benefits when taken orally. You can use very small amounts of essential oils to replace herbs and spices in cooking, take essential oils as supplements in a veggie capsule (or added to applesauce), or add small drops to smoothies, tea, or other drinks.Peppermint oil can be used to give smoothies or baked good a minty taste, while also being extremely soothing to your tummy.
Oregano oil can be used in place of dried oregano, while simultaneously boosting your immune function.

Create infused oils for cooking.",How to Tell the Difference Between Essential Oil and Infused Oil3," An infused oil (also known as a macerated oil) is a basic vegetable oil (such as, sweet almond oil, olive oil, grape seed oil) that has been infused with the flavor of a different plant. This is usually done by steeping leaves, flowers, stems, roots, or other parts of a plant, either with heat or for a long period of time.Common infused oils include arnica, comfrey, mullein, and St. Johns Wort.

, The most popular types of infused oils include Calendula oil (made from marigold flowers) and St. Johns Wort. Calendula is known for its soothing properties and is used in a variety of beauty products. St. Johns Wort infused oil can be used to treat an array of ailments, including sunburn, nerve pain, varicose veins, and hemorrhoids.Oil infusions are often made from a mix of herbs and flowers.

, One benefit of infused oils is that, unlike essential oils, they can be created at home. Doing so is easy. All you need is a “carrier oil” (olive oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil are all good choices), dried herbs, spices, or flowers, and a clean, transparent, airtight container (ideally glass). Simply chop your plant matter as finely as possible. Then place your carrier oil and plant mater in your airtight jar, and place the jar in a sunny location for 2-3 weeks.Adding a few drops of either Vitamin E oil or Wheat Germ oil to your infusion can help prevent any bacteria from growing in your oil.
You can speed up the process by infusing your oil in a slow cooker on low heat overnight.

, Hydrosols are not technically “oil infusions,” but hydrosols, essential oils, and infused oils are often grouped together, and all can be used for aromatherapy. Hydrosols are substances like rose water or lavender water. They are created as a byproduct of distillation. These fragrances can be used as perfumes, as air fresheners, in cooking (as with orange essence), or in cosmetics., One popular way to use infused oils is for cooking. These oils can be purchased at specialty grocery stores or created at home. Using olive, grapeseed, or avocado oil as your base, you can add a variety of herbs, spices, citrus, and/or nuts to create any flavor you desire. Infused cooking oils also make excellent gifts.Select your flavoring (whole or ground spices are fine). You will need approximately 2 Tbs. of flavorings for every 1 cup of oil.
Heat your oil and flavorings in a saucepan over medium heat for about 5 minutes (until the liquid is bubbling).
Remove from heat and allow to cool.
Strain your oil using cheesecloth or a fine sieve.
Bottle your oil in a glass, airtight container.
Store your infused oil in the refrigerator for up to one month.

Take care if you use it in conjunction with prescribed anti-depressants.,
See a naturopath physician.,
Seek medical care to treat your depression.",How to Use St John's Wort1," Depression is the primary reason people use St. John's wort. Research the value of using St. John's wort as an anti-depressant to decide if this is a treatment option for you. There is some scientific evidence that St. John's wort is useful for treating mild to moderate depression, but it is not effective for severe depression.If you have other mental health disorders (e.g. bipolar disorder) in addition to depression, taking St. John's wort can cause psychosis (i.e. hallucinations, confused thinking, false beliefs and delusions)., Take 300 mg, three times a day with a meal. Check the label of your capsule or tablet. It should be standardized to contain 0.3% hyperycin extract. Hyperycin is the active ingredient in St. John's wort that works as an antidepressant. It will take three to six weeks before you feel any effect. If you decide to stop taking St. John's wort, gradually wean yourself off. You may experience some side effects if you stop the treatment overnight., It is important that you know exactly how much St. John's wort you are getting. Taking the herb in a capsule or table form will guarantee that you are getting the recommended dosage. Ingesting St. John's wort as a tea or eating the flowers of the plant should not be done to treat depression. There is no way to know how much St. John's wort you are actually getting using those methods.

, If you take St. John's Wort in conjunction with other anti-depressants, your serotonin (i.e. brain chemical that anti-depressants target) levels may rise to an unsafe level. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include tremor, diarrhea, muscle stiffness, decrease in body temperature, death, and extreme confusion. It can also decrease the effectiveness of your prescribed medication., A naturopath physician is trained in the use of natural medicines for improving health and wellness. These doctors likely have experience treating depression with St. John's wort. Visit the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians website to find a licensed doctor.Also consider visiting an herbalist to help you with your depression. An herbalist is trained to stimulate your body's healing power through the use of herbs, diet, and lifestyle. You can find an herbalist by visiting the American Herbalists Guild website., Let your doctor know that you are interested in using St. John's wort as part of your treatment.Untreated depression can become severe and lead to suicide. Even if St. John's wort is not a good option for you, there are effective medications and treatments that can help you.

Use cough drops.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Take a warm shower.,
Gargle salt water.",How to Stop Coughing Without Cough Syrup1," Cough drops have cough-suppressing ingredients. They are also a great way to keep your throat moist, which helps suppress a cough even further. Cough drops are not medicinal but simply help to activate your salivary glands, which brings extra moisture to the back of your throat. Cough drops are best used for dry coughs, rather than wet.


Buy cough drops that include ingredients like honey, lemon, eucalyptus, and mint to help ease your coughing symptoms.;
, A warm towel applied to the neck or chest may help relieve congestion in the lungs and nasal passages. This is due to the increase in stimulation, which encourages mucus drainage that can otherwise cause irritation in the throat. To use this method, soak a small, clean towel in lukewarm water for three to five minutes. Wring the water out and apply it to your chest or neck for five minutes. Rewet the towel again in warm water, then repeat the additional steps for up to 20 minutes.


Do not apply heat for longer than 20 minutes unless recommended by your doctor or physician.
If you don't want to use a towel, you can use a hot gel pack or water bottle to apply heat compression. Make sure it isn't hot enough to burn the skin — some kind of barrier, like cloth between the heat source and your skin.
Do not apply heat if there is swelling or fever. Use an ice bag instead. People with poor circulation and diabetes should practice caution when using warm compression., When suffering from a bad cough, a warm shower or bath that lasts for five to 10 minutes can reduce it by soothing your throat, encouraging mucus drainage, and relaxing your sore muscles. It can help loosen up bronchial passages with increased humidity and moisture allowing for more productive cough. Make sure the water is not too hot or cold, especially if you have a fever. Keeping your body clean can also help reduce the risk of further viral or bacterial infections.


Lukewarm baths can also benefit children and infants with nasal congestion and sore throats., When you are suffering from a cough due to a sore throat, gargle warm salt water. This helps soothe a sore throat and moisturizes your sinuses, which allows mucus to drain and prevents postnasal drip that can trigger coughs. Place 1/2 a teaspoon of salt in a glass of distilled or sterilized warm water and stir until it's dissolved. Gargle the water for one to two minutes, then spit it out. Do not swallow it.


If the salt irritates your mouth or throat, you can also use plain, distilled warm water for gargles.
Repeat every few hours."

If a recommended dose is given, follow the instructions, unless your doctor recommends a different dose. All products are different, so they may contain different concentrations of the herb.;
, The easiest way to take valerian root is to purchase pills or capsules at your local drug store. The recommended dose is between 400 and 900 mg of valerian root.Taking valerian root in pill form will help you avoid the unpleasant taste associated with many of its other forms.
Some pills contain only valerian root, while others contain other herbs as well.

, If you purchase dried valerian root, you can use it to steep your own herbal tea. Simply place one teaspoon of the valerian root (approximately 2-3 grams) in a mug and add hot water. Allow the tea to steep for at least five minutes before drinking.You may be able to purchase either powdered valerian root extract or a whole piece of dried root for use in your tea. You may also be able to find pre-made teabags.

, You can purchase two different kinds of liquid valerian root: a tincture, which is less concentrated, or a liquid extract, which is more concentrated. You can add either to water.If you use a tincture, add between 1 and 1-1/2 teaspoon of valerian root to your water. If you use a liquid extract, add between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon.
If you find the taste too unpleasant, you can try adding some honey or sugar to the mixture., No matter what form you take valerian root in, take it one to two hours before bedtime for the best results. It may take several weeks for you to understand exactly how long it will take valerian root to start having an effect, so adjust accordingly.Valerian root can also be taken during the day to help ease anxiety and stomach problems, but it does cause drowsiness, so be very careful with your dosage if you choose to do this.

, You may not get any benefit the first several times you take valerian root. In fact, it is often not effective until it has been taken regularly for several weeks. If you want to give it a fair chance, continue taking valerian root daily for at least two to three weeks., Valerian root is often taken alone, but it is also commonly mixed with other herbs that are thought to help sleep. Lemon balm and hops are two of the most popular herbs used in conjunction with valerian root.Try taking 120 mg of valerian root along with 80 mg of lemon balm. Alternatively, you can try taking a combination pill that contains 180 mg of valerian root along with 41.9 mg of hops.
Always talk to your doctor before taking multiple herbal supplements together, as they may interact with each other.

, While valerian root is a fairly safe herbal supplement, there are some side effects that you may experience while taking it. These include dizziness, headaches, and stomach problems.In addition, you may feel very drowsy, even after a full night’s sleep, so it is important to use extreme caution when driving or operating machinery.

, Valerian root is not right for everyone. Before you take it, talk to your doctor to ensure that it is safe for you.Women who are pregnant or nursing should not take valerian root.
Children under 3 years old should not take valerian root.
People with liver disease should not take valerian root.

, Valerian root may interact with prescription medications and other herbal supplements you are taking. Always talk to your doctor about all of the medications and supplements you take.Valerian root is known to interact with alcohol and sedatives.
Valerian root may also affect your liver function, so be cautious if you are taking medications that are broken down by the liver.

, If you suffer from insomnia, taking valerian root may not be the best remedy for your condition. Seeing a doctor for a diagnosis can help you discover and treat the root cause of your insomnia.Cognitive behavioral therapy is a very effective treatment for insomnia that is not caused by an underlying medical condition.

Use a humidifier.,
Get an indoor houseplant.,
Try an air purifier.,
Sleep on your side.,
Prop your head on a pillow.,
Drink lots of water.,
Avoid intense exercise.,
Quit smoking.",How to Stop Coughing Without Cough Syrup3," Dry air can aggravate the symptoms of a cold, making it harder for mucus to drain and triggering coughs. Using a humidifier in your bedroom or living room adds moisture to the air to help clear your sinuses and soothe your throat. With your humidifier, try to aim for the right humidity. The air should range from 30% to 55% humidity.


If the humidity is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive, both of which are common causes of allergies and coughs.
If the humidity falls too low, it may cause dry eyes, throat and sinus irritations. The simplest way to measure humidity is with a gauge called a humidistat, which can be purchased from most hardware stores.
Both portable and central humidifiers must be cleaned often and thoroughly because they tend to become contaminated with mold and bacterial growth., If you don't want an electric humidifier, consider getting a houseplant. Plants can help regulate indoor humidity due to a process called transpiration, which is where water vapor is released from the flowers, leaves, and stems. Good indoor plants include bamboo palms, aloe vera, Chinese evergreens, various species of philodendron and dracaena, and weeping figs.


Indoor plants also help clear the air of carbon dioxide and pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene, which may otherwise irritate your throat.Make sure you are not allergic to any plants you might bring into your home.

, In addition to humidifiers, air purifiers help clear the air of allergens that cause coughs. It has the added bonus of keeping your house smelling nice and clean. An electronic cleaner is especially good at sweeping mold and pollen particles from the air by catching them on an electrically charged plate.


Another type of cleaner, known as an ionizer, makes electrically charged ions that bond to particles in the air and causes them to cling to walls, ceilings, and drapes., Sleeping can be hard when you have a chronic cough. Getting enough sleep is important in order for your body to heal itself so you can get rid of your cough. Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease, and lower life expectancy.


If you have a persistent cough, try to lie on the side that is least congested to breathe comfortably and allow the mucus to drain., If you have trouble breathing while you sleep due to cough, try to prop your head up on a pillow to improve airflow and keep mucus from blocking the sinuses and throat. The pillow for your head should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable while also helping you breath better.


A pillow that's too high can put your neck into a position that causes throat blockage and cough, as well as muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders., Water helps ease cough inducing behavior such as congestion caused by colds, postnasal drip that can irritate the throat, and dry throats. It moistens throat and thins mucus, allowing for easier clearing of problematic phlegm. Aim to drink at least 8 ounces of water every two hours. 2 liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. If you take caffeinated beverages, drink 1 liter of water for every cup of caffeine.


Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration. Dehydration can cause headaches, irritability, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help alleviate dehydration as well., Try to avoid intensive training if you have a cough, cold, fever, or headache. If intensive exercise is triggering your cough, along with symptoms such as wheezing, chest pain, and shortness of breath, you may have exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). This happens when the tubes that bring air into and out of your lungs narrow with exercise, causing symptoms of asthma. Some people with EIB do not otherwise have asthma, and people with allergies may also have trouble breathing during exercise.


Talk to your physician or an immunologist to help develop a personalized fitness plan for your condition. Avoid cold, dry temperatures and changes in atmospheric pressure as these can trigger EIB. , Smoking deprives the body of the necessary oxygen required to repair and build cells. This happens because of a narrowing of your blood vessels that carry blood to the leg and arm muscles and the brain. This can lead to many respiratory illnesses, chronic coughing, and even stroke. Smoking is one of the leading causes of chronic coughing and bronchitis, also known as smoker’s cough.


Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other hazardous fumes if you have a cough or sore throat. Avoid smoking especially when you have a headache or fever, as smoking can weaken the immune system and prolong the condition. Ask your doctor about ways to reduce and quit smoking."

Children and infants should be given a bland soup, as this reduces the risk of nausea and vomiting. , Pineapples are rich in an enzyme called bromelain which is used in medicine for reducing swelling and inflammation of the air passages, in order to prevent mucus buildup which can lead to congestion and coughing. Eating pineapples can also help prevent respiratory infections that often trigger coughs. Incorporate more fresh pineapple and pineapple juice into your daily diet to get more of bromelain's helpful properties.


Do not eat potatoes or soy products with your pineapple. These foods contain substances that may slow down bromelain’s healing properties in the body., Certain foods can slow down the body’s healing process, impair the immune system, and increase inflammation. They may also cause gastroesophageal acid reflux, which can increase the severity of coughs.


Lessen or avoid foods that can cause chronic inflammation, such as fried foods, veal, ham, steak, hot dogs, margarine, shortening, lard, refined carbohydrates, white bread, pasta, donuts, soda, and energy drinks. , While some foods can cause inflammation, certain foods can also help reduce inflammation to help ease a sore throat. Eat more fruit, such as strawberries, cherries, and oranges. You should also eat more hearty foods, such as almonds, walnuts, salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, and olive oil. Consuming whole grains such as millet, oatmeal, brown rice, flaxseed, and quinoa will also help reduce inflammation.


Also try more vegetables such as olives, spinach, kale, and broccoli.
Fruits with citric acid may cause acid reflux, aggravating your throat and triggering coughs., Cayenne peppers contain capsaicin, which has antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties to promote healing.

Keep hand sanitizer with you to help disinfect your hands when you are out in public or at work. Remind your child not to put her fingers in her mouth or eyes, as germs are often spread this way., Use a tissue when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs through the air. This will also help you avoid letting other bacteria or viruses into your lungs when you inhale. If you don’t have a tissue on hand, sneeze or cough into your elbow rather than cupping your hands over your face.


This helps you avoid spreading germs to your hands and them onto other objects as well., Allergens irritate your sinuses, which causes congestion that can lead to difficulty breathing, trigger postnasal drip, and aggravate the throat. Allergies happen when your immune system produces antibodies to fight free radicals by releasing chemical such as histamine, which can cause inflammation and allergy symptoms. Flower pollen, dust, and mold are some of the most common allergens.


Other common allergens include hazardous fumes, cigarette and secondhand smoke, shellfish, shrimp, fish, eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, soy, pet allergies caused by shedding from common pets, insect stings, certain medications, certain substances you wear or touch, and chemicals and dyes in fabrics"

Babies are prone to respiratory difficulties as they are ""obligatory nose breathers."" If the baby's nose becomes congested, he will have problems breathing.
See your doctor immediately if your baby has a temperature higher than 100.4°F (38°C), has red eyes or eye discharge, has trouble breathing, is bluish around the lips and mouth, coughs up blood, coughs hard enough to cause vomiting, and/or refuses to nurse or accept fluids, which can cause dehydration."

Diffuse essential oils.",How to Treat a Headache with Herbs2," Herbs such as kava-kava, valerian, passionflower can act as relaxing agents, relieving the tension of tension headaches within hours.Chamomile, mint or rosemary, while not proven to help headaches, can help you relax and feel less anxious.


Note that rosemary can raise the blood pressure in some individuals.

, Kava-kava has pain-relieving properties, reduces anxiety and improves sleep.It is important to choose an extract done with water and not alcohol. This may reduce the potential of liver damage, which is a risk of kava-kava. Follow the manufacturer’s directions, but in general, take about 75 mg of kava-kava.The main side effect reported with kava is drowsiness.


People diagnosed with kidney disease, Parkinson’s disease, liver disease, blood diseases or taking alprazolam or levodopa should not use kava-kava.

, This remedy has been used for centuries and works by increasing the calming neurotransmitters in your brain.In general, take 150-300mg of valerian.Valerian should not be taken if you are allergic to it or have been diagnosed with liver problems. Side effects such as upset stomach, headaches and drowsiness have been reported.


Valerian should not be taken with many other medications, so check with a knowledgeable healthcare professional first if you are taking any other medications.

, Passionflower has not been very extensively studied, but has a long history of use. It also appears to increase increase calming neurotransmitters in the brain.This can reduce tension and anxiety and may directly reduce pain.In general, take 100-150mg of passionflower.Passionflower has no known side effects, drug interactions or contraindications.

, You can use tea leaves, or purchase a tincture, which is an extract of these herbs, from a nutritional or health food store. Drink 1 or 2 cups at the first sign of a headache.


You can add about 150mg of hops as well. Hops is known in botanical medicine as a tonic and sedative, working to strengthen your whole system and helping you relax., If you have a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner near you, ask for Hepataplex (long dan xie gan tang containing beets, milk thistle, parsley, dandelion, boldo, greater celandine and other minor ingredients). This is a traditional combination of Chinese herbs that has been shown to be very effective in relieving tension headaches by reducing inflammation and strengthening the liver and kidneys which are important for overall health. Take 2 pills three times a day as needed (with or without meals)., Place essential oils such as chamomile, mint, rosemary, lemon balm, or lavender into a diffuser at the first sign of a headache. These can help you relax and feel less anxious. Note that lemon balm should not be used by anyone with thyroid problems.

This may dilate the constricted blood vessels that may be underlying migraine pain.Feverfew is well-known for treating the pain of migraines, and reducing their frequency.


If you are allergic or have any sensitivities to any plant in the aster family, you should not use feverfew. Feverfew should not be used if you have a bleeding disorder or before surgery unless under the advice of a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner.

, This is one of the best studied herbs and shown to be effective at treating migraines.It works much the same way as feverfew, by reducing inflammation. Butterbur should not be used if you have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure.

, These are often recommended by naturopathic physicians. Willow bark acts like a sort of natural aspirin, without the side effects.Skullcap appears to increase local levels of oxygen in the bloodand ginkgo functions as an anti-oxidant and protects brain cells., Place essential oils such as chamomile, mint, rosemary, lemon balm, or lavender into a diffuser at the first sign of a headache.

Choose an appropriate type of Valerian.,
Start with a moderate dosage.,
Take regularly for several weeks.,
Take valerian root right before bed.",How to Treat Stress and Mild Anxiety with Valerian Root Herb1," The most common form is valerian officinalis, and it is best to stick with this form, as it has been studied far more than the other types. It is mostly safe unless you are allergic to valerian or are taking a drug that interacts with valerian., For capsules, this is around 400 to 900 milligrams. You can also take in tea form (2 to 3 grams) or as a tincture in warm water (20 to 60 drops). If you don’t notice an effect immediately, don’t increase the dosage, as the amount is likely not the problem.You can also take it as a tea, using a teaspoon of dried valerian root in a cup of boiling water., It can take awhile for valerian to take effect, so waiting it out is the best method as long as you’re not having any adverse reactions. It can take several weeks for valerian to have a positive effect on anxiety., As it is a sedative, it is best to take it in the evening, so it doesn't affect your day too much, especially if you need to drive early in the day. Taking it 30 minutes to two hours before bed is good as it gives the root time to work as a sleep aid, as well as decreasing anxiety."
"
Watch for signs of an allergic reaction.,
Don’t drive or operate heavy machinery after taking valerian root.,
Watch for signs of increased anxiety.",How to Treat Stress and Mild Anxiety with Valerian Root Herb2," If you develop a rash or have trouble breathing while taking valerian, you should stop immediately. You should also consult a doctor. An allergic reaction can be very serious, so don’t take any chances., As valerian is a sedative it can affect your ability to handle heavy machinery, and can make you very drowsy. It is best to take it right before bed, as it is considered a sleep aid as well., Unfortunately, for some people, valerian root can actually increase anxiety. Some of the potential side effects include increased excitability and uneasiness. There’s not enough evidence out there to say that it definitively helps reduce anxiety, but it does seem to help some people."
"
Stop taking valerian if it has no or negative effects after several weeks.,
Talk to a mental health professional if your anxiety is severely impacting your daily ability to function.,
Talk to a doctor about valerian and alternatives.",How to Treat Stress and Mild Anxiety with Valerian Root Herb3," Of course, if it has immediate negative effects, stop taking it immediately. If you don’t notice any change for several weeks, it might be time to move on to other methods of reducing anxiety., Even if you are experiencing some relief from valerian, if your anxiety is high enough that it affects your ability to function, therapy may be able to help. You may even need medication such as an SSRI to help your anxiety. At any rate, a mental health professional will be able to help you make that assessment.If you are unsure whether you need a mental health professional, it’s always a good idea to go and talk it over with that mental health professional. They’ll be able to assess whether you would benefit from additional therapy.

, You may need to see a doctor in order to know what you need for your stress and anxiety. A doctor may have some additional natural recommendations and can also prescribe anti-anxiety medication, if necessary."

Recognize the signs and symptoms of a potential pulmonary embolism.If you notice these signs and symptoms, it is important to go to the Emergency Room immediately.,
Seek treatment if you have signs of an already-present DVT (deep venous thrombosis).A DVT (deep vein thrombosis), that normally occurs in one of your legs, is often the precursor to developing a PE (pulmonary embolism).,
Consider your risk factors.,
Get blood tests.If you are presenting with signs and symptoms that may be indicative of a pulmonary embolism, one of the first things the doctor will do when you arrive in the Emergency Room is order a series of blood tests.,
Have an electrocardiogram, or ongoing cardiac monitoring.,
Receive a CT angio scan.A CT angio scan is one of the most effective ways to identify and diagnose a pulmonary embolism.,
Opt for a V/Q (ventilation-perfusion) scan.Another diagnostic test that can be used to identify a pulmonary embolism is the V/Q - ventilation-perfusion - scan.,
Ask your doctor for a pulmonary angiography.If a CT angio scan and/or V/Q scan are insufficient to diagnose (or rule out) a pulmonary embolism, your doctor may recommend a more invasive diagnostic test called pulmonary angiography.,
Take an anticoagulant (blood thinning) medication.The mainstay of treatment for a pulmonary embolism are anticoagulant (commonly known as ""blood thinning"") medications.,
Opt for thrombolytic therapy.If the clot (pulmonary embolism) is large enough to cause severe symptoms (such as extreme shortness of breath, chest pain, or even symptoms of shock), your doctor will likely recommend ""thrombolytic therapy."",
Have a clot filter inserted to prevent future emboli (clots).If you have ""contraindications"" (reasons against) being on blood thinning medications, your doctor may advise a clot filter to prevent the formation of future clots.,
Ask about catheter-directed thrombolysis.,
Receive a surgical embolectomy.If the clot is particularly large and severe, a surgical embolectomy may be recommended as a ""last resort treatment."",
Determine the underlying cause.After diagnosing you with a PE, your doctor will want to determine what caused it in the first place, to avoid the future formation of blood clots.",How to Diagnose Pulmonary Embolism," Seeing a doctor for prompt diagnosis and treatment is key. (It is also important to understand, however, that half of people with a pulmonary embolism present with no symptoms.) Symptoms to look out for include:


Shortness of breath and/or rapid respiratory rate
Sudden onset chest pain (often a sharp, localized chest pain that gets worse when you take a breath)
A fast heart rate
Coughing and/or ""hemoptysis"" (coughing up blood);
, It is for this reason that, if you notice signs and symptoms of a DVT (a blood clot in your leg), it is also key that you seek medical treatment immediately. The therapy for both DVT and PE are not identical, but they are similar, so if you seek treatment for your DVT it will both treat the problem and also prevent a future PE from developing. Signs and symptoms of a DVT include:


Leg pain over the calf or lower thigh, often on one side, but it is possible to have DVTs in both legs
Swelling over the affected area, sometimes accompanied with a feeling of tightness on the leg
Skin redness or changes in skin color over the affected area
Warmth over the skin over the affected area

, Certain risk factors may increase your likelihood of developing a pulmonary embolism.In addition to recognizing signs and symptoms, there are risk factors that make you more susceptible to developing a pulmonary embolism. These include:


Being pregnant
Having kidney problems
Being overweight or obese
Having cancer
Being immobilized (either from surgery, disability, or other conditions leading to bedrest)
Having heart failure
Smoking
Having a previous history of blood clots
Taking certain medications (such as birth control pills and/or other hormone replacement therapy, erythropoietin, thalidomide, and tamoxifen)

, There is a blood test test called a ""D-dimer,"" which can be used to rule out a pulmonary embolism, but not to rule it in. What this means is that, if your D-dimer is negative, you can rest assured that you do not, in fact, have a pulmonary embolism. If it is positive, however, it is suspicious (but not diagnostic) of a possible pulmonary embolism.


A D-dimer test measures ""fibrin degradation fragments"" in the blood. In other words, it is a measure of the presence of clotting factors in the blood (hence why it is useful in the investigation of a potential blood clot in the lung - aka a pulmonary embolism).Other blood tests will also be performed to rule out other medical conditions that may present similarly to a pulmonary embolism, such as a heart attack or heart arrhythmia.
For instance, your doctor will test your troponin levels (a heart-related enzyme) to assess for a possible heart attack.

, Another test that will be done immediately when you arrive in the Emergency Room with symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary embolism is an ECG (electrocardiogram). You may also receive ongoing cardiac monitoring - which is basically continuous ECGs recorded on a monitor that your doctor can see and watch over a period of time.


The ECG (or cardiac monitor) may show characteristic signs of a pulmonary embolism, such as the characteristic S1Q3T3 pattern.Alternatively, a completely normal ECG (or an ECG with no abnormalities other than a faster than usual heart beat) may also be indicative of a pulmonary embolism, as this condition does not always present with overt signs on the ECG tracing (or cardiac monitor).
An ECG (or cardiac monitor) can also be used to rule out other conditions, such as a heart attack (which may show elevated ""ST segments,"" an abnormality not consistent with a pulmonary embolism).

, A dye will be injected intravenously prior to the CT angio scan. The purpose of this is to allow your doctor to clearly visualize the blood flow in the arteries of your lungs (due to the intravenous contrast) when the CT angio scan is performed.


That way, if there is a blockage of blood flow in your lungs due to a pulmonary embolism, the location and size of the embolism(s) can be detected.
The diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism can be confirmed via a CT angio scan, and treatment can be initiated following diagnosis.

, This is similar to a CT angio scan, but it is used much less frequently (it was the more prevalent diagnostic test for pulmonary embolism in the past) and it is not as effective as the CT angio scan. A V/Q scan may be used if there is a contraindication to the iv contrast such as an allergy, or kidney problem.


What happens in a V/Q scan is that a radioactive substance is injected into your bloodstream (which will then travel up to the blood in your lungs). The injection is the Q (perfusion), and then the V part comes when the patient inhales another radioactive tracer.
A picture is then taken, which detects the pattern of the radioactive materials the patient had injected and inhaled.
Similar to the CT angio scan, a V/Q scan can identify the location and size of a potential pulmonary embolism based on absent or disrupted blood flow to a certain area(s) of the lung.

, In this test, a catheter (tube) is inserted through your femoral vein (a vein in your groin area), and guided up towards the blood vessels in your lungs. Contrast material is then released, which spreads through your lungs according to the pattern of blood flow. Your doctor will then perform an x-ray to look at the distribution of the contrast and to hopefully diagnose (or rule out) a pulmonary embolism.


Because pulmonary angiography is the most invasive diagnostic test, it is generally used as a last resort when the other tests prove inconclusive or have confusing results. But even though it is not used commonly for diagnosis, it can be a good option since an IVC filter can be placed at the same time, or in some cases the clot can be extracted.

, The purpose of an anticoagulant medication is not to dissolve the current clot, but rather, to prevent the formation of any new clots (and to allow the current clot to dissolve with your body's natural mechanisms).


An injected anticoagulant is often given for the first five to 10 days of therapy, followed by oral (pill form) anticoagulant medications for three to six months following the pulmonary embolism. However, in some cases the anticoagulation medication will need to be lifelong.
Examples of anticoagulant medications include low molecular weight heparin given by an injection under the skin (such as enoxaparin/Lovenox, or fondaparinux/Arixtra, which is a factor Xa inhibitor), unfractionated heparin given by IV injection, or oral anticoagulants given in pill form (such as rivaroxaban/Xarelto, or apixaban/Eliquis)., This is when a ""clot-busting"" drug is given to actively dissolve the clot. This is then followed up with anticoagulation therapy.

, This is typically inserted through your femoral vein (in your groin), and guided up to your inferior vena cava (the big blood vessel that feeds into the heart), where it sits. Reasons ""against"" anticoagulant medication (and ""for"" the insertion of a clot filter) include:


Recent surgery
A recent stroke
Significant bleeding in another area of the body, such as recent GI bleeding

, Catheter-directed thrombolysis may be performed to remove a blood clot from a vein or artery. In this procedure, a catheter will be inserted into an artery or vein and the images will be used to find the clot. When the clot is located, medication or a device will be used to break up the clot.


This procedure is minimally invasive.
You will be sedated during the procedure.
If medications are used to break up the clot, then the catheter may be left in place for up to 72 hours to break up the clot. When the clot has been broken up, the catheter will be removed and the wound will be bandaged., What this entails is surgical removal of the clot from the lung, to resolve blood flow in the lungs and alleviate symptoms and patient distress.

, The cause may have been a ""one-time thing,"" such as developing a pulmonary embolism following surgery which put you at risk due to immobilization. Or, if you have not been exposed to any recent risk factors, your doctor may perform a series of tests to assess for underlying clotting disorders or other conditions that may have been responsible for the formation of your blood clot.

Manage the condition.",How to Diagnose Paget's Disease," While Paget's disease may have no symptoms at first onset, many with the disease do have a history of joint or bone pain. If you have painful bones or joints, especially in the pelvis, skull, spine, or legs, it could be a symptom of Paget's disease.However, there are many causes of painful joints, including arthritis and wear and tear on the joint. Discuss any joint pain you have with your doctor and have them assess your situation.;
, If you have pain in your joints and bones you should assess whether you have other symptoms associated with Paget's disease. These additional symptoms include:Headaches
Hearing loss
Bones changing shape
Tingling or numbness

, There are some factors that can increase your likelihood of getting Paget's disease. Most importantly, it usually only affects people older than 40 years old and it can be hereditary. This means that if a family member has it, you are more likely to have it as well. Also, it does affect slightly more men than women.Remember that overall this is a very rare disease. Just because you have some risk factors and you have joint pain that does not mean you have Paget's disease.

, If you suspect that there is a problem with your bones, then you should schedule a medical exam. Your doctor will discuss your symptoms with you and get a full medical history from you.


When calling to make an appointment, tell the person on the phone ""I have been having pain in my joints and bones and I am concerned that I may have Paget's disease. There is a history of this condition in my family. Could you please tell the doctor about my concern?"" This will allow the doctor to do some research on the condition before you come in.
The doctor is also likely to give you a physical exam that focuses on identifying areas of pain and discomfort.

, If the doctor suspects Paget's disease or some other issue with your bones, they may do an x-ray. An x-ray will allow them to get a look at the structure of the bones and may allow them to identify areas that have potential problems.The x-rays may be done in your doctor's office or you may need to go to a different medical office to have them done.

, If your doctor suspects that you have a problem with your bones but needs more information than an x-ray can provide, then they may recommend that you undergo a bone scan. This is a radiological procedure used to identify any areas of physical or chemical change in the bones.With a bone scan the doctor should be able to see any areas of weakness or overgrowth that could be associated with Paget's disease.


Once the bone scan is done, your doctor should discuss the results of the bone scan with you.

, People with Paget's Disease have elevated levels of an enzyme called serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) in their blood. Your doctor may draw your blood and send it to a lab to test for this.Your doctor may also do a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to test calcium levels and liver health, or a Vitamin D test., In most cases of Paget's disease, bisphosphonates will be prescribed. These are medications commonly used for treating osteoporosis, as they are used to strengthen bones. With Paget's disease, they can help strengthen bones that have weakness due to improper regeneration.Bisphosphonates used to treat Paget's disease include: Alendronate (Fosamax), Ibandronate (Boniva), Pamidronate (Aredia), Risedronate (Actonel), and Zoledronic acid (Zometa, Reclast).

, In some cases, surgery may also be recommended to fix fractures that have healed incorrectly or to realign poorly formed bones. This is an extreme treatment for Paget's disease and may not be necessary for all those afflicted.Discuss the option of surgery with your doctor. If they do not have enough experience with the disease, you may need to consult with a specialist to assess whether surgery is right for you.

, In addition to medical treatment, there are some things you can do at home to help keep Paget's disease under control. These things include preventing falls, increasing your exercise, and controlling your diet.Preventing falls requires that you eliminate risky behaviors and activities. Sports that often cause injury, such as American football, should be avoided. If all risky activities cannot be completely avoided, you should at least wear all of the appropriate protective clothing, such as knee pads, to prevent injury.
While you want to make sure you don't injure yourself, it is important to continue, or begin, exercising. Exercising helps to strengthen muscles and bones, which can help to stave off the negative side effects of Paget's disease. Do exercises that do not have a large risk of injury to the bones, including gentle stretching and non-impact exercises like swimming.
Also, it's important to maintain a healthy diet. A good diet for Paget's disease includes foods that are high in calcium and vitamin D. These nutrients are essential for bone health and strength, and can be taken as supplements if you cannot incorporate enough of them into your diet.

Maintain a clean and hygienic home to ensure all infections are kept at bay.",How to Protect Children from Infectious Diseases," It is the most basic and effective way of maintaining a basic hygiene level. If your child is old enough to wash his/ her hands on his/ her own, then teach them the appropriate way of doing so. If not, you need to ensure you wash your child’s hand frequently.

Keeping your infant’s hands clean at all times cuts down the chances of him/her developing an infection. Help your child understand the importance and teach him/her the correct technique of doing so.;
, If you or any of your family members has caught an infection, try to ensure that the infected does not come in contact with the toddler too often. In fact, if possible, try to keep the two away from each other until the infection has worn off.

Children haven't necessarily developed strong immune systems yet, and hence they are easily susceptible to an infection.

, Be sure to carry out all your responsibilities and strengthen your baby by boosting his/her immunity. Talk to your child's doctor about the immunization options and recommended schedule. Missing out on a shot could cause your child to catch an infection, further compromising your child’s overall health., Wiping down surfaces, especially in the kitchen and bathroom, on a regular basis will help your child grow in a clean environment, keeping him/her healthy and happy."

Watch for your baby's schedule.",How to Promote Safe Sleep for Your Baby," Babies can overheat or suffocate if the crib is full of soft materials that block the baby's face, especially if she hasn't learned to roll over yet. Your baby should sleep in a crib or bed that has a firm mattress and a clean fitted sheet. Don't put any blankets, pillows or soft toys in it.You should also avoid using crib bumpers which can suffocate, entrap, or strangle a baby. Most health authorities recommend against using them.;
, While you shouldn't necessarily sleep with the baby in your bed, keeping the baby in your room during the first six months can reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Your baby learns to regulate his breathing, you can respond to feeding demands, and calm any fussiness quickly when you share a room.You can keep the baby in a crib, bassinet, or bed extender in your room.
Consider moving the baby to his own room when you find that you're keeping him awake or his subtle movements keep you awake. Most people begin moving their babies into separate rooms at around 6 months old., If you're breastfeeding and would like easy access to your baby at night, you might be considering co-sleeping. To co-sleep safely, place the baby next to you on a firm mattress, but make sure that there's a guardrail preventing the baby from rolling off of the bed. Choose one without slats to keep the baby's limbs from getting stuck in the rail. Always put the baby down on her back and make sure everyone in the bed has enough room to move. Be aware that even when done safely, studies show that babies who co-sleep are at higher risk of SIDS than those who sleep in their own crib. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against bed-sharing.To avoid dangerous co-sleeping situations, avoid:Placing the baby in the middle of the bed between both parents.
Co-sleeping if you're on medications, have been drinking, or are exhausted.
Co-sleeping if you're obese.
Co-sleeping on a soft surface like a couch or waterbed.
Co-sleeping if you're not the baby's mother or father since you're probably not as attuned to when the baby rouses.

, If your baby is bottle fed, don’t give leave a bottle in the crib when you put the baby down for naps or bedtime. Babies can learn to depend on the bottle to fall asleep and the bottle is a choking hazard.


Research has shown that leaving the bottle in the crib with the baby can increase the risk of tooth decay and ear infections., While your mother or grandmother might swear by putting a baby down on her tummy, research shows that babies who sleep on their stomachs (even during nap times) are at a much higher risk for SIDS. Once your baby begins rolling over, don't worry if she rolls onto her stomach during the middle of the night, but always place her in the crib on her back initially.Tell your baby's caregivers — whether they're grandparents, babysitters, or child care provider s— that you want your baby to be put down on her back.

, Since you aren't putting your baby in a crib or bed with blankets and pillows, you might think that your baby will be cold and need extra layers. But, babies that are too hot are at an increased risk for SIDS. Avoid swaddling your baby since this can keep him too warm and become loose becoming a choking hazard. Adjust the temperature if you are concerned about your baby being cold as opposed to overdressing him. To tell if your baby is too hot:Feel if his neck and head are hot or sweaty
Look for a heat rash or redness on his face
Watch for rapid breathing or restlessness

, If your baby is interested in using a pacifier to calm herself, you can give it to her before naps and bedtime. Make sure the pacifier is clean, dry and not attached to any strings or clips. Research suggests that using a pacifier can decrease the risk of SIDS.If you're breastfeeding, avoid giving your baby a pacifier until she's nursing well or at least one month old.

, One of the best ways to keep your baby healthy is to keep yourself healthy. If you're currently pregnant, get regular prenatal care. You shouldn't smoke during or after pregnancy, since this can also increase your baby's risk for SIDS. Consider breastfeeding your baby since it's been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS.Get your baby immunized. Immunizations can reduce the risk of SIDS by 50%.

, While this may be difficult to do in the first few months when your baby is sleeping a lot, you should begin to develop a bedtime routine. This will teach your baby to recognize that it's time to start winding down for bed. Keep the routine simple and consistent. You should spend no more than 10 to 15 minutes on the routine. Some ideas you can include in your routine are:Bath time
Reading stories
Rocking quietly
Listening to calming music

, Put him down when he is drowsy, but before he falls asleep. Most babies will fuss for a bit before falling asleep. If your baby is a few months old, wait about five minutes before responding to crying. It's easy to get into the habit of singing, rocking, or nursing your baby to sleep, but realize that these may become sleep crutches that the baby completely relies on to fall asleep.When you do go in to calm your baby, keep the room dim and be quiet. Calm your baby by a soothing touch, feeding, or walking around holding him. Place him back in the crib or bed when he's calm and let him fall asleep on his own.

, Your baby will sleep better if she's had a busy and active day. While you don't need to constantly be showing things to your baby, you can do simple things like singing, talking, playing, showing picture books, or letting her touch things.


This is more important after the first few months. For the first few weeks, a baby can only stay awake for a couple of hours before needing another nap., When a baby is born, he has no concept of day and night, so naturally he has no idea when to consolidate sleep. To help your baby learn the day and night rhythm that adults have, keep things bright and active during the day. Then, keep things quiet, calm, and dim in the evening to help your baby settle down.Remember that each baby is different. Some babies will adapt quickly and sleep through the night at an early age while others like to stay up late and nap longer throughout the day.

, Since babies sleep needs change every month, keep track of how long and how many naps your baby takes, how long she's awake during the day, and what time she goes to bed and wakes. You may need to wake the baby in the morning so that you can start setting a sleep routine. But, many babies keep to a pretty regular wake time routine, so you could just track when your baby wakes up in the morning.


Most babies under three months old don't have much of a schedule since they're sleeping so often. Between 4 and 6 months, your baby should start sleeping longer stretches at night."

Clear phlegm or mucus from your throat by coughing.,
Gargle with warm water and salt.,
Drink plenty of liquids during the day.,
Try steam treatment.,
Use medicine that curbs mucus.",How to Clear the Throat of Mucus1," If an excess of mucus has made its home in your throat, it's okay to evict it by coughing it up. Find a remote place, such as a bathroom, and try to loosen the mucus from your throat by coughing or hacking. Make sure not to cough too hard or too much, as it can do some damage.;
, Dissolve a teaspoon of salt into 8 ounces of lukewarm or warm water. Take the water into your mouth, tilt your head back, and without swallowing, gargle the salt water in the back of your throat.








, The right liquids can help loosen the mucus from the lining of the throat as the liquids pass down the esophagus. Try the following for time-tested mucus relief:









Warm tea with lemon and honey. This should be one of your mainstays. The acidity of the lemon is good at breaking up the mucus while the honey coats the throat with a pleasant protective layer afterward.
Warm soup. Chicken soup is a favorite because the broth is light and cuts the mucus. Stick with lighter broths instead of thicker, creamier soups.
Cool water. Listen to your thirst and drink as much water as you need to stay satiated.

, Give yourself a steam treatment and let warm steam travel down your sinus and throat, loosening up some of the mucus that's lodged there. Try the following for relief:









Wrap a towel around your head and breathe in the steam issuing from warm water. Even better, steep some tea (chamomile works great) in a large pot, carefully lower your head over being and breathe in the steam.
Take warm showers. If you take a long shower, be sure to moisturize afterward as warm water robs your skin of essential oils and moisture.
Use a humidifier/vaporizer. Allow your humidifier to pump moist air into your room. Take care not to pump too much moisture into the air; a little bit goes a long way.

, Generic medicine, like Mucinex, is available to thin out and loosen mucus. Look for medicines that are labeled ""expectorants,"" which means to clear out phlegm or mucus.

Use eucalyptus oil.,
Add turmeric powder to liquids to keep the digestive tract working.,
Eat spicy foods to get the mucus loose and runny.",How to Clear the Throat of Mucus2," Eucalyptus oil has long been used as an herbal mucus relief product. The most effective way to use eucalyptus oil is to line the upper chest area with a carrier oil such as coconut oil and then rub in a few drops of the eucalyptus oil. This might make you cough a little more than expected, at first, but after a while it should help loosen mucus from your throat.









Add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your vaporizer for another effective treatment option. Do not take eucalyptus oil orally.

, Turmeric also works as an antiseptic. Add a one tablespoon of turmeric and one tablespoon honey to 8 ounces of hot water, dissolving. Drink the liquid, and repeat for best results.








, The list of spicy foods that can aid in mucus relief is long. A few foods you might eat include:









Wasabi or horseradish
Peppers, such as jalapeno or Anaheim
Ginger and even garlic

Stay away from milk and dairy.,
Stay away from soy products.,
Stop smoking.,
Avoid other irritants such as strong chemicals or paints.",How to Clear the Throat of Mucus3," Although many disputethe evidence that dairy makes mucus worse, it's best to avoid it if you think that mucus may get worse after you reach for the milk. That's because the fat content in milk may be high, making mucus thicker and more irritating.








, Soy products, such as soymilk, tofu, and tempeh, although rich in protein and otherwise healthy for you, may increase the viscosity of mucus and cause buildups of mucus in the chest. If you have a choice, it may be better to stay on the safe side and avoid soy.








, Just another reason — one of many — to quit smoking if you haven't already. Smoking irritates the throat, worsens respiratory function, and causes congestion.








, Paints and household cleaners such as ammonia may be irritating to the nose and throat, causing further mucus production.

"
Know if you have a cold.,
Know if you may have post-nasal drip.,
Know if the mucus is being caused by seasonal allergies or an allergic reaction.,
Know that being pregnant can exacerbate mucus production.",How to Clear the Throat of Mucus4," You probably know whether or not you have a cold. But do you know why colds are accompanied by persistent mucus? Mucus performs two functions:









It coats organs, keeping them moisturized and preventing them from drying out.
It acts as a kind of first defense against pollutants and bacteria, which often get caught in the mucus before infiltrating the rest of the body.

, Post-nasal drip is when your body produces excess mucus, and the mucus runs down your throat instead of out your nose.Post-nasal drip can be caused by colds and allergies, certain medications (including medicines for hypertension), deviated septa, and fumes from irritants. Call your doctor if your drainage is foul-smelling or lasts for longer than 10 days.








, Allergies can stimulate the production of mucus. Mucus caused by allergies is usually clear, whereas mucus caused by a cold or flu is usually greenish yellow.If you're susceptible to allergies, avoid going outside on days when the pollen count is high, and stay away from:









Mold
Animal dander
Dust mites

, If you recently found out you are pregnant, that could explain your problem with mucus. While there's not anything you can take, aside from decongestants like Claritin, it should be comforting to know that your ramped-up mucus production won't last forever.

Look for unusual infections.,
Look for skin manifestations of a primary immunodeficiency.,
Look for a lack of response to antibiotics.",How to Diagnose Primary Immunodeficiency1," If you suffer from a variety of infections in several different organs or parts of your body, or have frequent (chronic) infections, you may have a primary immunodeficiency disease. Some of the most common conditions and infections that appear in cases of primary immunodeficiency include:Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, such as pneumonia (with fever), otitis media (inflammation of the ear, and sinusitis (chronic sinus infections)
Meningitis (inflammation of the swelling of tissues near the brain or spinal cord) or sepsis (a condition in which the blood becomes infected)
Gastrointestinal infections (infections of the gut)
Cutaneous infections (infections of the skin);
, In addition to cutaneous infections, you might develop any number of noninfectious skin conditions – rashes, sores, or scaly skin – if you have a primary immunodeficiency. These conditions include:Eczematous lesions (an area of damaged skin brought on by severe eczema, a condition that causes itchy, irritated skin)
Erythroderma (scaly skin)
Cutaneous granulomas (red, raised sores or bumps)
Dysplasia of skin (light pigmentation with dark skin covering areas that suffered injury), hair (uneven color or patchiness, or the absence of eyebrows), and nails (thick, flaky, ridged, or abnormally shaped)

, If you were prescribed antibiotics for an infection but they prove useless, you may have a primary immunodeficiency. On the other hand, if you’ve used a particular antibiotic for a long time, you may have developed resistance to that particular drug. In either case, let your doctor know that your antibiotics are ineffective so they can provide an accurate diagnosis."

Visit your doctor.,
Get a genetic analysis.,
Look for the presence of unusual bacteria.,
Look for certain allergic and autoimmune conditions.,
Get an X-ray.,
Get a CT scan.,
Get a blood test.,
Examine your family history.",How to Diagnose Primary Immunodeficiency2," Only a trained medical doctor can accurately determine whether you or someone in your family has a primary immunodeficiency disease. If you don’t have a doctor, visit the Immune Deficiency Foundation’s “Ask IDF” page for help locating one who is knowledgeable about primary immunodeficiencies., Molecular-level genetic analyses can identify errors or mutations in your genome that your doctor can use to diagnose a primary immunodeficiency disorder. You likely have a primary immunodeficiency disease if you have the symptoms of a particular disorder, but you do not have an abnormality associated with that disorder in your genes or mRNA, or if you lack the proteins known to cause the disorder.There are several techniques available to your doctor for analyzing your genetic profile. They might take a blood sample or a swab of skin from the inside of your cheek (known as a buccal swab). It could even be as simple as spitting into a cup or swishing and spitting with mouthwash.

, If you have a primary immunodeficiency disease, you might find yourself playing host to bacteria like atypical mycobacteria (which suggests an IFN-yR defect), Pneumocystis jirovecii (which suggests Severe Combined Immunodeficiency – also known as SCID – or Hyper IgM syndrome).Your doctor will detect these bacteria when analyzing mucous or other bodily fluid samples involved in identifying your infection.IFN-yR defects are genetic irregularities that produce greater susceptibility to mycobacteria, including the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, a serious lung disease.
Hyper IgM syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency with five types. Each variation is associated with defective genes that lead to symptoms like frequent infections, hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.
SCID is a serious immunodeficiency characterized by defective T and B cells. People with SCID must often live in a totally sterile environment because they are extra-susceptible to infections.

, Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which the body’s immune system is not only not defending you from external threat, but it actually attacks the cells of your own body. Allergic reactions are an example of an autoimmune condition. Symptoms of allergies or autoimmune conditions that you might experience with a primary immunodeficiency include:itchy, red, watery eyes
sneezing
coughing
an itchy throat
wheezing or difficulty breathing

, An X-ray can diagnose whether you have sinusitis, lung disease, or a similar pulmonary condition that could indicate a primary immunodeficiency disease. X-rays are painless procedures in which you visit a hospital or doctor’s clinic and have a portion of your body imaged with a special device, known as an X-ray machine. The X-ray image the results can help doctors see through your skin and into your skeleton and other internal bodily structures., A CT (computed tomography) scan is not unlike an X-ray. Like the X-ray, a CT scan is painless and allows your doctor to examine your chest, abdomen, and pelvis for infection and other irregularities. But while the X-ray produces only a single image at a time, a CT scan uses computers to produce a layered image, and even three-dimensional images to get a better sense of what’s going on inside you.CT scans are also useful for determining pulmonary function and detecting lung and sinus problems which, if they continue, could indicate a primary immunodeficiency disease.
If you get a CT scan, you’ll be asked to fast for 12 hours prior to getting the scan. Wear loose, comfortable clothing to the appointment and do not wear jewelry.
During the actual scan, you’ll have to lie down on a slab which then slides inside a tube. The tube rotates around you and you will have to lie still until the scan is complete.

, If you have a primary immunodeficiency, your B cells (a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies) and T cells (a type of white blood cell responsible for controlling fungal infections) might be dysfunctional. A blood test can determine if your B and T cells are operating properly. To get a blood test, schedule an appointment with your doctor.Your doctor will clean the skin above the vein from which your blood will be drawn with an antiseptic. They might also tie off the arm just above the site of the puncture.
You will feel a small prick as the needle enters your vein.Afterwards, the doctor will bandage the site where they drew your blood. You might be asked to sit or lie down for a few minutes.

, Primary immunodeficiencies are often inherited from a family member. If your parents, grandparents, siblings, or other family members had a primary immunodeficiency, you are more likely to have one, also.If you are unsure about your family history, ask a parent or other relative if they know of anyone in your family with a primary immunodeficiency.
Write down as much information as possible, including symptoms and the name of the specific immunodeficiency disease they had, and provide your doctor with this information.

Look for developmental anomalies.,
Look for a failure to thrive.,
Look for developmental delays.,
Watch for chronic infections.",How to Diagnose Primary Immunodeficiency3," Developmental anomalies – abnormal instance of growth or development – could indicate the presence of a primary immunodeficiency. Developmental anomalies might appear in the heart, pigmentation of the skin, skeleton, or face.For instance, if your child gets a checkup and the doctor finds that they have a structural defect or cardiomyopathy (a condition in which the heart struggles to deliver blood to the body), a primary immunodeficiency could be the cause., Failure to thrive is a condition in which your child cannot gain weight or grow at a healthy rate.If your child has failed to thrive – due, perhaps, to a recurring illness – this could be an important clue as to whether they have a primary immunodeficiency. Take your child to the doctor for regular checkups as they grow.Failure to thrive is typically diagnosed when your child is just a baby. As a baby, your child should double in weight over its first four months.
By 12 months old, your baby should have tripled its weight.
Your child’s doctor will be able to tell you how often they should be seen and what you can do to correct the failure to thrive, even if it’s not caused by a primary immunodeficiency.

, Another childhood condition that could provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency is developmental delay.This describes a range of potential conditions and behaviors. If you have concerns about your child’s development, contact your doctor so they can diagnose your child.A developmental delay might mean that the child:


does not learn at the same rate as their peers
cannot speak or understand speech at an age-appropriate level
has trouble with coordination, mobility, or balance
does not engage in social behavior appropriate for their age

, Either mild or severe chronic infections may also indicate that a child may have a primary immunodeficiency. Tell your child’s doctor about any infections the child has had, including:skin infections
colds
ear infections
lung infections
allergies

Determine how severe your throat pain is.Severe throat pain is usually the first sign of strep throat.,
Try swallowing.,
Smell your breath.,
Feel the glands in your neck.,
Check your tongue.,
Check the back of your throat.,
Check your tonsils if you still have them.,
Note if you have been around someone with strep throat.,

Pay attention to any headaches.,
Monitor any digestive symptoms.,
Take fatigue into account.,
Look for a rash.,
Note any absent symptoms.,
Examine your medical history.,
Assess whether your age makes it likely that you have contracted strep throat.,
Figure out if your living situation increases your risk of strep throat.,
Assess whether you have any health risk factors that might make more susceptible to strep throat.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Let the doctor know about your concerns.,
Expect your doctor to go through a clinical diagnosis protocol.,
Ask the doctor for a rapid strep test.The Center criteria has not proven effective in predicting antibiotic treatment-worthy infection in children.,
Ask the doctor for a throat culture.,
Find out about other testing options.,
Take your antibiotics if prescribed by your doctor.,
Stay comfortable and rest while the antibiotics take effect.,
Follow up with your doctor if you need to.",How to Tell if You Have Strep Throat," You may still have strep throat even if you are only experiencing moderate throat pain, but a mild sore throat that is easily remedied or soothed is not likely to be caused by strep.


The soreness should not be dependent on anything such as talking or swallowing.
Soreness that can be dulled with pain medication or partially soothed with cold liquid and food might still be related to strep throat, but it is usually quite difficult to rid yourself of the soreness completely without prescription medication.;
, If your throat is only moderately sore but becomes very painful when you swallow, you may have strep. Pain during swallowing that makes it difficult to swallow is especially common in people suffering from strep throat.

, While bad breath does not occur in all patients, the infection caused by streptococcus bacteria can often cause notably bad breath. This occurs as a result of the reproduction of the bacteria.


While potent, the exact smell can be difficult to describe. Some state that it smells like metal or hospitals, while others compare it to rotten meat. Regardless of the exact odor, ""strep breath"" will smell stronger and worse than normal bad breath.
Due to the somewhat subjective nature of “bad breath,” this is not really a way to diagnose strep throat, but rather a commonly seen association., Lymph nodes trap and destroy germs. The lymph nodes in your neck will usually be swollen and tender to the touch if you have strep throat.


While lymph nodes are located in various parts of your body, the first nodes to swell are usually those that are nearest to the source of infection. In the case of strep throat, the lymph nodes in and around your throat will be the ones to swell.Use your fingertips to gently feel the area directly in front of your ear. Move your fingertips in a circular motion behind your ear.Also check the area of your throat just below the chin. The most common site of lymph node swelling with strep throat is under your jaw, about midway between your chin and your ear. Move your fingertips back and up toward the ear, then down the side of the neck below the ear.
Finish by checking the collarbone and repeating on both sides.
If you can feel notable swelling or bulging in any of these areas, your lymph nodes might be swollen due to strep., People with strep throat often have a prickly coating of tiny red dots along their tongue, especially toward the back of the mouth.Most people compare this prickly coating to the outside of a strawberry.


These red dots can either be bright red or dark red. They generally appear to be inflamed.

, Many who suffer from strep throat develop petechiae, red spots on the soft or hard palate (on the roof of the mouth, near the back.)

, Strep throat will usually cause your tonsils to become inflamed. They will appear a brighter or deeper red than usual and will be notably enlarged. You may also notice that the tonsils are coated in patches of white. These patches of white can be located directly on the tonsils or simply in the back of the throat. They can also appear yellow instead of white.Instead of white patches, you may notice long streaks of white pus coating your tonsils.This is also a symptom of strep throat.

, The infection is contagious and is spread through direct contact with the bacteria that causes it. It is unlikely that you will develop strep throat without having had direct contact with someone who is infected.


It can be very difficult to know if someone else has strep. Unless you have been isolated completely, you probably could have come in contact with someone who has the infection.
It is also possible for individuals to carry and pass on strep without having symptoms themselves.

, A sore throat associated with streptococcus usually develops without warning and worsens very quickly. If your throat became increasingly sore over the course of several days, another cause is most likely to blame.


However, this alone does not rule out strep throat.

, Strep throat is usually accompanied by a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or higher. A lower fever could still be caused by strep, but it is more likely to be a symptom of a viral infection.

, Headaches are another common symptom of strep throat. They can range in severity from mild to excruciating.

, If you lose your appetite or feel nauseous, you can count that as another possible symptom of strep throat. At its worst, strep throat can even lead to vomiting and stomach pain.

, As with any infection, strep throat can lead to increased fatigue. You may find it harder to wake up in the morning than usual and harder to make it through the day.

, Severe strep throat infections can cause a condition known as scarlatina, more commonly referred to as scarlet fever.This red rash will look and feel very similar to sandpaper.


Scarlet fever usually surfaces 12 to 48 hours after your first strep throat symptoms emerge.
The rash usually begins around the neck before developing and spreading over the chest. It can also spread to the abdomen and groin areas. In rare cases, it may appear on the back, arms, legs, or face.
When treated with antibiotics, scarlet fever generally clears up quickly. If you notice a rash of this nature, you should visit the doctor as soon as possible, regardless of whether or not other strep throat symptoms are present.

, While colds and strep throat share many symptoms, there are several cold-like symptoms that people with strep throat tend not to display. The absence of these symptoms can be another sign that you have strep throat, rather than a cold.


Strep throat does not usually cause nasal symptoms. This means that you will not experience a cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, or red, itchy eyes.Additionally, while strep throat can cause stomach pain, it does not usually cause diarrhea.

, Some people seem to be more prone to developing strep infections than others. If you have a history of strep infections, it is more likely that a new infection could also be strep.

, While 20%-30% of sore throats in children are due to strep throat, only 5%-15% of sore throat visits to the doctor by adults are due to strep throat.Elderly patients, as well as individuals with concurrent illness (such as the flu), are more susceptible to opportunistic infections.

, There is often a higher likelihood of strep throat when other family members have had strep throat in the past two weeks.Shared indoor living or play spaces such as schools, daycares, dormitories, and military barracks, are examples of environments that pose a potential for colonization of bacteria.


While children are at higher risk for strep throat, babies under age 2 are much less likely to be infected with strep throat. However, they may not have the usual symptoms as older children and adults. They may have a fever, runny nose, or cough as well as a decreased appetite. Ask your doctor about your baby's risk of getting strep throat if you or another close contact has strep and they have a fever or other symptoms.

, Immunocompromised individuals, those with the decreased ability to fight off infection, may be more at risk. Other infections or illnesses can also increase the chances that you have strep.


Your immune system may be compromised simply due to fatigue. States of extreme exertion or exercise (such as running a marathon) can also tax your body. As your body focuses on recovery, it’s ability to fight infection may be impeded. Simply put, an exhausted body is focused on recovery and may not be able to defend itself as efficiently.
Smoking can cause damage to your protective mucosa in the mouth and allow for easier colonization of bacteria.
Oral Sex can expose your oral cavity to be more directly exposed to bacteria.
Diabetes decreases the ability of your body to fight infection.

, While you don't need to see the doctor every time a sore throat pops up, some potential strep throat symptoms should cause you to make an appointment right away. If your sore throat is accompanied by swollen lymph nodes, a rash, difficulty swallowing or breathing, a high fever, or a fever lasting more than 48 hours, call the doctor for an appointment.You should also talk to your doctor if your sore throat lasts longer than 48 hours.

, Bring the doctor a thorough list of your symptoms and let them know that you suspect strep might be to blame. Your doctor will usually check for some of the most telling signs of the disease.


Expect your doctor to take your temperature.
Also expect your doctor to look inside your throat with a light. He or she will most likely want to check for swollen tonsils, a red bumpy tongue rash, or white or yellow spots in the back of the throat.

, This protocol is basically an organized way for your doctor to assess your symptoms. For adults, your doctor may use what is known as a Modified Center Clinical Prediction Rule in order to empirically indicate how likely it is that you have a group A Streptococcal infection. This is simply a list of criteria that the doctor checks for to determine whether (and how) you should be treated for strep throat.The doctor will tally points, positive or negative, for signs and symptoms: +1 point for milky, white spots on the tonsils (tonsillar exudates), +1 point for tender lymph nodes (tender anterior chain cervical adenopathy), +1 point for a history of recent fever, +1 point for less than 15 years of age, +0 point for an age between 15-45 years old, -1 point for being greater than 45 years old, and -1 point for a cough.
If you score 3-4 points, then there is a positive predictive value (PPV) of roughly 80% that you have a group A streptococcal infection. Basically, you are considered positive for strep. This infection should be treated with antibiotics and your doctor will prescribe the proper regimen., A rapid strep antigen test may be performed in the office and only takes a few minutes to complete.The doctor will use a cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) to sample the fluids in the back of your throat for bacteria. These fluids will then be tested in the office, and within 5 to 10 minutes, you should know the results.

, If the results of your rapid strep test are negative but you still exhibit other strep throat symptoms, the doctor may want to administer a longer test known as a throat culture. A throat culture will attempt to colonize bacteria outside of your throat in a lab. As the bacteria colony collected from your throat grows, it will become easier to detect larger amounts of group A streptococcus bacteria. Your doctor will likely use any combination of the Center criteria, rapid strep test, and throat culture, depending on his or her clinical judgment.While rapid strep tests alone are usually enough to determine whether or not a strep infection is present, false-negatives have been known to occur. Throat cultures, by comparison, are more accurate.
A throat culture is not needed if the rapid strep test comes back positive, as the rapid strep test directly tests for antigens to the bacteria and will only test positive if a threshold level of bacteria are present. This would indicate immediate treatment with antibiotics.The doctor will use a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from the back of your throat. The doctor will send the swab to a lab and the lab will transfer that sample to an agar plate. The plate will incubate for 18-48 hours depending on the methodology of the specific lab. If you have strep throat, then Beta Streptococcus Group A bacteria will grow in the dish., Some doctors prefer a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) instead of a throat culture for negative rapid tests. This test is accurate and shows a result in a matter of hours, instead of requiring 1-2 days of incubation., Strep throat is a bacterial infection and, as such, is treated effectively with antibiotics.If you have any known allergies to antibiotics (such as penicillin), it is important to let your doctor know so he or she can provide you with appropriate alternatives.


A typical course of antibiotics is usually up to 10 days (depending on specific antibiotics decided by your doctor). Be sure to take your antibiotics for the fully prescribed time, even if you feel better before you finish the full course.
Penicillin, Amoxicillin, cephalosporins, and Azithromycin are all common antibiotics that can be used to treat an infection. Penicillin is used often and effectively in the treatment of Strep throat. However, some individuals may have allergic reactions to this medication. You should let your doctor know if you are aware of this possible side effect. Amoxicillin is another drug of choice for strep throat with good results. It is similar to penicillin in effectiveness and can withstand the gastric acid in your stomach better before being absorbed into your system. Additionally, it has a broader activity spectrum than penicillin.
Azithromycin, Erythromycin, or cephalosporins are used as an alternative to Penicillin when a person is known to have allergies to penicillin. Note that erythromycin has higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects in people., The typical recovery should take about as long as you take antibiotics (up to 10 days). While you are healing, give your body the opportunity to recover.


Extra sleep, herbal teas, and plenty of fluids can help alleviate throat pain while you recover.
In addition, it is sometimes helpful to consume cold beverages, ice cream, and popsicles to ease throat pain., You should feel better in 2-3 days; if you do not, or if you still have a fever, call your doctor. Additionally, if you show any signs of an allergic reaction to the antibiotics, call your doctor immediately. Signs of a reaction include a rash, hives, or swelling after taking an antibiotic.

Try to take note of where, exactly, you're having chest pain, as well as if certain actions make it feel worse, such as coughing or lying down.Chest pain associated with pericarditis is generally sharp and quick, not drawn out.Coughing or lying down will often make the pain feel worse. Coughing can be a symptom of this condition, too.Pain can also be in your back, neck, shoulder, or middle region.;
, Sometimes, this condition can make it harder to breathe. You'll particularly notice it when you're lying down, so pay attention. If you notice this symptom, you need to talk to your doctor, particularly if it is in conjunction with other symptoms., Of course, everyone feels extra tired from time to time; however, sometimes tiredness has a cause. It's your body's way of telling you there's something wrong. If you notice you just don't have the energy you need or that you're feeling weak, you may want to talk to your doctor, particularly if you're having other symptoms., With this condition, you may have a low fever. If you're feeling a bit warm, try taking your temperature to see if you're running a fever. In addition, you might notice swelling in your legs or abdomen., Often, pericarditis develops after another type of infection, so note if you have these symptoms after having a cold or pneumonia, for instance. It may also develop after a bacterial or fungal infection., Likely one of the first things the doctor will do is listen to your heart with a stethoscope. The doctor will be listening for a ""rubbing"" sound, which is your pericardium rubbing against the outer layer of your heart. This rubbing is caused by fluid building up in your chest or by the swelling of your pericardium., Another symptom your doctor will be listening for is crackling sounds. These sounds could indicate fluid in your lungs or pericardium, a complication of pericarditis., Your doctor will also listen carefully to your heartbeat, to see if it sounds muffled. Your breathing may be a little labored, too, which your doctor will be able to hear more clearly with the stethoscope., Imaging tests can give your doctor a better picture of your heart, helping with diagnosis. Your doctor may order imaging tests such as an MRI, an echocardiogram, an electrocardiogram, a chest x-ray, or a CT scan., While the symptoms above could indicate pericarditis, some of them could also point to other conditions, such as a heart attack or blood clots. Your doctor will need to analyze the images to determine which condition you have., Pericarditis is often a symptom of another problem, so your doctor will likely do a few more tests to diagnose where the problem came from. The doctor might need to do a biopsy of the pericardium (take a small tissue sample) or a pericardial fluid aspiration to help determine the cause, though the doctor may not able to determine a cause.A pericardial fluid aspiration means removing fluid that has developed around the heart. This procedure can be done to figure out what kind of infection you have, but it may also be done to help treat your condition.
This procedure is done through inserting a needle into your chest to withdraw fluid. You will be given local anesthesia as needed., Your doctor may order other tests to help diagnose the condition, such as blood tests to determine whether your blood counts indicate this condition. They may also use your blood tests to check the presence of other markers in your blood that indicate this condition."

The salt draws water out of the swollen tissues, reducing swelling.If you can deal with a bad taste, consider adding your teaspoon of salt to a mixture of equal parts warm water and apple cider vinegar. Though there’s no clear explanation for it, apple cider vinegar seems more effective than other vinegars at soothing sore throats.It’s thought that the acid in the vinegar kills the bacteria.A third option is to add ½ teaspoon of baking soda to your salt-water mixture., Lemon contains Vitamin C to boost your immune system, but it’s also both antibacterial and antiviral.


Don’t give honey to any child under the age of two. Young children may be susceptible to infant botulism, which can contaminate honey., Both children and adults can benefit from gargling. However, you need to watch children to make sure they spit rather than swallow the mixture. If they do swallow a bit, don’t panic. Just have them drink a full glass of water.


Give children a small amounts of mixture to gargle.
Test children’s gargling ability with plain water before using the solution.
Take the gargling mixture into your mouth and tilt your head back. Make an “ah” sound to create vibrations in your throat. You might have children say “GGGAAAAARRRRRRGGGGLLLE” instead. Do this for about 30 seconds.
You should be able to feel the liquid moving around from the vibration — almost like it’s boiling in the back of your throat.
Do not swallow any of the fluid. Spit it out and wash out your mouth when you’re finished.

, Depending on what you’re gargling with, you may need more or less frequent gargling.


Saltwater: once every hour
Saltwater and apple cider vinegar: once every hour
Saltwater and baking soda: every two hours

Make a salt-water solution.,
Add essential oils.,
Pour the ingredients into a spray bottle.,
Use the spray as needed.",How to Cure a Sore Throat (Salt Water Method)2," Making your own soothing throat spray is very simple — you don’t need to spend money at the store. All you need is ¼ cup of filtered water and ½ teaspoon of table salt or sea salt. Make sure the water is warm when you mix them together to encourage the salt to dissolve evenly.

, A simple salt-water solution can be very soothing, but essential oils can speed up the healing process. Simply mix the essential oils well with the salt-water mixture. Two drops of any of the following essential oils can both relieve pain and fight the infection causing the sore throat:


Menthol essential oil (pain reliever) Eucalyptus essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory) Sage essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory), A one or two ounce glass bottle with a spray attachment is ideal. This size will be small enough for you to carry around with you throughout the day. You can have it both at home and on the go.

, When your throat feels particularly sore, pull out your spray bottle and give yourself a spritz. Open your mouth wide and aim the spray attachment toward the very back of your throat. Spray once or twice to soothe your irritation.

Take antibiotics for a bacterial infection.While viral infections don’t respond to antibiotics, bacterial ones do.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat foods that easy to swallow.Broths and soups are not only easy to swallow — they’ve also been shown to improve immune response.,
Avoid foods that will irritate your throat.,
Chew food thoroughly.Use a fork and knife to cut solid foods into small pieces, and chew food thoroughly to break it up.",How to Cure a Sore Throat (Salt Water Method)3," If your doctor diagnoses you with a bacterial infection, ask for a prescription for antibiotics. Make sure to take the antibiotics exactly as prescribed. Don’t stop taking them before you’ve finished the full course, even if you start feeling better. You may leave yourself open to complications or a recurrence of the infection.Eat yogurt with active cultures (probiotics) while on antibiotics.Antibiotics kill off healthy gut bacteria while fighting the infecting bacteria. Eating yogurt with active probiotic cultures will replace the normal gut bacteria, helping your body fight off the infection.

, Drinking water moisturizes the external skin on your throat, but it also keeps your whole body hydrated. This soothes the irritation from within the tissue as well. Drink eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water every day. Another way to moisturize your throat is to keep the air you’re breathing as humid as possible — especially if you live in a dry climate. Buy a humidifier or place bowls of water in rooms where you spend a lot of time.

Applesauce
Rice or well-cooked pasta
Scrambled eggs
Oatmeal
Smoothies
Well-cooked beans and legumes

, Avoid spicy foods at all costs, as they will make your throat pain much worse. The definition of spicy is broad; you might not think of pepperoni or garlic as spicy, but they will irritate your condition. Also avoid sticky foods like peanut butter or hard foods like dry toast and crackers. Acidic foods like soda and citrus juices are also off limits until your throat heals.

, Chewing also gives your saliva time to break down the food and make it easier to swallow. If swallowing is very difficult, considering blending solid foods like cooked peas or carrots into a puree.

The doctor will look at your throat, listen to your breathing, and take a throat swab for a rapid strep test. While the swab is painless, it can be slightly uncomfortable if it causes a gag reflex.The sample taken from your throat swab will be sent to a lab to figure out the cause of the infection. Once the virus or bacteria causing your throat pain is determined, the doctor can advise you on treatment.


Medications that are used to treat a sore throat caused by bacteria include penicillin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin.
The doctor may also order a CBC (complete blood count) or test your for allergies.

, Children, though, should always be checked out by a doctor if a sore throat doesn't go away with a drink of water in the morning.

Drink warm beverages and/or eat cold food for the duration of your illness.,
Make a natural tea with ingredients that are soothing for a sore throat.There are a few different options that have been shown to be helpful in sore throat.",How to Numb a Sore Throat1," Acetaminophen (Tylenol), Ibuprofen (Advil), or Naproxen (Aleve) have all been shown to be beneficial in reducing the pain of a sore throat.Ask your doctor before you take them if you are on blood thinners or other prescription medication.;
, Although this has not been proven in any conventional medical trials, it is something that is known to help with sore throats.Mix a quarter to half of a teaspoon of salt into a cup of moderately warm water. Swish and swirl this in the back of your mouth near your throat for at least 30 seconds several times a day.

, Look for the active ingredients benzocaine or phenol (either one works, both are topical anesthetics). A throat spray can help to numb an inflamed throat for a few hours., Studies have shown that they can cut the duration of a cold by half when taken at the first signs of a cold. The lozenges will also reduce inflammation, stuffiness and soreness.


If you wait more than two days after your cold has begun, the zinc lozenges are unlikely to help in terms of shortening the duration of your cold.
Regardless of when you take them, lozenges can help with symptom relief. This is because they typically contain topical anesthetic (which gently numbs the throat), and can also help with alleviate any dryness.Because lozenges (cough drops) stay in your throat longer than a salt water gargle or a throat spray, they are considered one of the most effective means of soothing a sore throat., The minty mixture will numb and soothe your throat., There are daytime and nighttime varieties.

Recognize signs and symptoms of a more serious throat infection.,
Obtain antibiotic treatment if needed.,
Know when to seek help from your doctor.,
Use prescription pain medications.",How to Numb a Sore Throat2," Although viral throat infections are far more common (and resolve on their own within a few days), if you have any symptoms suggesting something more serious, such as strep throat, it is important to be evaluated by a physician.If you have two or more of the following symptoms, it is important to see your doctor to be tested for strep throat:Fever (in particular a temperature above 100.4ºF or 38ºC)
White ""exudate"" (visible white patches) on your tonsils or the back of your throat
Enlarged lymph nodes in your neck
Absence of cough (people rarely cough when they have strep throat)
Absence of runny nose (common cold symptoms such as runny nose do not occur with strep throat)

, If it turns out you do have strep throat, this will need to be treated promptly with a course of antibiotics., If you have a severe sore throat and a fever greater than 101°F or 38.3°C that is not improving after 24 – 48 hours (and if anything only getting worse), it is best to see your physician sooner rather than later.Also, if you have swollen glands in your neck or the back of your throat that make it difficult to swallow or breathe, you should definitely see your physician right away (or, if you can't make a same-day appointment, be seen in urgent care or the emergency department of your local hospital).This could be a sign that something more serious is going on, like a mononucleosis (mono) infection or tonsillitis, both of which need medical evaluation and treatment., If you have a very serious sore throat, whether it's strep throat or otherwise, you can see your physician for prescription pain medication.Medications such as naproxen can be given to you to help you cope with the pain until your sore throat resolves.

Steep a slice of lemon or several chunks of peeled ginger (or both, or neither) in hot water for five minutes, add honey, and enjoy.Do not give honey to children under one. It contains bacteria which their bodies are unable to handle.

, Alternatively, use a cool-air humidifier to moisten the air. Dry air will further irritate your throat. Even putting your face over a steaming bowl of water and then putting a towel over your head can work to ease your sore throat, Switching to throat-friendly foods like broth, applesauce, soft fruits, or even popsicles will reduce irritation while you recover. You can freeze fruits like blueberries or canned mandarins to suck on. Make sure that they are rinsed and separated before you freeze them.

If you still have an upset stomach, drink water slowly and don't drink too much of it. In some cases, filling the stomach with too much water or drinking too quickly can cause you to vomit again. Small sips when the throat pain flares up should do the trick.
You can also try drinking a little bit of apple juice or another clear fluid.;
, If plain water doesn't ease your sore throat, try a warm beverage, such as herbal tea. The warmth of a beverage like tea can really ease the pain of a sore throat when sipped slowly.

Rest your voice.,
Keep hydrated.,
Gargle with an antiseptic solution.,
Suck on lozenges.,
Breath moist air.,
Avoid whispering.,
Avoid throat irritants.,
Talk to your doctor about antibiotics.,
Consider corticosteroids.,
Get any underlying conditions treated.",How to Treat Laryngitis," Most cases of hoarseness are caused by talking too much, particularly if you have to constantly raise (strain) your voice to be heard — noisy restaurants/bars, concerts and industrial environments can easily trigger a short-term bout of laryngitis;however, laryngitis from overuse heals pretty quickly, so resting your voice for a day or two is often the most important first step in getting your voice back.


If you find yourself at a noisy venue, either talk less or get closer to the ear of the person you're trying to converse with. Avoid shouting and having to repeat yourself.
In addition to hoarseness or voice loss, other symptoms of laryngitis include: a dry throat, sore throat, a tickling sensation in the throat that triggers a dry cough, and mucous build-up in the throat.;
, Keeping yourself well-hydrated will keep the mucus membranes of your throat moist, which helps to reduce inflammation and discomfort. With less irritation, you'll find yourself coughing and clearing your throat less often — which are factors that can prolong bouts of laryngitis/hoarseness.Avoid carbonated water because it can further tickle your throat and trigger a coughing spell.


Start with drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water per day to rehydrate yourself and keep the mucus membranes of your throat/larynx moist. Dairy-based beverages can thicken mucus.Sugary drinks may increase mucus production and should be avoided.
Consider warming some water (not too hot) to loosen nasal and throat congestion, adding a little honey and lemon. Honey can soothe a sore or irritated throat, while lemon juice is a mild antiseptic that can combat infections, as well as clear mucus from your throat., Infections of the throat can also lead to laryngitis. Viral infections are the most common, although bacterial and fungal (Candida) infections can trigger hoarseness also.If you suspect your laryngitis is caused by an infection, then gargle with antiseptic solutions that are able to kill a variety of microorganisms. A 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water is effective against bacteria and some other microbes. Gargle for at least a minute each hour until the irritation/inflammation in your throat fades away and your voice returns to full strength.


Other symptoms that may indicate your laryngitis is caused by an infection include: a mild-to-moderate fever, malaise (tiredness) and swollen lymph nodes or glands in or near your neck.Other antiseptic compounds that can be mixed in water and gargled include vinegar. Mix this into a solution of one part water to one part vinegar.

, In addition to drinking lots of water, sucking on mediated lozenges can also help keep the mucus membranes of your throat moist by stimulating saliva production.In addition, medicated lozenges (from a pharmacy) typically contain compounds that numb or dull a sore throat, which will make it easier to drink fluids and swallow food. Avoid sucking on candy because the sugar or sweetener may trigger more mucus production in your throat, forcing you to clear it more often.


Choose lozenges with zinc, honey, eucalyptus and/or lemon for the most soothing effects on your throat membranes. Zinc is also a mild antiseptic.
Ginger is also a great resource for a sore throat. Suck on pieces of dried or pickled ginger to moisten your throat and soothe the inflamed mucus membranes of the larynx.
Though stinky breath may be a concern, garlic has antiseptic properties. Chew and swallow raw garlic and try adding extra garlic into your cooking.

, Run a humidifier to keep the air in your home and bedroom humid. If you don't have a humidifier, you can add moisture to the air by hanging up a wet towel, or heating wide pans of water.

, This puts even more strain on your voice than normal speech. Instead, take a deep breath, then speak on the exhale in a relaxed voice., While you are resting your voice and gargling with antiseptics, be careful not to breathe in or consume any throat irritants. Smoking, binging on alcohol, drinking lots of carbonated beverages, consuming sweet dairy products (such as milkshakes) and inhaling dust and fumes from household cleaners can all irritate the throat and make laryngitis worse.One of the first symptoms of throat cancer (caused by smoking or alcoholism) is a chronically hoarse voice. As such, if your hoarseness lasts for more than a few weeks despite resting your voice and gargling, then contact your doctor for a consult.
Aside from overuse, infection and irritation, other causes of laryngitis include: allergic reactions, chronic acid reflux, an enlarged thyroid gland, chronic sinusitis and benign growths (polyps) on the vocal cords., If you are unable to relieve your laryngitis with the above mentioned home remedies, then make an appointment with your family doctor. A severe sore throat, swollen mucus membranes that are streaked with white pus, fever and malaise are all signs of an infection.However, only bacterial infections are impacted by antibiotics, so your doctor will likely swab your throat and determine if the infection is bacterial, viral or fungal.


If bacteria is the culprit (strep throat is a relatively common cause of laryngitis), then your doctor may prescribe a two week course of antibiotics, such as Amoxicillin or Erythromycin. Follow the doctor's instructions carefully when taking antibiotics. In particular, be sure you take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. This ensures you completely eradicate the low levels of bacteria that will remain once you are feeling better; this bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics and become extremely difficult to treat later on.
If you've had laryngitis for more than a few weeks and are a smoker, your doctor will likely refer you to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor), who may use a laryngoscopy — a small tube with a tiny camera to get a better look at the back of your throat .

, If you have severe laryngitis that's not caused by bacteria and not helped by home remedies, then ask your doctor about the pros and cons of a short course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone.Steroid medications are powerful and fast-acting anti-inflammatories that can reduce the swelling, pain and other symptoms in your throat. However, due to significant downsides, they are usually not recommended except as emergency treatments for people who must use their voices professionally.


The downside of steroidal medications is that they tend to reduce immune system function, weaken tissues and cause water retention, which is why they are typically prescribed for short periods of time only.
Corticosteroid medication comes in pills, injectables, inhalers and oral sprays, which are especially effective for quickly combating a bout of laryngitis.

, As noted above, laryngitis is caused by a variety of diseases that affect the throat. For example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often triggers laryngitis because the stomach acid that flows up the esophagus irritates and inflames the throat and larynx.Thus, treating GERD with antacid and proton-pump medications will eventually clear up the laryngitis also. Similar approaches should be used for other conditions that trigger laryngitis, such as an enlarged thyroid gland, allergies, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, benign vocal cord growths and throat cancer.


Chronic laryngitis (hoarseness) from long-term smoking can clear up on its own after quitting, although it may take many months or even a few years for the vocal cords to become healthy again.
If your child's laryngitis is caused by ""croup,"" then see your doctor immediately for the appropriate medications. Croup narrows airway passages, causes difficulty breathing and leads to a barking-like cough. It can be life-threatening in rare circumstances.

, To use the aloe vera gel on your throat you can combine it with another ingredient to make the gargling easier. Consider combining it with tea or water in order to create a product you can gargle with.


Since it is recommended not to exceed ingesting one tablespoon of aloe vera gel three times a day, consider making yourself a cup of tea and then adding a tablespoon of aloe vera gel to that. If you use this for gargling, and you only ingest a little during the act of gargling, then you know you are not exceeding the recommended daily dose., If you have a sore throat, you should use an aloe vera gargle as often as desired. Take a small mouthful of the liquid, move it to the back of your throat without swallowing it, and then move it around the back of your throat by slowly exhaling.Once you have exhaled all of your air, either inhale again through your nose or spit out the gargle and then take in a new breath.
Just be sure that you don't ingest more than one tablespoon three times a day.

, If you have a severe sore throat, you can apply pure aloe vera gel to your throat without dilution or with minimal dilution simply to make it effective for gargling. A product like aloe vera juice can be very helpful for this type of full strength application.If you use small amounts, it should relieve some of your discomfort while not exceeding the recommended daily dosage.

, While aloe vera is safe to ingest in recommended amounts, it can cause some side effects. In particular, it is known to be a laxative. This means that if you swallow the aloe as you gargle with it, it may cause you to have loose stools or increased bowel movements.There needs to be more research done on the medical effects of aloe vera. Along with constipation, there is some evidence that it could have carcinogenic properties as well when ingested in large amounts."

, Inhaling steam can help you manage nasal congestion by exposing the nasal passages and throat to hot air. The hot air and moisture will break down the mucus in your throat and nasal passages, reducing the chances of the infection remaining in your body.


For better results, you can add eucalyptus oil or a tincture of benzoin for a more soothing effect.
A hot shower can also be good.

, It is better to eat six small frequent meals than three large meals, because large meals and hard-to-swallow foods can cause pain to the throat. Soft foods such as cereals, soup, and others will help avoid pain when swallowing because of its consistency.

, Ice cream, cold drinks, and popsicles can soothe your sore throat. Cold drinks create the feeling of relief in a sore throat. How they relieve pain is not yet known, but the mechanism may be psychological, as the temperature can mask the pain in the throat.

, Vitamin C boosts the immune system by improving the effectiveness of phagocytes, cells that kill foreign bodies by ingesting them. Be sure to get your daily dose of vitamin C by eating fruits and vegetables during every major meal.


Some fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C are: oranges, blackberries, broccoli, cranberries, kale, lemon, lime.

Understand the extent of what you can do with medicine.,
Try over the counter medicines.,
Seek out antibiotics if you have a bacterial infection.",How to Prevent a Sore Throat from Progressing to a Cold2," The main goal in treating a sore throat is to reduce the signs and symptoms of it. Antibiotics are not the first line of treatment for a sore throat caused by a cold, because they are ineffective against most viral infections.


Only when you have a prolonged infection, such as strep, should you seek out antibiotic treatment.
A sore throat is an indication of the body’s natural defenses working against infection.
The tonsils at the back of the throat trap foreign bodies and swell when large amounts are trapped in them.

, Over the counter medications can be used in order to reduce the signs and symptoms of the sore throat and let the body’s immune system take care of the infection. Reducing the symptoms of the sore throat can allow you to get better rest and fight off the infection more effectively.


Take simple painkillers to aid in the relief of pain related to the sore throat. Painkillers work by blocking and interfering with the pain signals going to the brain.

Common painkillers are ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen.



, If you have determined, through testing and a doctor's visit, that you have a bacterial infection, get antibiotics prescribed. Antibiotics can help the body fight off a bacterial infection that would otherwise be very hard to beat.


Do not use antibiotics that you have leftover from other illness, because they will be ineffective if your sore throat is not the result of a bacterial infection.
Most sore throats are viral, and cannot be treated with antibiotics.

Be aware of the common causes of sore throats.,
Get a physical examination.,
Request a throat swab.,
Have a complete blood count (CBC) done.,
Take an allergy test.",How to Prevent a Sore Throat from Progressing to a Cold3," Know that not all sore throats come from colds, and often you cannot prevent them from developing. If the sore throat is due to a viral infection, then you cannot stop its progress by treating it with antibiotics.

, Go to your doctor to find out what is causing your sore throat. Your doctor will use a lighted instrument to assess the status of the throat, along with the ears and nasal passages. Palpation of the neck is also done to evaluate presence of swollen lymph nodes. Breathing patterns are also checked through the use of a special instrument, the stethoscope.

, To find out if you have a bacterial infection, ask your doctor for a throat swab. Specimen samples are taken at the back of the throat using a sterile cotton swab. They are then brought to the laboratory for proper analysis and identification of streptococcal bacteria.


Results of the procedure are usually available within a few minutes after the collection of the specimen.
Positive results can denote a bacterial infection while a negative result may mean a viral infection.

, A blood sample can be obtained to measure the count of various kinds of blood cells. This can help determine what kind of blood cells are elevated, normal, or below average levels, and reveal whether the infection is due to bacteria or a virus.

, Sore throats can be caused by allergic reactions. Get an allergy panel done to see if the cause of your sore throat is allergies. Allergy cases are typically referred to a specialist for further evaluation and proper management.

Consult with your doctor if you get strep throat frequently.",How to Prevent Strep Throat," The main way to prevent strep throat is to avoid contact with someone you know is infected with strep throat. You should avoid any contact with that person, which means you should not touch them at all or share a close environment with them. You should also avoid touching anything that an infected person may have come into contact with. The objects could have the bacteria living on them and you might transmit it to yourself.


You should keep your distance while the infected individual completes the first 48 hours of antibiotics. After 48 hours of proper antibacterial treatment, you may resume casual contact because she is no longer contagious.
The American Academy of Family Practice has done research that state that in homes with one confirmed case, there is a 43% chance of a second family or household contact contracting the bacterial infection. Be extra careful if someone in your family had strep throat and avoid contact as much as possible.If you know someone sick with strep throat, encourage them to stay home, especially in the first few days when they are still contagious. If your kids or members of your family have it, you should keep them at home until you know they cannot infect anyone else (their fever has gone and they have been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours).You should avoid going out if you have strep throat as well. You don't want to accidentally infect others at work or in public.
If your children attend daycare, keep them away for a few days if a child at their daycare has strep throat.;
, Once you know an object has been touched by someone with strep throat, you need to make sure you wash it. Because of the highly contagious and hearty nature of this bacteria, every object that has been touched is at risk of transmitting the bacteria to another host. In order to prevent this from happening, wash all the items an infected person has touched. These items include clothing, bedding, dishes (especially cups), straws, silverware, and anything else that may have been contaminated through touch.Use boiling water and bleach on items to get rid of the bacteria. If you cannot use these methods on them, the objects should be replaced. Use color-safe bleach on objects that could be stripped of color if regular bleach is used.
For objects that cannot be removed and washed, such as door handles and counters, you can either use a rag soaked in bleach or an antibacterial spray to eliminate the bacteria.
Toothbrushes should be disposed of after 2 days of treatment with antibiotics.Never allow family members to share toothbrushes., Sharing may be caring in most cases, but if someone in your family has strep throat, don't let them share with others. Don't drink from the same glass or eat from the same plate as the person infected with strep throat.Sharing of soft objects, such as napkins, handkerchiefs, towels, bedding, or soft toys, should also be discouraged., You can prevent the transmission of strep throat by washing your hands frequently, especially when in an area with an infected person. Given how frequently people touch their faces, noses, and mouths, it is easy to see how it may be transmitted. Wash your hands often with water as warm as you can tolerate for a period of 15-30 seconds. Use a good amount of soap and wash all areas of your hands, including in between your fingers and around your wrists.


Longer or more aggressive hand washing has been linked with increased transmission of bacteria infections because the protective skin barrier of the hands is damaged at a microscopic level, which allows the bacteria to get into your system. So only wash for 15-30 seconds so you don't get rid of needed layers of skin.
If you discover that you have come into contact with an ill person, avoid touching your mouth or nose and immediately wash your hands. If that is not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer., If you don't have a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hands. This will help prevent people infected with strep throat from spreading germs by touching things., Your body requires rest to fight off an infection. People in your household infected with strep throat should definitely get adequate rest, but don't short your own sleep either. Getting enough sleep each night will help keep you strong and healthy., Consuming foods high in vitamins and nutrients can help strengthen your immune system. Eat a diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins. If you aren't feeling sick, this diet will help you stay that way. If you're not feeling well, it will help you recover., Although there is no documented research that these vitamins prevent strep throat specifically, vitamin C and D enhance your immune function, which boosts your immune system and helps you fight bacteria that invade your body.


If your immune system is strong, there is a chance that, when exposed to strep, you might make an army of antibodies against the strep sufficient to prevent you from infection instead getting sick.
Despite this increased immunity, you should not expose yourself unnecessarily to the bacteria and should still follow all precautions.Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. Other sources include kiwi, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe. Many beverages are also fortified with vitamin C.Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D. Fortified milk and juices will also help boost your intake. You can also stimulate your body to synthesize vitamin D by going outside into the sunshine (just wear sunscreen)., Zinc is an essential element for the cells in your immune system. In order to build up your immune system, you should ingest more zine every day. It will provide the cells in your immune system with much needed nutrients to function. Eat more zinc-rich foods, such as seafood, lean red meats, poultry, beans, and fortified breakfast cereals. You can also get a zinc supplement that you can take every day.


Although getting enough zinc is good for you, getting too much zinc can actually impede your immune system. Try to aid for 15-25 mg a day. Make sure you do not overuse a supplement when you are getting plenty of zinc from your diet., Vitamin A also helps fight infections. If you have a vitamin A deficiency, you are at an increased risk of getting an infections such as strep throat. Eat more vitamin A-rich foods, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, beef liver, cantaloupes, mangoes, black eyed peas, broccoli, and peppers.


You can get multivitamins and supplements that have vitamin A in them as well. You should have 650 mg per day if you are an adult male and 580 mg per day if you are an adult female., Prevention is essential for strep because it is highly contagious. It is spread from person to person by coming into contact with contaminated secretions, from shaking hands with someone who hasn't washed her hands to kissing your baby. What typically occurs is an infected person wipes her nose or mouth contaminated with the bacteria and then touches someone or something. The bacteria can survive on objects for between for several days, although it may survive on dry surfaces for up to 6 months.In some studies, the bacteria is very hearty. For example, it has survived in ice cream for 18 days and in macaroni salad for a week.Because the bacteria is so hearty and contagious, it can be spread even after treatment.

, The incubation period, or amount of time the bacteria takes to show symptoms, is between 1-3 days. This means that you may not feel unwell or know you're sick, but you may expose others unknowingly.


Without antibiotic treatment, an individual is infectious for the period of the infection, which is 7-10 days, as well as an additional week afterwards.With antibiotic treatment, the person is infectious for as little as 24 hours after beginning treatment., The most common symptoms of strep throat are a severe and painful throat, painful swallowing, and a fever greater than 100.4 degrees. You may also experience swollen throat glands or headaches. Stomach upset and vomiting may occur in younger children.If you look closely at your throat, you may also see the characteristic red and swollen tonsils with white shaggy clumps of pus, or exudates, on the tonsils.
Occasionally, strep throat can lead to scarlet fever, an inflammatory illness which has the same symptoms of strep throat with the addition of a non-raised, sandpaper like rash that may be anywhere on the body. The rash is not itchy. Before the rash appears, there may also be stomach pain or vomiting, especially in children.Sometimes, the enlarged painful tonsils sometimes have an abscess formation just adjacent to the tonsil, which require surgical drainage. Sometimes this can be performed in your doctor's office, although it may need surgical intervention or your doctor may decide to treat it with aggressive antibiotics.You should seek treatment if you have the white shaggy pus pockets on your tonsils and a fever. These are readily visible to even the untrained eye.
If you have a fever that has not gone away for 2-3 days and you have a bad sore throat, see your doctor to be tested for strep throat.

, Diagnosis is most often confirmed clinically, though you can typically guess what you have based on the characteristic white pus pockets on your tonsils. In recent years, rapid strep tests have made it easier for clinicians to diagnose strep throat definitively in the office setting, though typically the triad of fever, pus pockets, and severe sore throat in an ill-appearing individual is sufficient for diagnosis.


Other testing is available but usually unnecessary.Children will likely be tested using a rapid antigen test, which can detect antigens (substances that produce an immune response in your body) in your throat within minutes. Because children are more prone to complications from strep throat, your doctor will probably use the rapid test to diagnose first. If it is inconclusive, the doctor will order a throat culture, which takes a few days to process.There is also the option of a DNA test (called a NAAT or PCR test), which gives results within 24 hours.

, In the US, treatment with antibiotics for strep throat is common. Your physician will check you for strep throat and then prescribed you an antibiotic in the penicillin family, with the most common being Amoxicillin, although your doctor will prescribe different antibiotics if you are allergic to penicillin or Amoxicillin. These should be taken according to your doctor's directions.


Typically, you will begin to feel better within that 48 hour window. If not, you should seek further treatment from your healthcare provider as you may have an antibiotic resistant strain of strep bacteria or the beginnings of an abscess infection.You should always complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you begin to feel better. Failing to do so can cause the remaining bacteria, which are stronger than the ones killed by the antibiotics, to become resistant to drug treatment. This makes the condition harder to treat and cure., If you're getting strep throat frequently, or if your strep throat is severe or difficult to treat, talk to your doctor. She may recommend that you see an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist about having your tonsils removed. While this doesn't completely prevent the recurrence of strep throat, it can help, especially in children.Severe strep throat shows signs such as a fever of at least 101F (38C), swollen or painful lymph nodes in the neck, and/or white pus on the tonsils.

Focus on the causes behind the stress, rather than the symptoms of stress.,
Minimize circumstances that you identify as stressors.,
Provide a framework of plainly defined rules and boundaries.,
Create an environment that promotes positivity and acceptance.,

Lead by example.,
Open communication lines through stories.,
Talk with the child and listen closely to what they have to say.",How to Reduce Stress in Children," Understand that children can incur stress over any of a number of things that you, as an adult, may not consider stressful. Therefore, it is important to know what to look for in order to help reduce children's stress:


Physical symptoms include stomachaches, bedwetting, respiratory infection, racing heartbeat, excessive sleepiness and increased anxiety.
Behavioral changes may include anything that is outside of the child's character. For example, if the child is normally quiet and shy, then acting out and making a scene would be outside of that child's character and could be a sign of stress. Conversely, an extroverted child may become detached and withdrawn in response to stress.;
, This can reduce stress by helping children learn how to recognize how stress is affecting them so that they can employ coping methods to counter it. No matter the child's age, being able to identify emotions like sadness, fear, apprehension and anxiety is the first step toward reducing stress.

, When children display physical and behavioral signs of stress, the most effective way to reduce children's stress is to address the stress itself, rather than attempt to correct the symptoms. For example, if a child becomes especially argumentative, you should avoid harsh reprimands in favor of finding the underlying root of the problem.

, If you notice that certain conditions are likely to cause stress in children, do what you can to reduce the occurrence of those conditions.

, Back those up with explicitly stated consequences. Children rely on predictability and routine, and a great way to reduce children's stress is to be very clear about policies and procedures.

, Children should be encouraged to be their most authentic selves, express themselves freely and engage in open inquiry in regards to their feelings. Provide verbal and physical reassurance that the children are accepted and valued.

, Make sure children get plenty of exercise and subscribe to a healthy diet in order to counteract some of the negative effects of stress in children.

, When you employ techniques to reduce stress in your own life, you provide a frame of reference for the children who look up to you. The best way to teach coping skills to children is to actively use them yourself.

, Children do not have the self-awareness that adults have, nor do they necessarily have the ability to articulate what they are feeling. When you engage children in story-time, you enable them to relate to complex concepts by communicating on their level. To reduce stress, use therapeutic books with characters children can connect with.

, Try to come up with suggestions to how they can cope with their stress. But...avoid yelling at them or becoming stressed out yourself! It will make the person feel worse.

To prevent laryngitis, avoid contact with other people who have a cold.If someone at your work or school is sick, stay away from them as symptoms persist.
Never share utensils or a drink with someone suffering from a cold.;
, Viruses and bacteria are also spread by contact with hands. Frequent hand washing can keep bacteria away, lessening your likelihood of getting a cold. Wash your hands throughout the day, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. If someone you work in close proximity with is sick, wash your hands more often.Apply soap on your hands and work it into a lather. Make sure to scrub all of your hands, including between your fingers, the backs of your hands, and under your fingernails.Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Then, dry your hands with a clean, dry towel.

, Even if you're not sick, you can wind up with laryngitis. You can end up with laryngitis due to exposure to substances that irritate the throat. Manage your exposure to anything that causes a sore throat or coughing to prevent laryngitis.Cigarette smoke can irritate the throat. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about quitting. If you don't smoke, make sure you stay away from secondhand smoke.
If you're regularly exposed to harsh chemicals or allergens at work or home, make sure to wear a face mask.
Stomach acid can also irritate the throat. If you notice you're experiencing symptoms of acid reflux, take medication right away to manage symptoms.

, Alcohol can easily dry out the throat, making you vulnerable to laryngitis. Drinking in excess should be avoided if you're trying to prevent laryngitis.If you do drink, stick to one to two drinks a day. Avoid drinking for days on end.
If you're trying to avoid laryngitis in preparation for something like a speaking event, it's a good idea to refrain from drinking altogether in the days leading up to the event.

, Laryngitis can also be caused by strain to the vocal chords. Talking or singing loudly for days on end can cause laryngitis. Work on preventing your voice from becoming strained if you want to prevent laryngitis.Do not talk or sing too loud. Use a microphone if you need to project your voice.
Avoid events where there will be yelling. If you go to, say, a sports match, try not to participate in things like loud screaming and cheering.

, Caffeine can also dry out your throat, increasing your risk of laryngitis. If you want to prevent laryngitis, do not over do it on substances like coffee and soda. Stick to one or two caffeinated beverages each day to protect yourself from laryngitis., In general, a salt water solution is better for your throat than most oral mouthwashes. If you do use mouthwash, make sure to choose a brand that does not use alcohol or other irritating chemicals.If you're using mouthwash to counteract persistent bad breath, talk to your doctor or dentist. Bad breath may have underlying causes.

, Spicy foods can trigger acid reflux, causing stomach acid to travel to the throat. This can irritate the throat, causing laryngitis. Limit your consumption of spicy foods, or any other foods that cause symptoms of heartburn and acid reflux., A diet that encourages throat health can help prevent laryngitis. Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables contain many vital nutrients for throat health.Work on choosing whole grains over white breads and pastas. You should also opt for brown rice over white rice.
Make sure to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Strive to include a serving of fruits and vegetables in each meal you consume.

, Even if you work hard to prevent a respiratory infection, you can still end up with laryngitis. Symptoms include hoarseness, a weak voice, sore throat, or a tickling sensation in your throat. If you notice these symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor.Make sure you have all the information your doctor will need on hand. Jot down when your symptoms started and any risk factors, such as a recent cold or flu, that may have caused laryngitis. You should also have a list of any medications you're currently taking.
Your doctor will provide a basic physical exam and probably look at your throat. They will then ask questions about your symptoms and general lifestyle to asses the best treatment plan for you.

, If medication is required, laryngitis is generally treated with either antibiotics or corticosteroids. If you are prescribed a medication, take it exactly as instructed. Ask your doctor any questions you have before leaving the office.Antibiotics are usually prescribed for bacterial laryngitis. Make sure you take all your antibiotics, even after symptoms have passed, as your doctor instructs.
Corticosteroids are usually only used for intense symptoms of laryngitis. They also may be used if you need to clear up symptoms quickly in order to give a speech, sing, or do something else with your voice.

, Do not use your voice that often when recovering from laryngitis. Do not talk more than you have to, and avoid talking loudly. Make use of a microphone or megaphone when speaking in front of groups., A dry throat can make symptoms of laryngitis worse, so take steps to keep your throat moist. This will help laryngitis resolve faster.Drink plenty of fluids during the day, especially water.
Gargle with salt water, suck on lozenges, or chew gum during the day.
Try using a humidifier in your bedroom. You can also try breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water.

, You may be inclined to whisper after contracting laryngitis; however, whispering actually puts more strain on your voice than talking as you normally would. If you need to talk, simply talk in your normal voice. Do not whisper."

You may experience pain or difficulty swallowing.;
, In addition to a severe sore throat that starts quick, your throat tonsils may look red and swollen, sometimes with white patches or pus. You may also have tiny red spots on the area at the back of the roof of the mouth., The infection will also cause the lymph glands in your neck to swell. If you feel around your neck, you’ll likely notice the swelling, which will also be tender to the touch.Pay particular attention to the glands in the front of your neck, under your jaw at either side of your airway.

, Strep throat or other throat infections can cause bad breath.Your infected tonsils will begin to secrete dead white blood cells, which give off a particular protein-like odor.

, Fever and chills are two more distinctive symptoms of strep throat. The fever is usually highest on the second day of the infection as your body responds.Normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Fluctuations greater than one or two degrees Fahrenheit (one-half to one degree Celsius) are a sign that you might have an infection.
If you have a fever over 101°F (38.3°C) or a fever lasting more than 48 hours, call your healthcare provider., Anytime your immune system responds vigorously to an infection, you may also experience generally flu-like symptoms. These symptoms may include:Rash, usually on the chest with the look and feeling of sandpaper
Headache
Fatigue
Stomach ache, nausea, or vomiting (especially in children)

, Ultimately, your doctor will have to diagnose whether or not your illness is strep throat or caused by something else. Your body will begin clearing most viral infections that can cause similar symptoms within a day or two (not completely but a noticeable difference), so you should especially see your physician if symptoms persist at the same severity for more than 48 hours.

, OTC painkillers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help reduce pain and fever.Take these medicines with food if possible, and do not exceed the manufacturer’s daily dosage.


Avoid using aspirin to alleviate strep throat symptoms in children and teenagers due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome, which can cause life-threatening swelling in the liver and brain., Salt water can also help alleviate strep throat pain. Mix about ¼ teaspoon of salt into a tall glass of warm water. Take the salt water in the back of your mouth, tilt your head back, and gargle for thirty seconds. Spit the salt water out after the back of your throat is coated.Repeat several times a day as needed.
For younger children, ensure that they understand not to swallow the salt water., Many people can become dehydrated when they have strep throat because the painful swallowing stops them from drinking. However, keeping your throat lubricated will actually help reduce pain associated with swallowing.Though it may be unpleasant at first, drink plenty of water.


Some people may find warm liquids more soothing than cold water. You may also want to try warm (not hot) tea with lemon or honey.

, Sleeping is one of the best steps you can take at home to help your immune system battle an infection. Stay home from work or school and get lots of rest.Since strep throat is highly contagious, you should also stay home to help avoid spreading the infection to peers.

, Your throat drying out overnight can lead to an especially painful sore throat first thing in the morning. A humidifier will add more moisture to the air while you sleep (or even as you’re resting at home during the day), helping to reduce the pain of your strep throat.Ensure that you clean a humidifier daily during use since they’re ideal environments for bacteria and mold., Throat lozenges and sprays designed to help with sore throat symptoms can also help reduce sore throat pain and painful swallowing. These products can help coat the throat to reduce irritation or slightly numb your throat to alleviate symptoms. Use as directed.


Do not give lozenges to children under age 4, as they are at risk for choking.

, Hard, dry foods that can scrape and irritate your throat will be more painful to swallow. Soups, applesauce, yogurt, and mashed potatoes are just a few foods that might be easier on your throat to swallow.You should also avoid spicy foods until your symptoms subside., Irritants to your throat—especially smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke—can cause additional throat pain.Other irritants you should avoid while you have strep throat include paint fumes and fumes from cleaning products.

, If symptoms persist, then you should see your doctor because strep throat can spread, leading to the bacterial infection in other parts of the body or other complications of your heart, kidneys, or joints. Your doctor will be able to perform a quick swab of your throat to determine your diagnosis, or he or she may also have a lab do a culture of a swab sample.If the test comes back positive, then your doctor will likely prescribe a course of antibiotics.

, Your physician will likely prescribe a ten-day course of antibiotics (though this can vary based on the antibiotic). Common antibiotics for strep throat include penicillin or amoxicillin unless you have an allergy to them, in which case he or she will likely prescribe cephalexin or azithromycin.When taking antibiotics:Take as directed until the prescription is gone. Skipping doses or stopping because you feel better can increase the chances of recurrence, as well as helping to produce antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
See your doctor again immediately if you experience an allergic reaction to the antibiotic, with symptoms such as hives, vomiting, swelling, or trouble breathing, or if your symptoms have not started to improve within forty-eight hours of beginning your course of antibiotics.
Do not return to work or school for at least twenty-four hours. You will still be contagious until you’ve been on the antibiotic for at least a full day.

, As with most infections, washing your hands well and often is one of the best preventative measures you can take.This goes double if you have strep throat and want to ensure that you do not spread it to those around you.

, Any time you cough or sneeze while battling a strep throat infection, you expel the bacteria, potentially spreading it to those around you. Make sure you take extra steps to cover your mouth whenever you cough or sneeze. Using your sleeve rather than your hands helps reduce the spread of germs even more, but if you must use your hands, ensure that you wash them immediately after., Eating utensils, cups, and anything else that goes near your mouth will have an even higher risk of potentially spreading strep throat to others. Avoid sharing these items and wash them in hot, soapy water to kill the bacteria.After you finish two days of antibiotics, throw away and get a new toothbrush to prevent reinfecting yourself.
A dishwasher works fine to eliminate the bacteria when it comes to dishes and utensils."

Discuss any treatment options the doctor suggests so that you can weigh the benefits and drawbacks of them for your child. Some of the treatment options your child’s pediatrician may consider are:Keeping a migraine diary.
Taking specific anti-migraine medications such as sumatriptan (Imigran).
Using prescription anti-nausea (emetic), anti-inflammatory, sedatives, and/or pain relief medications such as pizotifen.
Trying preventative drugs including anti-convulsants, anti-depressants, antihistamines, and/or medications that relax blood vessels, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.

Be aware of the causes of hives.,
See your pediatrician if your child has hives.,
Get medical tests.,
Treat underlying conditions.,
Avoid what triggers your child’s hives.",How to Treat Hives in Children1," If your child develops hives, they may present on either a localized part of her body or over her entire body. Learning about the presentation of hives on your child’s body may help you identify their cause.Localized hives appear on one part of the body and are usually caused by direct skin contact with plants, pollen, food, or pet saliva and fur.Widespread hives appear all over the body. They may be a reaction to a viral infection or an allergic reaction to a food, drug, or insect bite.;
, There are many different reasons a child may develop hives. Whether the hives are localized or widespread on your child’s, knowing what can cause hives may help you effectively treat the hives at home or decide to visit the pediatrician.Foods such as shellfish, nuts, milk, and fruit may cause hives.Hives from food usually go away within six hours of ingestion.Medications such as penicillin or allergy shots may cause hives.Contact with pets or animals may cause hives.Exposure to pollen from flowering plants may cause hives.Stings/bites from insects such as bees and mosquitoes may cause hives.Anxiety or stress may cause a child to develop hives.Exposure to extreme temperatures or the sun may spur a case of hives.Contact with chemicals, including laundry detergent or perfumed soaps, may cause hives.Viral infections like the common cold, infectious mononucleosis and hepatitisBacterial infections such as urinary tract infections and strep throat, See your pediatrician if your child has hives and you are unsure of the cause, the hives don’t disappear within a week, has recently started a new medication or food, has been stung by an insect, or your child becomes very uncomfortable. The doctor may prescribe oral medications, steroid creams, or other treatments to ease the hives.It’s important to see your doctor if you are unsure of the cause of the hives. This can minimize the risk of treating the hives with something that may harm your child or is unnecessary.See the doctor if your child’s hives are still severe after a second dose of antihistamines.If your child experiences any of the symptoms of anaphylactic shock, including facial or throat swelling, coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or feeling dizzy or fainting, take them to the emergency room or call 911 immediately., If your doctor can’t determine the underlying cause of your child’s hives, she may use different tests to diagnose your child’s condition. This will not only give you a cause, but can also help form the best treatment plan for your child’s hives.Your child’s doctor may prescribe blood tests to identify underlying causes.Your child’s doctor may prescribe allergy tests to identify specific allergens your child has., If your doctor determines that your child’s hives are caused by an underlying condition, she may treat this to help alleviate the welts and itching. Some studies have shown that treating underlying conditions can be more effective at healing hives than addressing the hives.For example, if your child has a thyroid issue, your doctor may treat that first and see how it helps the hives.If your doctor determines your child has a specific allergy, she will likely ask you to keep the allergen from contacting your child.

, This skin condition can occur because of an allergen or a specific irritant. Knowing what triggers your child’s hives can help you avoid the irritant and help relieve and prevent her hives.The trigger could be an allergen, medication, food allergy, cosmetic, environmental factor, insect bite, infection, or harsh soap or detergent.If you suspect a specific trigger, try to limit exposure to it and see if it relieves your child’s symptoms.Certain external factors can worsen hives including sun exposure, stress, sweat, temperature changes.Use mild or “hypoallergenic” soaps and laundry detergents. These contain fewer harmful chemicals that can irritate your child’s skin. Any product marked “hypoallergenic” has been tested for sensitive skin and will not irritate your child’s skin."

Wash off the allergen for localized hives.,
Draw a cool bath to reduce the itching and redness.,
Apply calamine lotion or anti-itch cream.,
Apply a cold compress to relieve itching and inflammation.,
Keep your child from scratching.,
Protect your child’s skin.",How to Treat Hives in Children2," If your child’s hives are localized on one area of their body, wash the allergen off with soap and water. This should help relieve the hives and may keep them from getting worse because the allergen is lingering on the skin.You don’t need to purchase any special soap, using any soap will work to remove the allergen., A cool bath can soothe irritated skin and help decrease inflammation. It is most helpful when the hives are all over your child's body. You may want to consider adding a colloidal oatmeal preparation to help further soothe your child’s skin.Sprinkle water with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal, all of which can help calm your child’s skin.Let your child stay in the bathtub for only 10-15 minutes so they don’t get a chill., Applying a calamine lotion or non-prescription anti-itch cream can relieve hives, itching, and inflammation. You can purchase anti-itch cream at grocery and drug stores both in-store and online.A nonprescription anti-itch, or hydrocortisone, cream, can help relieve itching. Make sure to purchase a cream with at least 1% hydrocortisone.
Apply the cream once a day after your child’s bath to the affected area., The itching and inflammation from hives come from histamine in your blood. Cold packs or compresses can help relieve itching and inflammation associated with hives by constricting blood flow and cooling the skin.Histamine is produced when an allergen enters in the body. It causes all allergic reactions, including itching and inflammation.
You can place a cold compress on your rashes intermittently for 10 to 15 minutes, once every 2 hours or as needed., Help your child avoid scratching as much as possible. Scratching the can spread allergen, exacerbate symptoms, or cause other problems, including a skin infection., You can help prevent and relieve hives by protecting your child’s skin. Clothing, bandages, and even bug spray may offer some protection and help relieve symptoms.


Wear cool, loose, smooth textured clothing such as cotton or merino wool to keep your child from scratching and prevent excess sweating, which can exacerbate hives.Have your child wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to keep her from scratching and protect it from external irritants.If your child will be exposed to insects, you can also apply bug repellant to areas that do not have hives. This may prevent insects from getting too close to your child’s skin and causing further allergic reactions.

Give your child an antihistamine.,
Take histamine (H-2) blockers.,
Use prescription corticosteroids.,
Have an asthma drug injected.,
Combine asthma drugs and antihistamines.,
Consider immune system suppressants.",How to Treat Hives in Children3," If your child has hives all over her body, give her an antihistamine. These drugs can block the histamine that causes allergic reactions and help relieve itching and skin inflammation.Follow the recommended dose for your child’s age and weight. If you’re unsure of dosing, check with your child’s doctor.Common antihistamines include cetirizine,chlorpheniramine,and diphenhydramine.These drugs often have sedative effects so make sure to watch your child for safety., Your child’s doctor may suggest taking histamine, or H-2, blockers to help relieve the hives. Your child may receive an injection or oral dosage of these medications.Examples of histamine blockers are cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), nizatidine (Axid), and famotidine (Pepcid).Side effects from these drugs may include digestive problems or headaches., Your doctor may prescribe either a stronger topical or oral corticosteroid such as prednisone if other treatments don’t ease your child’s hives. Make sure to follow your doctor’s directions on taking these medications as they can weaken your child’s immune system.Oral steroids are only used for a short time because they can have serious side effects when used long term., Several studies have demonstrated that injections of the asthma drug omalizumab may help relieve hives. This drug comes with the benefit that it has no side effects.This treatment costs more than other options and is generally not covered by insurance., Your doctor may prescribe your child a course of asthma medication with antihistamines. This treatment may help relieve your child’s hives.Your doctor may prescribe the asthma drugs montelukast (Singulair) or zafirlukast (Accolate) with an prescription or over the counter antihistamine.This treatment can cause behavior and mood changes., If your child’s hives are chronic and don’t respond to other treatments, your doctor may suggest drugs that affect the immune system. These drugs can help relieve acute and chronic hives.Cyclosporine limits the immune system’s response to hives and can help provide relief of your child’s hives. However, it comes with side effects that range from headaches to nausea and, in some cases, reduced kidney function.Tacrolimus also reduces the immune system’s reaction that causes hives. It comes with similar side effects to cyclosporine.Mycophenolate suppresses the immune system while improving the signs and symptoms of hives."

Consult with your child's pediatrician before treating suspected eczema.,
Give your child a daily bath.,
Consider trying ""bleach baths."",
Apply a moisturizer after each bath.,
Consider applying moist wraps to affected areas.,
Limit your child's scratching.,
Dress your child in clothing that limits irritation.,
Prevent or moderate future flare-ups.",How to Treat Eczema in Children1," The cause of eczema's can be difficult to determine, and it can be difficult to diagnose. Relying on the expertise of medical professionals is the best way to ensure that your child is receiving the best care for his condition.There is no test that can confirm the existence of eczema, so a physical examination and the consideration of hereditary and environmental factors are usually utilized to determine its presence.
Your child's pediatrician may refer you to an allergist. Eczema isn't an allergy, but allergies can be a trigger for outbreaks. You may also be referred to a dermatologist for examination and care recommendations.;
, This routine may help to reduce bacteria that can cause infections and hydrate the skin if done properly. Avoid hot water and overly-long baths, however, both of which can dry the skin. (Dry skin can both trigger eczema and exacerbate outbreaks.) Use lukewarm water and allow the child to soak for only about ten minutes.Wash the child with a mild, non-drying, gentle cleanser. Consider using an emollient, or skin-softening body wash, without perfumes or dyes if the child has especially bad eczema. Wash gently and avoid harsh scrubbing that can make the condition worse.
Dove, Cetaphil, and Aveeno are excellent choices for children.
Pat the child dry afterwards. Do not scrub the child with a towel.

, While it may sound extreme, some studies indicate that bleach baths can reduce the symptoms of eczema in older children. Also, even more so than regular baths, they can help reduce infection-causing bacteria.The bleach needs to be extremely diluted, however. You should add no more than 1/4 cup (60 ml) of bleach to a half-tub of warm water.
Bleach baths are usually used only once or twice a week.
You should always consult with your doctor to determine whether or not the treatment is safe for your child based on his or her age and overall health.
Try to keep the bleach water out of the child's eyes.

, This should be done after every bath, regardless of whether or not your child is presently suffering from a flare-up. The product should be applied as soon as you finish towel-drying the child, in order to lock in the moisture from the bath.Add thick layers of moisturizer. You want to build up an actual moisture barrier to keep it from escaping the skin. Ask your doctor for recommendations on the best moisturizers for your child.
Children with extreme eczema may benefit more from a moisturizing ointment than a cream. Ointments contain more oil, which locks in moisture, while lotions are mostly water that does not provide the same moisture seal. Creams tend to fall in between.
Moisturizing lotions, therefore, are often ineffective for kids with eczema. Moreover, many lotions contain perfumes that can actually inflame the skin further.

, A cool compress placed on an inflamed area can provide some temporary relief. It may also be applied as a cool, moist bandage wrap. Leave the compress or wrap on only for a short period of time.On the subject of wraps, dry bandages are often used with emollients and a steroid cream. Wet bandages may feel more soothing and can also be used as long as they are medicated with a topical cream. They can also help the steroid cream better penetrate the skin. This is a short-term treatment to use once flare-ups occur and should not extend past one or two weeks. You should consult with your doctor before determining whether or not the treatment is appropriate.

, It may offer relief for a few seconds, but scratching only makes the condition worse. Monitor your child and stop her from scratching excessively.Keep your child's fingernails trimmed short so that when she does scratch, it does not do much damage.
If necessary, place cotton gloves or mittens on your child's hands at night to limit scratching while asleep.

, Soft, breathable, loose-fitting fabrics like cotton, laundered in mild, fragrance free soaps (without scented fabric softeners or dryer sheets) are less likely to exacerbate eczema symptoms.You may also want to try so-called ""eczema clothing"" to prevent irritation. There are products on the market today that may improve a child's eczema symptoms by removing the ability to scratch and itch the affected area. Children can struggle with sleeping due to irritation and scratching, so improving their quality of sleep can lead to a better mood and general management of their eczema.
Eczema clothing shouldn't replace the medicines, creams, or any other medication, but should aid the treatments being used.

, There are some environmental factors that have been known to trigger flare-ups:Milk, eggs, peanut butter, and fish have all been identified as potential trigger foods. Remember, eczema is not an allergy, but it may be exacerbated by them.
Dust, dander, and other allergens may also be triggers. Discuss these possibilities with an allergist or your child's physician.
Tight clothes or clothes made with rough fibers, like wool, can irritate the skin and cause a reaction.
Low humidity can also trigger an outbreak. Use a humidifier in your child's room to keep the skin from drying out.
Keep up the bathing and moisturizing routines, even when there are no breakout spots.

Use hydrocortisone cream for flare-ups.,
Give your child an over-the-counter antihistamine.,
Ask your child's doctor for a prescription steroid.,
Try a non-steroid prescription cream.,
Talk to the doctor about Cyclosporine in severe cases.,
Ask the doctor for an antibiotic if an infection is present.,
Consult with the doctor about phototherapy treatment.",How to Treat Eczema in Children2," You can purchase 1% hydrocortisone cream or ointment over the counter. Apply the cream directly to the inflamed skin after the child gets out of the bath and before applying a moisturizing cream.Always have a doctor diagnose your child with eczema and suggest proper treatments before providing medications yourself.
Note that hydrocortisone creams should always be the option of choice for eczema on the face. Prescription creams are often too potent to use on sensitive skin, so you should not use them around the face area until directly told otherwise by the doctor. Be careful when using topical steroids as they can thin the skin when used too frequently, especially on thinner areas of the skin like the face or groin, While antihistamines are generally used to treat allergies, they can also help with the itchiness associated with eczema.Perhaps even more important than possible anti-itch properties, antihistamines tend to cause drowsiness, which can be a godsend at night for an itchy, sleepless child (and his/her parents).
Again, talk to your child's physician first.

, When over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream is ineffective, the next step is to apply a stronger steroid cream or ointment. These products do require a prescription, though.A steroid cream or ointment should be applied directly to the inflamed skin for as long as the doctor instructs. Usually, this application occurs right after a bath but before the application of a moisturizer.
You may need to apply it twice a day. Your doctor will usually recommend using the topical steroid for no more than two weeks at a time. Always follow your doctor's recommendations on how to use prescription medications.
In severe cases, the doctor may also prescribe an oral steroid. Most children will not need oral steroids, and the treatment is not usually used in young kids. Some older children may need an oral steroid if their skin no longer improves with the use of topical treatment.

, The doctor may prescribe a topical immunomodulator such as a calcineurin inhibitor. These are immunosuppressive drugs that lower the immune system's ability to respond, thus dulling the reaction your child's skin has to certain eczema triggers.These treatments are rarely prescribed to children under the age of two, though, and are only used in cases when other treatments are not effective.
Again, apply these as instructed after a bath and before applying moisturizer, unless otherwise directed.

, Cyclosporine is a strong oral immunosuppressant sometimes used for eczema patients who do not respond to topical treatment.Cyclosporine is often used in organ transplant patients. Its possible side effects include a significantly increased risk of infections.
This treatment is usually used as a last resort, even in adults, and is rarely used for children. Nonetheless, if you have an older child whose symptoms are bad enough, the doctor may be willing to consider it.

, You may not be able to prevent your child from scratching, and excessive scratching may cause the area to get cut. Cuts often lead to infections. If this happens, it is important that you talk with your child's doctor about getting an appropriate antibiotic.Signs of infection can include persistent fever, warmth in the eczema-affected area, and atypical sores in the affected area.
An area that is just not improving with usual treatment may have an underlying infection.

, In phototherapy, ultraviolet light is applied directly to the child's skin, in the hope of reducing the risk of infection and improving the eczema symptoms.These treatments can bring relief to sufferers with severe eczema, but they should only be applied under dermatological supervision.

Suck on a throat lozenge.,
Drink hot tea.,
Chew ice chips.,
See your doctor.,
Take an antibiotic.",How to Reduce Uvula Swelling1," The warm water can feel soothing, and the salt can draw out the inflammation in your uvula. Don’t make the water hot – this can burn your throat and cause more damage. Add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons of table salt to 8 ounces of warm water and mix it together until the salt dissolves.You can gargle with warm salt water up to three times a day, just be sure not to swallow the salt water. Too much salt in your body can cause other issues.;
, You can use any kind you like, but if you’re feeling really uncomfortable or having a hard time swallowing, the type of lozenge that has numbing effects might be best.You can look for sugar-free throat lozenges in stores - it's usually pretty clearly marked on the front of the bag or box if lozenges are sugar-free. These are great if you're feeling ill but have other health concerns like diabetes.

, The hot liquid can feel soothing on your throat. If you add a bit of honey to it, it can actually coat your throat a little bit, making it easier to swallow.Herbal tea is especially good for healing sore throats. Chamomile tea with a bit of honey will work well to relieve some of your pain.
You can also try a homemade cinnamon tea for soothing your throat. Mix 10 grams each of slippery elm bark and marshmallow root, 8 grams of dried cinnamon chips, 5 grams of dried orange peel, and 3 whole cloves in 3 cups (24 ounces) of water and simmer it for 20 minutes. Strain off the herbs and add a bit of honey if you like. You should drink all of the tea within 36 hours., The ice can decrease the swelling in your uvula a little bit. And the cold in your throat can help it feel a little bit numb and make it easier to swallow., A swollen uvula can have a lot causes – it might be from allergies, or a bacterial infection, or something more serious. See your doctor and tell them about your full list of symptoms. They can prescribe medicine to ease your symptoms and treat the underlying cause. Your doctor might need to take a swab of your throat to fully diagnose what’s causing your swollen uvula. Relax your throat as much as possible – try not to tense up at all – and it should be relatively easy to get through.

, Your doctor might prescribe an antibiotic to you if your swollen uvula is the result of an infection. Make sure you follow the directions for the prescription exactly. You have to take antibiotics at exactly the same time each day for the full amount of time recommended to get rid of the infection entirely."

Check for difficulty swallowing.,
Notice if there’s choking or gagging.,
Look for drooling.,
Take your temperature.,
Look for a redness or swelling.",How to Reduce Uvula Swelling2," If you’re having a hard time swallowing, whether it’s food, liquid, or saliva, your uvula might be swollen. Try a few practice swallows to make sure you’re having a hard time and it wasn’t just a larger-than-normal piece of food or too-big drink of something.If you're having a hard time swallowing and breathing, contact your doctor immediately.

, If your uvula is swollen, you might find yourself choking or gagging even when there isn’t anything in your throat. Because your uvula hangs down in the back of your throat, any swelling in it can make you feel like you’re gagging., This is an especially important symptom to look out for in small kids, who might not be able to tell you how they’re feeling. If you notice that they are drooling more than usual, they might have a swollen uvula., A swollen uvula is usually caused by a bacterial infection, and those infections usually come with a fever. If you’re having a hard time swallowing and you’re choking or gagging, take your temperature to see if you have a fever. Normal temperatures vary from person to person, but anything more than a degree or two above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (or 37 degrees celsius) is a fever.If you have a fever, see your doctor immediately. A fever can indicate something much more serious is wrong, and fevers - even slight ones - in children can be very dangerous.

, If you suspect you might have a swollen uvula, you’ll have to check it in the mirror. Stand in front of a mirror that’s high enough for you to see your whole face or hold a hand mirror up. Open your mouth as wide as you can and look at your uvula – the drop shaped piece of skin in the back of your throat. If it looks red or swollen, you should see a doctor."
"
Avoid alcohol.,
Stop smoking.,
Take allergy medication.",How to Reduce Uvula Swelling3," Drinking too much alcohol can cause your uvula to swell. If you notice that it swells and then goes away on its own, try reducing your alcohol intake.If that doesn’t work, and your uvula continues to swell, see a doctor.

, Cigarette and cigar smoke is an irritant, and if you’re getting a lot in your throat, it can cause your uvula to swell. If you’ve having problems with a swollen uvula, quit smoking., Because a swollen uvula can be the sign of an allergic reaction, make sure you take any allergy medication you’re supposed to be taking. If you’ve never been diagnosed with an allergy but notice your uvula swells when you eat a certain food, see your doctor immediately. Any food allergy reaction that causes swelling in your throat should be treated right away since it can affect your ability to breathe."

Praise the child for staying dry. Never shame or punish them for wetting their bed. Consider getting a calendar and noting every dry night. The child is then rewarded for an agreed upon number of dry nights. If he has a relapse, you simply restart the count. This is always done in a matter of fact fashion. Your child is absolutely not doing this on purpose, and introducing shame and hurt into this situation certainly does not hasten the resolution process nor does it enhance the parent-child relationship.
Confide in the child the fact that you were also a bed wetter, if in fact you were. Explain that it might be hereditary, so that it will make him feel less guilty and less ashamed of himself.

, If you feel the problem is large enough and the person in question is over 5 years old, ask your doctor about apo-desmopressin. This is a drug that reduces the amount of urine produced. Find out all you can about this and its side effects. Desmopressin is a potent hormone that prevents the kidney from making urine. Enuresis typically recurs when Desmopressin is stopped. Desmopressin is primarily useful when your child must remain dry for a short period of time - class trip, camping trip, overnight stay with friends, etc.

Talk to your doctor about putting your child on a course of antibiotics.,
Talk to your doctor about giving the child aminosalicylates (5-ASA).,
Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for corticosteroids.,
Talk to your doctor about allowing the child to take the appropriate kind of painkillers.",How to Treat Children with Ulcerative Colitis1," Antibiotics are used for treating infections that aggravate the inflammation in the intestinal linings. The medications include Metronidazole and Ciprofloxacin. Upon proper laboratory tests, the cause of infection can be determined and the doctor can prescribe the proper antibiotic.


If the cause of the infection is anaerobic bacteria (single-celled bacteria that thrive in environments with less oxygen), then Metronidazole will be prescribed. Metronidazole works by interfering with the bacterial and protozoal cells’ DNA. This prevents the bacteria and protozoa from forming new DNA and eventually kills them. The recommended dose for children is 35 to 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily, which is given in 3 doses orally, for 10 days.Ciprofloxacin treats a wide array of infections caused by bacteria. This includes bacteria that causes inflammation in the intestines. Ciprofloxacin works by inhibiting the DNA replication of the bacteria. Prolonged inhibition leads to the death of the cells of the bacteria. For children, the recommended dose is 10 to 20 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for one to two weeks.;
, This medication works on the lining of the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting the production of inflammatory chemicals such as cytokines, therefore preventing and decreasing the occurrence of inflammation. It is also used as maintenance to prevent relapse of the disease. The most common prescribed aminosalicylate is sulfasalazine.


For children 6 years old and above, the recommended dose is 40 to 60 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, in 3 to 6 divided doses., The medication suppresses the immune system response that causes the development of inflammation in ulcerative colitis. Generally, corticosteroids are safe during pregnancy.


The most common prescribed corticosteroid is prednisone. The recommended oral dose for children in order to suppress inflammation is 0.05 to 2 mg/kg/day divided 1 to 4 times., Painkillers are drugs of choice to provide relief from abdominal cramps. The medication acts by blocking the pain signal to impede interpretation of the brain, thus the pain is not felt by a person. Painkillers are classified as:


Simple Painkillers or Aspirin drugs. It can be purchased over the counter and can alleviate certain pains. It includes paracetamol and ibuprofen. Simple pain killers are usually safe during pregnancy. For children, the dosage of a simple painkiller is usually 10-15 mg/kg of oral tablets or liquid suspension every 4 to 6 hours.Stronger Painkillers or Narcotic drugs. The medication is recommended only if other kind of painkillers do not achieve the goal of eliminating the pain sensation felt by the individual. There are different types of strong painkillers that are available in the market today. It is of great importance to take safety measures or seek medical advice prior to intake of certain drugs due to its possible effects.
Examples of these drugs are codeine and tramadol. Dosage of stronger painkillers varies. Oral tramadol usual dosage for children is 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 hours.For codeine, the recommended oral dose for children 1 year or older is 0.5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours."

Add soluble fiber to your child’s diet.,
Avoid giving your child caffeine.,
Don’t serve your child fatty foods.,
Avoid giving your child foods that contain artificial sweeteners.,
Avoid smoking near your child.",How to Treat Children with Ulcerative Colitis2," Diarrhea in ulcerative colitis happens when there is too much water in the colon because the stomach or small intestine secretes more fluid, or the undigested, liquid food passes quickly through the small intestine and colon and enough water is not absorbed from it.


Eating foods rich in soluble fiber can actually help absorb excess fluid in the bowel and act to firm up a loose stool. Just think of it as a sponge effect. Include foods rich in soluble fiber at least once in each major meal.Foods that are high in fiber include apples, beans, berries, figs, kiwi, legumes, mangoes, oats, peaches, peas, plums and sweet potatoes.

, Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but in other drinks such as energy drinks, carbonated beverages, tea, candies and chocolates.


Caffeine stimulates the gastrointestinal system to produce strong contractions and more bowel movements that can be seen even in healthy individuals. Additionally, its diuretic effect (condition in which the body gets rid of water through urination) can worsen dehydration caused by diarrhea.Aside from contributing to severe diarrhea, strong contractions can aggravate abdominal pain caused by the inflamed layers of bowel tissues in the digestive tract.

, Some people do not absorb fat normally, and this unabsorbed fat can make the small intestines and the colon give off more water that may result in watery stools.Normally, the colon absorbs water from the undigested liquid foods in order to firm up the stool. But if the small intestines and colon secretes more water, the colon cannot absorb all of the water from the undigested liquid foods, which now leads to diarrhea.
It is best to avoid fried foods, butter, cakes, junk foods, milk, cheese and other greasy foods.

, Sugar substitute such as sorbitol can lead to diarrhea because of its laxative effect. In order for sorbitol to exert its laxative effect, it must draw water into the large intestine, which stimulates bowel movements.


Artificial sweeteners are widely used in processed foods such as soft drinks, baked goods, powdered drink mixes, canned goods, candy, puddings, jams, jellies and dairy products.

, Secondhand smoke also contains nicotine which your child can inhale. The nicotine in cigarette smoke is a potent vasoconstrictor (constricts blood vessels).


Constriction of inflamed layers of bowel tissues in the digestive tract can further aggravate abdominal pain caused by inflammation or ulceration of the intestines.

"
Increase your child’s fluid intake.,
Add fiber to your child’s diet.,
Encourage your child to exercise regularly.",How to Treat Children with Ulcerative Colitis3," Drinking 8 or more glasses of water daily can help prevent constipation. Normally, constipation occurs because there is insufficient amount of water in the stool which makes it hard and difficult to pass. Increasing your fluid intake may aid soften the stool and save your child from the trouble of straining during bowel movement.

, Fiber-rich foods relieves constipation by pulling water from the colon, this makes the stool softer and easier to pass.Foods rich in fiber are raspberries, apple, pear, banana, orange, figs, strawberries, raisins, barley, oatmeal, popcorn, brown rice, bread, lentils, almonds, pistachio, green peas, broccoli, turnip, brussels, tomato, carrots and potato.

, Children with ulcerative colitis suffering from constipation should do regular exercises to reduce its occurrence. Exercise helps to decrease the time it takes the food to move into the large intestine. This limits the amount of water absorbed from the person’s stool into the body.


In addition, exercise stimulates the natural contraction of the intestinal muscles. If this muscles contract efficiently, stools move out quickly. The best time to exercise is an hour after a meal because the blood flow increases to the stomach and the intestines in order to aid the body digest food.You can exercise together with your child by doing low-impact exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling or swimming.

Take note of any abdominal pain.,
Keep track of any severe diarrhea.,
Watch for constipation.,
Look for reduced appetite and weight loss.,
Be wary of nausea and vomiting.,
See if your child complains of any perianal discomforts.",How to Treat Children with Ulcerative Colitis4," The abdominal pain is caused by the inflammation of the layers of the bowel tissues that lines the digestive tract. When the inflammation becomes too severe, it produces a break or damage in the intestinal membrane called ulceration.


The ulceration affects the digestive tract’s movement and leads to pain and abdominal cramping. The pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, gnawing and excruciating.

, The inflammation triggers the cells in the affected area of the intestine to secrete large amounts of water and salt which cannot be absorbed by the colon completely. The excess fluid leads to diarrhea.


It can be accompanied by blood if the inflammation in the affected area is severe. Your child may have more than 20 bowel movements per day.

, Because of the inflammation in the innermost aspect of the large intestine and rectum, the peristalsis or movement of the intestines may speed up or slow down. Therefore, if the peristalsis is slow, the digested food will remain in the large intestine for a long time. As a result, too much water is absorbed from it, making the stool hard and dry.

, Foods that travel to the digestive tract can cause discomfort to your child which in turn, reduces appetite. The nutrients and minerals from the foods ingested are not digested and absorbed properly by the body, resulting in weight loss.

, If there is an obstruction in the intestines, additional food ingestion will only contribute to further obstruction. The body normally responds by getting rid of those ingested food through vomiting.

, The anal area has special nerve fibers called C-fiber that mediates the sensation of itch. When the anus passes stool too frequently because of diarrhea, it may be irritated or damaged. As a result, C-fibers are now activated and an itchy sensation is felt."

Bathe your baby.,
Cool the room.,
Dress your baby in loose clothing.,

Apply aloe vera.,
Avoid applying creams, lotions, or ointments.,
Recognize symptoms of baby heat rash (miliaria).,
Determine if your baby is too hot.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Get a physical examination.,
Follow the doctor's treatment recommendations.",How to Treat Baby Heat Rash," As soon as you suspect your baby has heat rash, begin to cool him down. Give your baby a bath in lukewarm water to bring his body temperature down. Just avoid using cold water. Cold water could shock your baby because of the extreme temperature difference.


Let your baby air dry after his bath. It's important to keep your baby's cooled skin exposed to air. This can speed up healing.;
, You may notice your baby is overly warm after napping in a warm room. Check the temperature of the room. You should keep the room at a comfortable 68 to 72°F (20 to 22.2°C) If you need to, turn on the air conditioner or use a fan to circulate the air.


If you don't have air conditioning and a room fan isn't doing enough to cool the room, consider taking your baby to an air-conditioned public place like a mall or library.
Studies have shown a decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) if a fan runs in the baby's room while the baby sleeps., Remove your baby from swaddling or remove warm clothing (like long-sleeve shirts, coats, etc). Instead, dress your baby in all cotton or all-natural fiber clothing. This will help him cool off since moisture won't remain on her skin.Try to layer your baby's clothing so you can adjust the layers of clothing to continue cooling off your baby depending on the weather.


Babies are more prone to heat rash if they're overwarm (overdressed or swaddled) or have a fever., Soak a soft cotton washcloth in cool water and apply it to the rash to relieve itching. Once the cloth warms up, reuse the cloth by soaking it in cool water again. You can also make an herbal tea compress using herbs that have been shown to reduce inflammation. Steep 1 heaping tablespoon of herbs in 1 cup of hot water for five minutes. Let the mixture cool completely, then dip your cloth in it and apply the compress. To make the tea, use one of the following:Goldenseal
Calendula
Echinacea
Oatmeal

, Cut a stem of aloe vera. Squeeze the gel onto the rash and spread it evenly. The gel will be gooey at first, but will soon dry. Research shows that aloe vera reduces inflammation and can treat minor skin conditions.If you can't use fresh aloe vera, buy aloe vera gel from a drugstore or pharmacy. Choose a product that mainly contains aloe vera instead of preservatives or fillers.

, While you can apply natural aloe vera gel to the rash, don't apply lotions, creams, or ointments like calamine to relieve itchiness. Some doctors believe it can dry the skin, making the rash worse. Calamine shouldn't be used on very young babies (under six months old).It's also best to avoid using creams or ointments containing mineral oil or petroleum (such as Vaseline).


If you're concerned about your baby scratching his rash, ask the doctor about what you can use to relieve itchiness.

, Check your baby's skin for areas with small red bumps or blisters. You might see your baby scratching these prickly and itchy areas. Pay special attention to the skin under your baby's clothes, where her skin creases (like on the neck and under the arms), and her groin, chest, and shoulders.A heat rash (also called sweat rash or prickly heat) can show up suddenly because sweat glands become blocked, trapping sweat under the surface of the skin.

, Make sure your baby is not overdressed and is wearing loose clothing. If you're not sure whether your baby is uncomfortable, look for the following signs that your baby is overdressed or too hot:Your baby's head and neck are damp and sweaty
Your baby's face is red
Your baby is breathing too fast (more than 30 to 50 breaths a minute if he's under six months or more than 25 to 30 breaths if he's between six months old and a year)
Your baby seems irritable, cries, and fusses

, Most heat rashes will improve on their own and won't need medical treatment.But, if you don't notice your baby's rash getting better within 24 hours, or if the rash is becoming swollen, painful, or has pus, or your baby develops a fever, call your baby's pediatrician. Your baby's rash may not actually be a heat rash.


In the meantime, avoid using over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or medicated anti-itch lotions on your baby. These should only be used with your doctor's approval.

, The doctor will check your baby's rash to look for infection and determine if it is actually heat rash. Most of the time, no tests or lab work will need to be done. If the pediatrician is unsure about diagnosing the rash, you may be referred to a dermatologist.


The doctor will ask if your baby is taking medications since heat rash can occur as a side effect. For example, heat rash is a common symptom of clonidine., If the doctor diagnoses your baby with heat rash, the doctor may simply recommend cooling your baby and keeping her skin dry. Rarely, the doctor might prescribe a skin cream or lotion to treat the baby's rash. These are usually only used in severe cases.These lotions and ointments usually contain antihistamines or low-level corticosteroids to treat rash inflammation.

Learn about hiatal hernias.,
Observe the symptoms of hiatal hernias.,
Treat hiatal hernias.,
Provide aftercare.",How to Treat a Child's Hernia1," Hiatal hernias occur when the stomach protrudes into and through the diaphragm muscle (and the gap) between the chest and abdomen. In severe cases, this allows food and stomach acid to move up into the esophagus.


Some children are born with hiatal hernias. In fact, this is more common than developing them during childhood.
Most hiatal hernias do not present substantial problems, and may go undiagnosed until discovered because of unrelated problems.
Small hiatal hernias may not merit active treatment.;
, While hiatal hernias have some symptoms that are indicative of other hernias, they also have some that are unique. Thus, it is important to pay attention to all indications of a hiatal hernia.


Hiatal hernias are uniquely associated with gastroesophageal reflux.
Someone suffering from a hiatal hernia may experience heartburn when bending over, lying down, or swallowing.
A child suffering a hiatal hernia may have pain in the chest. In addition, they may burp often.
Some children who suffer hiatal hernias experience no symptoms., Treatment of hiatal hernias varies from the treatment of other childhood hernias. Thus, it is important to diagnose and treat them properly. Treatment often includes:


Medications that reduce stomach acid or strengthen the muscle between the esophagus and stomach.
The recommendation to sit up for an hour after meals.
Surgery, for extreme cases. Surgery may include a laparoscopy of the middle chest. The surgeon will make several tiny puncture holes and reduce the size of the opening that connects the chest and stomach. They may also place stitches to keep the stomach in place., Children require care after surgery to correct hiatal hernias. Aftercare for surgery to correct a hiatal hernia is substantial compared to other similar surgeries. Thus, parents and guardians need to be on guard and closely follow the directions of the child’s physician. Aftercare may include:


Dietary restrictions or a special diet.
A tube inserted into the stomach while the esophagus heals.
Hospital bedrest for up to a week.
Monitoring by the child's physician for several weeks."

Treat inguinal hernias.,
Care for the child after treatment.",How to Treat a Child's Hernia2," This type of hernia protrudes from the abdominal area into the groin area. It is one of the most common types of hernias and demands immediate attention.


In girls, inguinal hernias occur when a piece of the intestine, abdominal membrane, or a part of the ovary or fallopian protrudes into the groin area.
In boys, inguinal hernias occur when a piece of the intestine or abdominal membrane protrudes into the groin area.
Inguinal hernias affect boys much more than girls.
Groups at high risk are infants with undescended testicles and children with cystic fibrosis., The symptoms of inguinal hernias vary from that of other hernias. Without paying attention, and looking for the unique signs of an inguinal hernia, the problem may go undiagnosed until the condition worsens.


Inguinal hernias commonly appear as a bulge in the groin or scrotum, that may develop over several months.
Inguinal hernias may appear and disappear depending on the child's physical activity or position.
Bulges are often painless, but can occasionally become very painful. Any pain should be evaluated right away.
The child may experience a burning feeling around the hernia.
A child might suffer from nausea and vomiting, a symptom which indicates that the hernia needs immediate medical attention.
Inguinal hernias tend to appear on the right side., The clear majority of inguinal hernias are treated surgically. Without surgical intervention, a child’s condition can deteriorate and even become life-threatening.


The child should not eat for at least six hours before surgery.
The surgeon will move the protrusion back into position. Most often, this means moving the intestines back behind the abdominal muscle wall.
The surgeon will place stitches to lessen the chance of future hernias., After care is essential in making sure children recover quickly from surgery to treat inguinal hernias. There are a number of things to consider when doing so:


Many children will be discharged from the hospital several hours after surgery. However, infants and children with other medical conditions might stay a night or two.
Avoid pulling any tape (steri-strips) off the site of incision. They will fall off on their own, or your physician will remove them between 1 and 2 weeks after surgery.
Keep the site of incision clean and dry.
Follow all of the instructions of your physician.
Watch the site of incision for signs of bleeding or infection. If you notice any signs, contact your physician."

Educate yourself about umbilical hernias.,
Look for signs of umbilical hernias.,
Consult a doctor.,
Attend to the needs of the child after surgery.",How to Treat a Child's Hernia3," Umbilical hernias are bulges at the belly button. They occur when the intestines, abdominal lining, or fluid protrudes beyond the abdominal muscles.


Between 10% to 20% of all children experience umbilical hernias.
Rates of umbilical hernia are higher in African Americans.
Infants who are premature or suffer from low birth weight have higher chances of having an umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernias often do not demand immediate treatment and may close on their own by age 3 or 4., While umbilical hernias share several symptoms with other types of hernias, taken together, a number of symptoms are a good indication of umbilical problems. Without paying attention to your child’s discomfort, you will be unable to properly diagnose an umbilical hernia.


An umbilical hernia is characterized when a bulge or swollen area appears around the navel region. The bulge may vanish when the child lies on their back.
While it is rare, children may experience pain emanating from the abdomen. This pain may increase when the child coughs or strains.
The child may vomit or complain of nausea., As a type of hernia that is potentially less dangerous, your doctor might prescribe different types of treatment for an umbilical hernia. Thus, you should evaluate different treatments with your physician.


Some large or painful hernias may require surgery. Surgery is also usually recommended if the hernias persist after age 4, are larger than half an inch (12.7 mm), or block the intestines.
The surgery requires making a small incision below the navel. Afterwards, the hernia is secured back behind the muscle into the abdomen with stitches., Without proper care after surgery, your child may suffer serious complications that may require further medical treatment. As a result, attend to their needs.


Keep the site of incision clean. In addition, the site should be kept dry for 48 hours.
Do not remove tape, stitches, or steri-strips. They will come off on their own or will be removed by your physician 1 to 2 weeks later.
Your child should limit their activity for several days. After a few days, they can usually return to almost all of their normal behaviors.
The child should not engage in strenuous physical activity for several weeks.
Watch the site of incision for signs of infection or bleeding. If you notice any signs, contact your physician.

Start by doing something low impact, such as walking or biking, and add intensity as you get stronger.
Focus on exercises which strengthen your core, which can help reduce your risk of some of the most common types of hernia.
Aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day five days per week.;
, Constipation can cause a hernia as well, so it is important to prevent constipation to prevent a hernia.Make sure that you incorporate plenty of fiber-rich foods in your diet and drink plenty of water as well.


Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and oatmeal.

, Such support is only good for short term use after surgery. Using supportive garment in order to be able to lift more weight does not protect or prevent you from developing a hernia., Using bad posture when lifting an object may also cause a hernia. Start checking your posture before you lift an object to ensure that you are using good lifting posture. Some things to keep in mind when lifting objects include:Keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles tight.
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
Use your leg muscles to do the work rather than your back.
Don't turn by twisting at the waist. Turn with your entire body.

, Smoker’s cough can become severe and this frequent, hard coughing lead to a hernia.Smoking also increases your risk of developing cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and many other serious conditions.


If you smoke, ask your doctor about medications and smoking cessation programs that may help you to quit.

, Sometimes hernias may be caused by wearing clothing that fits too tightly around your waist. To eliminate this factor, make sure that you wear clothing that fits comfortably and that does not put too much pressure on your waist.Wear clothing a size larger than you need to provide some extra space around your waist.
Wear clothes with an elastic waistband instead of fitted clothes.

, You are also at a higher risk of developing a hernia after you have eaten. To reduce your risk, don’t bend over or lay down for about two to three hours after eating.


Sit upright or recline in a chair after eating and avoid doing anything that requires you to bend over."

Start each workout with a low-impact version of the exercise that you are about to do. For example, if you are planning to go for a run, then start off with five minutes of brisk walking., Using poor form or fast, jerky movements can also increase your risk of hernia during a workout. Avoid fast, jerky movements when you exercise. Make sure that you use slow, steady movements instead., Pushing yourself too hard can increase your risk of injury, which may include a hernia.If you start to feel pain or discomfort, then decrease your intensity for a while.


Make sure that you give yourself a rest day each week as well. A rest day doesn't mean you remain completely inactive, however. Try some gentle yoga or something low-intensity, such as a short, leisurely walk.

, Certain areas of your body are more susceptible to hernias and it is possible to strengthen these areas, but you should seek the help of a professional to do this. A personal trainer may be able to help you strengthen hernia-prone areas (such as your core) if you are concerned about developing a hernia.

, When collecting fresh water, you should not take water from just any source. You're vastly less likely to contract guinea worm if you look for water in bore-hole wells, dug wells, and springs.A bore-hole well is a narrow shaft bored into the ground, either horizontally or vertically. Typically, bore hole wells will have a metallic pipe stemming from the well, from which water is released. There will also be pavement around the well to prevent the bore-hole from collapsing.Look around your community for bore-hole wells and ask locals where you're likely to find them.
If you see safe water supplies, such as hand pumps, near a well or spring, this is a good sign the water here is safe.
Springs with protective walls surrounding them are less likely to be infected with guinea worm.

, Flowing water is far less likely to be contaminated with guinea worm. Try to collect water from rivers and streams where water has a steady flow. This can help reduce your risk of collecting contaminated water.You can also collect water flowing from waterfalls.
If you don't find any wells or other sources of clean water, spend some time searching out flowing water.

, If you're traveling long distances for work or other obligations, you may be unable to find safe water supplies. It can get very hot when traveling, and it's dangerous to go long periods without water. Carry a pipe filter. You can drink water from a potentially dangerous source if you drink it through the filter.Place one end of your pipe filter in the questionable water. Place your lips on the other end of the filter and drink through the straw. The filter should offer some protection from guinea worm.
Keep in mind this should be a last resort. Always exhaustively search for safe sources of water before using a filtered straw to drink from an unsafe source. You should also pack bottled water if you're traveling a long distance.

, If you or anyone you know has guinea worm sores or ulcers, these sores can contaminate clean water. Ask that people with sores do not walk or bathe in clean water sources. If you are recovering from a guinea worm infection yourself, stay away from clean water until you have a clean bill of medical health., Even when collecting water from a safe source, filter it before drinking. Place a piece of clean cloth over a bucket. Then, pour your collected water through the cloth into the bucket. You may catch some guinea worm maggots by doing this. You can also feed water through a large pipe filter, or use something like a brita filter on water. This can also help remove guinea worm maggots.If you're traveling to an area where guinea worm is present, bring a water filtration system with you.

, If you have to collect water from an unsafe source, use a larvicide on the water before drinking it. Approved larvicides include products like ABATE. They kill tiny fleas and larvae that can cause a guinea worm infection. Follow the instructions on the package for use.You can find larvicides at some local stores. Ask locals about where to find larvicides.
If you're traveling to an area with guinea worm, consider buying larvicide online ahead of time. Take it with you on your trip.

, Guinea worm is a serious medical concern. If you believe you have contracted guinea worm, prompt medical treatment is vital to your wellbeing. If you notice any symptoms of guinea worm infection, seek medical help immediately.Fever, swelling, and pain near the infected area are usually the first signs of an infection.
You will not have symptoms for about a year after becoming infected. If you traveled to an area where guinea worm is a problem, do not assume symptoms you have months later are not related to guinea worm.

, A guinea worm takes months to be removed. It will emerge a few centimeters a day from a certain body part. Typically, guinea worms emerge from the legs or feet. Treatment is a matter of slowly removing the worm while covering your wound for the duration of the day.In most cases, the worm will take months to fully emerge. Sometimes, however, it may only take a few weeks to rid yourself of a guinea worm. Usually, a doctor winds the worm around a small stick each day as it comes out of your body. Then, the wound is covered in gauze for the remainder of the day.
Be very careful about personal hygiene when a guinea worm infection is being treated. You are more prone to bacterial infections during this time. Make sure you change your gauze regularly.

, The process of removing a guinea worm is incredibly painful. Over-the-counter painkillers, like Ibuprofen, can be used to manage the pain. Make sure you do not take more than the recommended dosage on the bottle. If you are on any existing medications, talk to your doctor before you begin to take medication for guinea worm.If you're dealing with young children with a guinea worm infection, make sure you opt for child-safe painkillers.

, You will be laid up for the months your guinea worm infection is being treated. Guinea worm infections are debilitating because they are so painful. You will be unable to care for your children or go in to work. Make sure you find a friend or family member to take care of your obligations during the recovery process.Check your office's policy on sick leave. See if you can get medical leave while your infection is being treated. You could also look into working remotely if you're guinea worm infection is a problem.

Consult your doctor as soon as you notice signs of lymphedema.,
Avoid having blood drawn from arms at risk for lymphedema.,
Avoid taking long, hot baths or showers.,
Don't carry heavy objects or shoulder bags.,
Avoid wearing constricting clothes or jewelry.,
Elevate your limb.,
Change your position.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Protect your extremities from any kind of injury.,
Eat a well-balanced, low-sodium diet.,
Maintain a healthy body weight.,
Cultivate a healthy lifestyle.,
Don't smoke.",How to Prevent Lymphedema1," Signs of lymphedema include swelling in the arms, legs, hands, fingers, neck or breast. If you notice swelling or other signs (see below) make an appointment with your doctor immediately.Getting to know the early signs of lymphedema is one of the best ways of preventing the condition from worsening.
There isn't a cure for lymphedema, but early treatment can minimize its symptoms and prevent others from occurring.
Lymphedema can occur within days, weeks, months, or even years following treatment for cancer.;
, Lymphedema commonly develops in the same quarter of the body in which surgery was done. Avoid receiving any injections, or IV injections, in the arm at risk for developing lymphedema.When taking your blood pressure, put cuff on the arm less likely to be affected by lymphedema.
You might want to purchase a medical alert bracelet to alert others not to take blood, insert IVs, or receive injections in the affected arm.

, Don't immerse the limbs likely to be affected by lymphedema into hot water, steam baths or other high heat areas. If you decide to take a hot bath, avoid putting your arms into the water.Don't use heating pads or other heat treatments.
Avoid getting deep body massage on the affected area.
Heat and massage draw increased body fluid into the area, which can trigger lymphedema.
Keep your arm out of the sunshine when possible.

, For the recovery following a surgery or cancer treatment, avoid using the affected side of the body to carry heavy things. Be careful to avoid heavy weight-bearing exertion with the arm at risk of developing lymphedema.When you're carrying heavy objects, keep the arm raised above the waist.
As you strengthen over time, you can gradually return to carrying heavier objects.

, If your watch, rings, bracelets or other jewelry feel tight, either loosen them or stop wearing them. Make sure your clothing is loose-fitting and doesn't constrain movement.Avoid wearing tops with tight necklines if you're at risk for developing head or neck lymphedema.
Constriction around the neck, arm, leg, wrist or other body part can contribute to fluid buildup in that area.

, If you are at risk for getting lymphedema, one way to prevent it is to keep the at-risk limb elevated when possible. This will prevent body fluid from settling into the limb and causing swelling.This preventative measure is most effective in keeping lymphedema from developing in the arms, hands or fingers.
You can choose to sleep with your leg elevated above your heart, if you sleep on your back. Place a pillow beneath your knees or feet.

, Try not to sit or stand for long periods of time. Instead, remind yourself to change your position regularly. Don't cross your legs when you're seated, and prop yourself into a more upright position in bed.Being upright in bed improves the drainage of lymph fluids in the body.
You might need to set regular alerts on your phone or timer to remind you to move regularly. Take advantage of naturally occurring reminders as well. If you watching television, make sure to change positions during every commercial break, for instance.

, Cuts, sunburn or other burns, insect bites, and cat scratches can all bring fluid to the affected area, thus raising the likeliness of lymphedema. Wearing loose long sleeves and pants may help guard against skin injury.Make sure your clothing is loose, not tight.
Never wear athletic arm sleeves, as they constrain the arm.

, Any cuts, open wounds, scrapes, or burns to the affected arm or limb can cause infection. Presence of infection prevents the lymphatic fluid from filtering out bacteria and viruses. Signs of infection include: swelling, pain, redness, warmth, and fever. If these symptoms are present, go to the nearest hospital for treatment and management.Don’t allow sharp objects to puncture your skin.
You should always use a thimble when sewing, wear thick gloves when gardening, and apply insect repellents when outside.
Keep skin moist by applying mild moisturizers to prevent it from drying and cracking.
Take extra precaution during shaving if you are using a regular razor.
If you get manicures, don't cut or pull your cuticles. Try to find a manicurist who's familiar with your health history and can work with your special needs.If you're going to a new manicurist, check their health history online. Never go to a place with reports of unsanitary practices, or if clients have experienced bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.
Wear gloves while doing housework or garden work to avoid injury to the hands, fingers or nails.
Wearing comfortable, closed-toe shoes reduces risk to injury of the foot and toes.

, Include two to three servings of fruit, three to five servings of vegetables daily. Eat foods that are high in fiber, including whole-grain breads, cereals, pasta, rice, fresh fruits and vegetables. For best results, avoid alcoholic beverages or limit your intake to one per day.Avoid high-calorie, nutritionally inadequate fast foods or junk foods. In addition to being high-calorie and low-nutrition, these foods are often very high in sodium.
Cut back on red meat and processed meat products like hot dogs, sausage or bacon.

, Being overweight or obese contributes to the risk of developing lymphedema. This is because it puts additional pressure on areas that are already swollen and causes further interruption of lymphatic fluid drainage.Proper diet, exercise, and discipline are key to maintaining the ideal body weight.
If you need help with this, ask your medical health care provider. She can offer suggestions and local resources based on her understanding of your condition.

, Getting to a healthy weight and staying there can help prevent lymphedema from developing. Following healthy eating habits and including regular exercise are part of overall healthy living.Getting enough sleep will help maintain a strong immune system, and reduce your risk of developing lymphedema.
Work with your medical health care provider to establish healthy exercise routines. Strenuous exercise may not be recommended, but try to include exercise as part of your daily routine.

, Smoking narrows the capillaries and small blood vessels, which makes it harder for fluids to flow freely around the body. It depletes the skin of oxygen and other needed nutrients found in healthy blood flow. Smoking also damages the elasticity of the skin.If you need help quitting smoking, ask your doctor or healthcare provider. There are many supports to help people quit smoking.
Quitting smoking also helps minimize risk for developing other cancers and health problems.

Wash your hands often.,
Avoid direct contact with others.,
Disinfect common areas.,
Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.,
Separate contagious people.,
Teach children how to avoid infection at school.","How to Prevent Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease1"," Like many viral infections, the first line of defense against spreading HFMD is simply to wash your hands thoroughly and regularly. Your hands are most likely to come into contact with other people throughout your day and HFMD is spread primarily through direct contact. Teach your children the proper way to wash their hands to help them avoid contracting HFMD at school.To properly wash your hands, run them under warm water to wet them, then apply soap.
Lather the soap over your entire hands, including the backs.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them. Sing ""Happy Birthday"" at least once while you're washing your hands to determine this time approximately.
Dry your hands thoroughly.;
, When there’s a risk of HFMD infection, it’s important to avoid direct physical contact with anyone that may be carrying the virus. HFMD transmits easily through close contact with others.Tell your kids not to hug or wrestle with other children at school.
Do not share eating utensils or drinking glasses with anyone.

, In order to prevent the transmission of the virus that causes HFMD, you will need to regularly disinfect common areas where people infected with the virus may have been. It is a good habit to regularly disinfect any high traffic areas, particularly in schools and daycares.Use soap and water to clean areas, then disinfect them with a diluted solution of chlorine bleach and water.
Disinfectant sprays also do a good job of eliminating the virus that causes HFMD on most surfaces.
Make sure to clean counters, doorknobs, children’s toys and anything else people touch regularly.

, You and those around you will need to exercise good cough and sneeze etiquette in order to minimize the chances of infecting one another if anyone were to become infected with HFMD.Use your arm to cover your mouth so as not to cover your hands in germs.
Dispose of tissues you use immediately and don’t leave them anywhere others may come in contact with them.
Wash your hands after you cough or sneeze into them to prevent the spread of the virus.

, If you know someone that is exhibiting the symptoms of, or has been diagnosed with, HFMD you should keep them separate from others, particularly small children. While HFMD is usually a mild viral infection, it can lead to more serious issues. If one of your children exhibits symptoms of the illness, quarantine them in a room separate from any other children until they have recovered.Limit the exposure of people exhibiting symptoms to all others, particularly children.
Keep sick children home from school so as to prevent them from spreading it to others.
Stay home from work or school if you recognize the symptoms in yourself.

, It can be very easy to transmit infections like HFMD at school because of the number of children and their lack of understanding about sharing germs. Teach your kids good practices at home so they are better prepared while in class.Teach your children proper cough and sneeze etiquette.
Encourage your children to wash their hands frequently, especially immediately before eating.
Make sure they know not to share beverages or utensils at school.
Tell your children to keep their hands and other objects away from their face and out of their mouth.

Notice swelling in the arms, legs, breast or hand.,
Pay attention to heaviness in arms or legs.,
Be aware if you have trouble moving joints.,
Notice itching or burning in toes or legs.,
Check for thickening of the skin (hyperkeratosis).,
Pay attention when clothing or jewelry doesn't fit.,
Observe tight, shiny, warm or red skin.",How to Prevent Lymphedema2," Swelling in the soft tissue of the arms or legs is one of the most common signs of lymphedema. In early stages, the skin remains soft. Pressing on the swollen area may leave a dent.Your doctor may want to measure the affected area using a tape measure in order to monitor swelling.
In later stages of lymphedema, the swelling will become firm and hard. Pressing the swollen area won't leave a dent.

, In addition or before noticing swelling, you may feel the weight of fluid buildup in the arms and legs. Your limbs may feel difficult to move. If you are at risk for developing lymphedema, this may be an early symptom.If you’ve had any type of surgery, radiation treatment, or lymph nodes removed, take a close look at your body in a full-length mirror and check for swelling.
Compare both sides of your body, and check for differences.

, Stiffness in your fingers, toes, knees, elbows or other joints can be a sign of increased fluid buildup due to lymphedema. While there are many reasons for stiffness in joints, pressure on joints due to buildup in body fluids can be a sign of lymphedema.Symptoms of lymphedema may occur gradually, or they may come about all at once.
Get to know your body well, and notice what's normal for you.

, This may be a sign of cellulitis, a non-contagious infection of the skin. Because of the way lymphedema affects the immune system, it's important to see your doctor immediately if you notice symptoms of cellulitis.Cellulitis may be triggered by insect bites or scratches.
Your doctor will treat the infection with antibiotics. Do not delay attending to the infection, because it can quickly become life-threatening.

, Fluid retention can cause thickening of the skin. If you notice thicker skin developing on your arms, hands, legs or feet with or without other skin changes such as blisters or warts, this can be a sign of lymphedema.Keeping your skin meticulously clean is essential for people with hyperkeratosis.
Use a therapeutic-based moisturizer daily, and avoid lanolin-based or fragrant lotions.

, Many people with lymphedema report feeling uncomfortable in their bras, even though they've not gained weight. If your rings don't fit, or your watch and bracelet feel uncomfortably snug, this may be a sign of lymphedema.You might notice that you have trouble fitting your arm into your sleeve on one side of your body.
Because symptoms of lymphedema may develop gradually, you may not notice swelling in your shoulders or arms until you have difficulty fitting into your clothes. If your clothing starts to feel tighter on one side, or if you have trouble putting on a close-fitting shirt or jacket, look for signs of lymphedema.

, The skin might appear ""glossy"" or ""stretched"". This may be a sign of cellulitis. If your skin coloration or texture changes in this way, see a doctor immediately.The affected area may spread rapidly once observed.
You may also notice fatigue, fever, aches and other flu-like symptoms. Or, you may not experience any of these other signs.

"
"
Notice swelling in the eyes, face, lips, neck, or area below the chin.,
Feel for tightness or swelling in affected areas.,
Be aware if you experience changes in vision due to eye swelling.,
Observe if you have a hard time swallowing, speaking or breathing.",How to Prevent Lymphedema3," Symptoms of head and neck lymphedema typically appear 2-6 months following cancer treatment in the area of the head. Lymphedema sometime develops in the larynx and pharynx (the mouth and throat). It may also develop externally in the neck and face, or a combination of both, depending on which lymphatic channels are obstructed.See your doctor if you notice any signs of lymphedema in the head or neck.
Unmanaged swelling may result in a series of additional inflammations that rapidly become more difficult to manage.

, Because it may be difficult to detect visual cues of swelling in the head and neck, the first symptoms of lymphedema in these areas are likely to be felt sensations. Notice any sign of tightness in your head and neck.You may experience difficulty moving your head, neck or face. Your skin may feel stiff or uncomfortable, though you can't see any apparent signs of swelling.
Your doctor may want to conduct additional tests to check for lymphedema, including lymphoscintigraphy or another imaging technique that relies upon injection of contrast dyes to show lymphatic fluid flow abnormalities.

, Blurred vision, excess or unexplained tearing and redness of the eye, feeling pain behind the eye are all possible signs of lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. This is a genetic condition present at birth, but signs may not appear before puberty onset.The growth of additional eyelashes along the interior lining of the eyelid are also signs of lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome.
Other eye problems resulting from this condition include irregular curvature of the cornea, and corneal scarring.

, In more severe cases of lymphedema, swelling of tissue in the neck and throat will affect basic bodily functions. You may notice drooling or spilling food from the mouth.Swelling may also result in nasal congestion or inner-ear pain. It might affect sinus glands and passages.
To confirm presence of lymphedema in the neck and head, the doctor may perform an ultrasound or an MRI. These tests can show placement of lymphatic fluids within the head cavity.

"
"
Check for a fever first.,
Watch out for blisters.,
Look for other symptoms.,
Keep an eye out for more severe symptoms.","How to Prevent Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease2"," It usually takes three to six days after being initially infected before you begin to show symptoms of infection. While symptoms do not always present themselves in this order, fever is often the first sign of HFMD infection.If you believe you have been exposed to the virus, look for signs of fever over the course of the next week.
Seek medical attention if your fever exceeds 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Fevers can be particularly dangerous for young children. Check a child's temperature often to ensure it doesn’t get too high.

, After the fever, you may develop painful blister-like lesions inside your mouth. This is usually the most significant evidence of HFMD infection, though there are other illnesses that could feasibly cause similar lesions.Blister-like lesions will appear on the tongue, gums, and inside the cheeks.
Skin lesions may also appear on your hands, feet, legs, arms, and buttocks. Much less commonly, there may be skin lesions on your torso and face.
Lesions may make swallowing painful, but it’s important to stay well hydrated.
Do not pop the blisters or let your children do so if they’re infected. The fluid inside is contagious and may spread the illness.

, While the fever is usually the first to present itself, it is not the last indicator of HFMD infection. There are a number of other symptoms associated with the illness and though they may not all present themselves, noticing any of these symptoms is good reason to make an appointment with your doctor:Sore Throat
Loss of energy and feeling generally unwell
Loss of appetite
Red rash that doesn’t itch on the palms, soles of feet and buttocks.

, Sometimes HFMD infection can cause more serious health issues so it’s important to keep your eye out for more significant issues if you believe you or someone you know has been infected with HFMD. Seek immediate medical attention if you see or experience any of the following:Inability to urinate
Trouble moving a portion of or your entire body
Coughing up pink, foamy spit
Unusually high heart rate for an extended amount of time

"
"
Treat it like the flu.,
Sooth a sore throat.,
Stay well fed and hydrated.,
Treat the symptoms.,
Give it time.","How to Prevent Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease3"," There are no vaccines to prevent or antibiotics to treat HFMD infections, so the treatment method is usually very similar to how one might treat the flu. Your body will usually have to fend off the viral infection on its own.Drink plenty of fluids
Get lots of rest
Avoid acidic juices like orange juice due to the blistering in the mouth.

, Often the most difficult symptom of HFMD to overcome is the sore throat. It’s extremely important that you or your child stay hydrated while fighting off the infection, so try these steps to manage the pain of a sore throat.Stay hydrated. It may be painful to swallow fluids, but keeping enough water in your system can go far to alleviate the pain of a sore throat.
Drink caffeine free tea with water or honey
Gargle with salt water
Use lozenges, but do not give them to children under four years old.

, You need to make sure you and your children continue to eat a healthy diet and stay hydrated while your bodies combat an HFMD infection. Try these foods that are both nutritious and soothing:Bananas are a non-acidic fruit with great nutritional value that can be very soothing for your throat.
Chicken soup can help keep you hydrated and well nourished while easing a sore throat.
Scrambled eggs and egg whites are a great source of protein and soothe inflammation.
Oatmeal is filling, nutritious and soothing and can be combined with bananas or honey to increase the soothing effect.

, While there may be no medicine to treat the HFMD infection, you may still want to treat the symptoms to increase your comfort as your body fends off the virus. Only use medications as prescribed or recommended by your doctor.


Use paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen (not aspirin) to treat fever and discomfort.You can also use ibuprofen for pain.
A medical mouthwash can be prescribed to ease the pain of the blisters in the mouth., Most HFMD infections are mild and resolved within a few days. Like many other viral infections, your body will still carry the virus after the symptoms are no longer present, so be particularly careful not to spread the virus in the days after you begin to feel better.You may still be contagious for a few days after you begin to feel better, so be conscious of spreading the virus and keep your children out of school until you’re sure they have recovered.
It is possible for the infection to reappear if your immune system becomes compromised, so stay well hydrated and continue to get plenty of rest for a week after you begin to feel better.
If you or your children do not begin to recover after a few days, contact your doctor.

Obesity
Excessive alcohol consumption
Diabetes
Impaired immune function (from an autoimmune disease like HIV or treatment such as chemotherapy)
Intravenous drug use
Use of warfarin, an anticoagulant drug, though this is very rare. Using both warfarin and heparin together can increase your risk.;
, If you're at risk for gangrene because of a condition such as diabetes, it's important to check your feet over every day for possible problems. If you have trouble looking at the bottom of your feet, have someone help you or use a mirror. Watch for the following symptoms:Discoloration, going from red to dark and black
A clear line between healthy skin and affected skin
A foul smell (for wet gangrene)
A shiny appearance to the skin
Coldness in the extremity
Pain, followed by loss of sensation
Loss of pulse in arteries

, Even if you don't shower every day, you should wash your feet in warm water (about 90 to 95°F or 32 to 35°C). Try not to soak your feet, as that can lead to dry skin. Instead, wash with gentle soap, then wash the soap away. Dry your feet thoroughly, including between your toes.When you have corns or callouses, be gentle. Don't use razor blades or chemical removers, as they can be too harsh on your skin. Instead, gently smooth them away after you bathe. An even better solution is getting a podiatrist to take care of the problem.After you wash, be sure to put on a good lotion. Keeping your feet moisturized can help prevent cracked heels and other types of cuts.
Make sure to wash any cuts with soap and water to stave off infection. Keep them dry otherwise, and covered with sterile dressing., Trimming your toenails is important in preventing gangrene, as not trimming them can lead to ingrown toenails and cuts. Try to trim them at least once a week or when you notice they grow out longer. Your doctor or podiatrist can help if you can't do it yourself.Don't round toenails off like you do your nails. You should cut them straight across to prevent ingrown toenails.
Smooth off the edges with a file.

, Throughout the day, get your blood moving to your feet by tapping your feet and wiggling your toes. More blood circulation means better healing when you do get cuts, so moving around can help prevent a bad infection from setting in., Make sure you are going in for your yearly checkups. Your doctor knows what to look for when it comes to gangrene, and she may catch something you miss. In addition, watching a doctor check your feet can help you know how to do it properly yourself., It can be tempting to run outside for a minute without your shoes; however, even a small dash outside can lead to a cut you don't feel, which in turn could eventually lead to gangrene. Putting your shoes on to protect your feet is an important part of maintaining foot health.It can also be a good idea to wear slippers around the house, so you don't stub your toe or step on something you shouldn't.
In fact, some doctors recommend wearing socks and shoes at all times, even indoors, to protect your feet.Also, put socks on. Wearing shoes without socks can lead to a number of abrasions or cuts, as well as blisters. If you're diabetic, cuts may not heal as easily, which in turn could lead to gangrene. Always wear socks with your shoes to help protect your feet from problems., When picking out shoes, make sure they fit properly. Walk around in them a bit to make sure they are comfortable everywhere. In addition, make sure you have room to wriggle your toes. You don't want anything too narrow that will squeeze them.It's best to shop at night rather than in the morning, because your feet swell during the day.
If you can get away with it, athletic shoes are the best option because they provide the most support and comfort. Skip anything that leaves your foot exposed, as you could damage your foot.
Also, don't break in shoes all at once. Wear them for a couple of hours each day, so you don't end up with a blister.

, If you have nerve damage in your feet, it's easy to damage them with extreme temperatures. Therefore, you should keep your feet away from heat sources such as hot pavement, beaches, and radiators, and wear sunscreen on your feet if they are exposed. Also, try to skip extreme colds, such as ice packs, and keep your feet warm in the winter with socks at night and during the day., Diabetes is one of the main diseases that can lead to gangrene. If your diabetes is out of control, you likely have too much sugar or glucose in your blood. That, in turn, can lead to nerve damage and low blood flow. Nerve damage means you don't have as much sensation in your feet, and cuts can go unnoticed, which in turn, can lead to gangrene., One way to help manage your diabetes is through diet. As a diabetic, you have to eat a good balance of protein, fruits and vegetables, and healthy carbohydrates. You need enough carbohydrates and protein to keep your blood sugar up, while not eating so many that your blood sugar gets too high.One way to focus on healthy eating is to divide your plate. A quarter of it should be devoted to healthy whole grains, such as brown rice or whole wheat bread. Another quarter should be a healthy protein, such as fish or chicken.
The other half should be taken up with fruits and vegetables.
Also, try to replace any sugary drinks, such as juice or soda, with water or unsweetened tea.
Talking to a nutritionist to help you set up a healthy eating plan.

, Exercising more can also help you stay healthy and manage your diabetes. You should be exercising at least three times a week. If you haven't been exercising much, start small, such as taking a 10 minute walk each time, and then work up to longer.When picking out exercises, try to choose ones that are easy on your feet. For instance, walking is pretty easy on your feet, as is swimming and bicycling.
Exercises that require you to run or jump are much harder on your feet., Checking your blood sugar can help you manage your diabetes. It can tell you when you may need to eat more at certain meals, as well as when your blood sugar is getting too high, and you need to eat less.Your doctor will let you know how many times a day you need to check your blood sugar.
For example, if your blood sugars are particularly unstable, you may need to check them before every meal, as well as one to two hours after every meal to see how it fluctuates throughout the day, as well as bedtime. If you are more stable, you may be able to check it only twice a day.

, If you are having trouble managing your diabetes at home, don't be afraid to talk to your doctor. He may need to put you on a different medication to help you better manage your diabetes, or they may even need to start you on insulin., Alcohol can make your diabetes worse. In addition, it can raise your blood pressure and your cholesterol, which can increase your chances of developing gangrene. Therefore, it's best to try to cut down on your alcohol intake.Men should limit themselves to one to two drinks a day, while women should stick with one or less.
One drink is a single beer (12 ounces), a glass of wine (5 ounces), or one shot of hard liquor (1.5 ounces)., Before you quit, it's important to make sure you know the reason you want to quit.Smoking can increase your likelihood of developing gangrene, so that can be a good motivator for wanting to quit.Smoking worsens the effects of nerve damage. It can lead to smaller blood vessels that aren't as flexible, which means your feet aren't getting as much blood.
When you have a wound, blood flow helps heal the wound. Therefore, smoking can slow down the healing process, which in turn can lead to gangrene.

, The national Quit hotline is 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. When you call the hotline, you'll be put in touch with someone who can get you started with quitting. They can also put you in contact with local resources that can help you quit., Often, people will smoke at a certain time of day, with certain people, or during a certain activity. If you know what will trigger you to smoke, you can start combating them by having a plan of action in place.For instance, if you like to smoke after dinner, take the family for a walk instead.
If you're a fan of smoking and playing pool, you might need to stop playing pool for a bit.

, Nicotine replacements include patches, tablets, inhalers, gum, and several other options. They give you a dose of nicotine to help you deal with the cravings, and they can help you deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Since nicotine is the addictive part of cigarettes, getting smaller doses of that particular drug can help you quit., If your friends and family know you want to quit, they can help you to do it. For instance, if they see you wanting to light up, they can discourage you to stop. If one of them smokes, they can quit asking you if you want one, too, when they light up. They can also help you deal with some of the other symptoms of withdrawal, such as depression and anxiety, by being there when you need to talk.Often, you will taper off of these much like you might taper off of cigarettes. For instance, you may take half a dose after two weeks of being on them.

Understand the causes of confusion.",How to Prevent Confusion," If you don't use your cognitive abilities and practice them routinely, you will eventually lose those abilities.If you can, try to learn something new, like a language, a musical instrument, or even a new skill set. If you can't pick up something new, you can alter your daily routine in simpler ways to strengthen your cognitive abilities, like doing a word puzzle, reading parts of the newspaper you normally don't read, or taking an alternate route you wouldn't normally take while driving.Other ways to use your cognitive abilities include reading, joining a book club (which incorporates social interaction), playing strategy games like chess, or taking classes to learn something new.;
, When people are alone for long periods of time, they become prone to depression, stress, and anxiety, and these symptoms can contribute to confusion and memory loss over time.A great way to ward off confusion is to spend time with other people. Being around others encourages you to recall past events and process current events in order to carry on a conversation, which is a great way to stay mentally sharp while also enjoying other people's company.Having great social support is especially important when dealing with confusion in elderly people.
Try spending time with friends, relatives, or even strangers through volunteer work.Do not isolate yourself. Stay engaged with life and your social surroundings.

, Organizing your environment will help you avoid confusion about your immediate surroundings while also strengthening your memory and thinking skills.If you're not hyper-organized, that's okay — you can start in little ways and see where your organization efforts lead you. Studies show that taking the guesswork out of day-to-day chores and events can help you focus and concentrate more on learning new things and remembering important events/memories.Try writing down appointments, errands, chores, and things you'll need to pick up when you're at the store. Make a habit of carrying that list with you everywhere you go and checking it on a daily basis.Try keeping these lists on your smartphone.
Choose a designated place for essentials that you'll need every day, like your wallet, keys, and mobile phone (if you carry one). That way you'll never waste time looking for the things you need before you leave the house.Take opportunities to tidy up your home, especially by reducing clutter. Go through old papers, notes, and to-do lists and throw them away if you no longer need them.Journaling may be a good way to keep your thoughts organized and keep track of your day-to-day life and obligations.

, Using more than one sense when you learn or experience something new helps keep multiple parts of your brain active and may help retain memories and learning abilities.Studies have shown that experiencing something with only one sense makes you less likely to remember or retain that information/experience than experiencing it with two or more senses.Try challenging your senses in little ways every day. When you try an unfamiliar dish at a restaurant, notice the smell before and after you taste the food. Challenge yourself to identify certain ingredients, or practice your cognitive abilities by reading a newspaper or book while you savor the smells and tastes of an unfamiliar dish., Having a routine can help with memory and cognitive ability. Any time you maintain a routine, your brain has an easier time making connections and recognizing patterns of your own behavior. It sounds simple, but just having a regular day-to-day routine may help reduce the effects of confusion and memory loss over time.For instance, make sure you get up and go to bed at the same time each day, which can help improve your sleep and overall health.

, Mnemonic devices are used to help you remember lists, orders of operation, and musical scales, but you can also make your own mnemonic devices to help you remember anything from your daily life. Try writing out the steps of something you need to do, then take the first letter of each word and try to put it in a related word or phrase. For example, the musical notes E, G, B, D, and F is easily remembered with the sentence, ""Every Good Boy Does Fine.""Creating and using mnemonic devices helps you strengthen both your thinking abilities and your memory. Finding ways to remember the steps of a certain process may also help free up your memory to process and retain new information., Dehydration is a common cause of confusion, and is easily preventable. Dehydration occurs any time your body loses more water than you ingest.Unfortunately, confusion caused by dehydration is usually a sign of severe dehydration, and may require medical assistance.Drinking water or sports drinks can help treat mild to moderate dehydration. For more severe cases, intravenous saline administration (performed by a medical professional) may be required., Dietary improvements can often help or prevent confusion. It's important to eat fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean, low-fat protein sources like fish, skinless poultry, and tofu.Avoid alcohol. Alcohol is a common contributor to confusion and/or memory loss.This can commonly occur after people stop drinking after they have been drinking every day.
Make sure you get sufficient vitamin B12 and folate in your diet, as these are believed to help protect the nervous system.Some studies suggest ginkgo biloba, an herbal supplement, may help improve memory and strengthen cognitive abilities.Talk to your doctor about any supplements you're interested in before you begin taking them.

, Sleep is an important part of cognitive ability, as sleep helps strengthen and solidify memories in our brains. Being sleep deprived may also lead to feelings of confusion and uncertainty.Practice good sleep hygiene. Create a pre-bedtime routine (such as taking a shower, listening to soothing music, etc.) and stick to a sleep schedule.
Most adults and older individuals need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Make sure you are well rested to help prevent confusion and disorientation., Physical exercise helps increase blood flow to the brain, which may help keep your cognitive abilities at their best.If you are physically capable, try to meet the Department of Health and Human Services minimum of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise each week.You also need to include two to three days of strength training each week for a total of at least 40 minutes.


Moderate aerobic exercise might involve walking briskly, while vigorous exercise might involve running or bicycling., High blood pressure, when left untreated, can cause significant problems with your memory and problem-solving ability.If you've been prescribed medication for your blood pressure, take that medicine as your doctor instructed you. If you are not currently on medication, talk to your doctor about medicinal options and ways to lower your blood pressure, such as weight loss or dietary changes., Even if you have known the confused person for many years (whether through friendship, family, or simply acquaintance), you should always identify or introduce yourself to a confused person. Many people suffering from confusion become frightened, which may lead to erratic or even violent behavior if someone perceived as a stranger suddenly approaches without warning.Say your name, and remind the person how you know each other. Speak slowly and approach the person with caution., Sometimes having even small reminders can help a confused person recall who they are and where they are. Other times people become confused about what time, day, or year it is.If someone you know is confused, try to help by:


Reminding the individual where they are at the momentPutting a calendar and clock near the individual so that they can check the date and time as often as they need toTalking about current events, recent events, and any plans for the day, Some people who experience confusion also experience subsequent fear or anxiety. One way to help combat this is to keep the individual's immediate environment quiet, calm, and relaxing.If possible, remove things that might be traumatic or upsetting from the individual's immediate area. You don't necessarily need to get rid of these things, but ""hiding"" them until the confused person feels better may help speed up their recovery time.Be aware of ""sundowning."" At the end of the day people with dementia can become more confused and depressed. Talk with the person's doctor if you think they are suffering from sundowning. They may have suggestions for medication or therapy that can help.
Try keeping windows open during the day. This may keep the patient more alert, awake, and less confused.

, Some people experience confusion caused by low blood sugar (diabetes medications are a common cause of this). In these instances, you may want to consider offering the individual a small, sweet snack or beverage.Evening out their blood sugar might even out their mood and allow them to think better without getting angry.


Juice is an excellent thing to give someone who is confused because of low blood sugar. Small snacks, including a cookie or some pretzels, can also help.Glucose tablets may be a requirement for people experiencing low blood sugar. If at all possible, know the individual's preferred treatment plan in advance in order to best help him recover from his bout of confusion., If confusion occurs without any previous history of this symptom, or if the symptom begins to affect day-to-day life, call a doctor immediately.Your doctor will do a physical exam and may order blood/urine tests, neuropsychological tests, an electroencephalogram (EEG), and/or a CT scan of the head.In some cases, the individual may need to go to the emergency room. Call an emergency responder if you or someone you know experiences confusion and any of the following:Cold or clammy skin
Dizziness or feeling faint
Rapid pulse
Fever
Headache
Irregular breathing (slow or rapid)
Uncontrollable shivering
Diabetic complications
A head injury
Loss of consciousness

, There are many medical complications that can cause confusion. How you treat confusion may depend on the underlying cause(s). Common health complications that may lead to confusion include:Intoxication (drugs or alcohol — temporary complication)
Brain tumor (may be treatable if the tumor can be treated/removed)
Head trauma or injury, including concussion (usually temporary, but requires a medical evaluation and immediate treatment)
Fever (temporary)
Fluid/electrolyte imbalance (often from dehydration — temporary complication, as long as fluids are administered as soon as possible)
Illness, including dementia (permanent complication requiring extensive medical assistance)
Lack of sleep (temporary, as long as sleep habits are corrected)
Low blood sugar (temporary, as long as snacks or juice are given)
Low oxygen levels, including those caused by chronic lung disorders (may be temporary or permanent — requires immediate medical assistance)
Medication side effects (may be temporary, or may require a change in medication, dosage, or time of administration)
Nutritional deficiencies, commonly experienced when lacking niacin, thiamine, or vitamin B12
Seizures (may be temporary or may be permanent, depending on medical condition or circumstances causing seizures)
Stroke
Parkinson’s Disease
Advanced age
Sensory impairment
Sudden changes in body temperature, such as heat stroke or hypothermia (temporary if remedied quickly — if medical assistance is not administered as quickly as possible, sudden changes in body temperature may be fatal)

Wash your skin with antiseptic soap.,
Avoid tight clothing.,
Quit smoking.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Don't shave your body hair.,
Keep your groin area cool and clean.,
Avoid overheating.",How to Prevent Blocked Sweat Glands1," Use a gentle, non-irritating soap to wash your skin, focusing on areas that are most likely to be affected by blocked sweat glands. These areas include the groin, armpits, beneath the breast, and any other area of skin that folds against itself.Allow your skin to air-dry rather than rubbing dry with a towel.
Wash daily, or twice a day if necessary to maintain cleanliness.;
, Any clothing that presses or rubs against your skin increases your chances of developing blocked sweat glands. Wearing loose clothing of natural fibers, such as hemp, cotton or linen, is recommended to prevent blocked sweat glands.Underwire bras can block sweat glands beneath the breasts. Try to find a supportive bra that doesn't press tightly against your skin.
Tight waistbands can also block the sweat glands.

, Research shows that smoking increases your chances of developing HS, though the cause is currently unknown. Smoking is one of the key risk factors for HS. In order to prevent blocked sweat glands, try to quit smoking.If you need help to quit smoking, talk to your medical health provider or a local health organization.
Support groups, online groups, or individual coaches can help you quit smoking. Many companies have incentive programs to help their employees quit smoking. Keep trying until you find the one that works for you.

, HS is most common among people who are overweight or obese. To prevent blocked sweat glands, try to maintain a healthy body weight. If you're overweight, consider joining a weight loss program for encouragement and support in making lifestyle changes. Eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugary snacks and fatty foods, and eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit.Talk to your health care provider about weight loss support groups and dietary needs.
If you've already developed HS, losing weight can help prevent additional flareups.

, Shaving the armpits or groin can result in rubbing bacteria into the glands. If you want to eliminate hair in areas most likely to develop HS, talk to your doctor or dermatologist about options for hair removal.Wearing perfume or perfumed deodorants may also irritate the skin. Use unscented products designed for sensitive skin.
Because shaving the groin and armpits are culturally sensitive subjects, you may wish to talk to your doctor about finding support groups. Wearing concealing clothing is one way to navigate the social complexities of body hair.

, Wear cotton undergarments to improve air flow, and avoid tight clothing. Wearing synthetic fabric undergarments restricts air flow and increases the likeliness of blocked sweat glands.Wash groin daily or twice daily, depending on your individual needs. Use gentle antibacterial soap and allow to air dry.
Use lukewarm water to wash groin.

, Heavy sweating can cause sweat glands to become inflamed. Using saunas, hot tubs or steam rooms can cause sweating and blockage of sweat glands. Exercise in the early morning or evening hours, when the temperatures are lower. Don't do ""hot"" yoga, as this is designed to increase sweating.Antiperspirants can be too harsh for sensitive skin, resulting in blocked sweat glands. If you choose to wear an antiperspirant, check with your doctor for recommendations.
Exercise gently, without overheating.

Know the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).,
Apply warm compresses to the affected area.,
Wash your skin well with antibacterial soap.,
Take zinc supplements.,
Take antibiotics to address infections.,
Try steroid medications to reduce inflammation.,
Ask your doctor about tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors.,
Consider surgical treatment.",How to Prevent Blocked Sweat Glands2," The appearance of blackheads, pimples in the groin or anal area, beneath the breasts, or in the armpits can all be signs of HS. You might find painful, pea-sized lumps just beneath the skin. These lumps can persist for months or even years. Lesions - bumps or sores that leak fluid - may also be present and persist for months.These symptoms often start just after puberty with a single, painful bump.
Women, African-Americans, overweight, smokers and people with familial history of HS are most likely to develop the symptoms of HS.
Some people experience mild forms of HS that can be best treated at home. Others require help from a doctor or medical care provider.
HS affects at least 1% of the population.

, Laying a clean, warm washcloth over your skin for 10-15 minutes may help with pain associated with blocked sweat glands. If you have a painful, deep lump caused by a blocked sweat gland, this compress may provide some relief.You can also use a hot teabag as a compress. Make a cup of tea by steeping a teabag in boiling water. Then take the hot teabag and apply it to the affected area for pain relief.
The warmth will help relieve pain, but it won't get rid of the bump.

, Make sure to use a soap that doesn't irritate your skin. Find a fragrance-free soap that's designed for sensitive skin. Lather and rinse well. Allow your skin to air dry.You may wish to follow your washing with an over-the-counter antibiotic creme.
Avoid moisturizing creams, lotions, etc. as they may block your sweat glands and pores.

, Studies suggest that zinc supplements may help to decrease the chances of additional inflammation. Zinc supplements include zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc glycine, zinc oxide, zinc chelate, and zinc gluconate. These are generally considered safe when taken in the recommended dosages.While zinc appears safe during pregnancy in small amounts, check with your doctor and use with caution. Studies have not ruled out the possibility of harm to the fetus.
Avoid zinc chloride. No studies have been done on its safety or effectiveness.

, Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat existing infections and to prevent new infections from arising. Some antibiotics are prescribed for long-term preventative use.If there isn't bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed to suppress additional flare-ups.
Antibiotics can be taken orally, in pill form, or can be found in ointments to apply to the affected area.

, Corticosteroid tablets (steroids), such as prednisolone, may be prescribed for short periods of time. This option is most effective when the symptoms of HS are acutely painful, creating difficulty in daily living mobility.


Steroids shouldn't be used long-term, as they have negative side effects. Long-term side effects include osteoporosis, weight gain, cataracts, and mental health problems like depression.Injections of steroid medication into the affected area can also be effective for short-term treatment.

, A new class of injectable medications reduces inflammation and stop the progression of HS. These drugs include Infliximab (Remicade ®); Etanercept (Enbrel ®); Adalimumab (Humira ®); Golimumab (Simponi ®) and Golimumab (Simponi Aria ®).These medications are also used to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis), ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis.
Because they are new, these medications are expensive. Most insurance plans should cover them, but check to see if your policy allows their use.

, For severe cases of blocked sweat glands and HS, surgical treatment is a practical option. Lesions may be connected by ""tunnels"" beneath the skin, and removing these tunnels is called ""de-roofing."" This surgery is generally effective at removing the affected area, but other sites may develop.Surgical drainage of swollen area provides short-term relief.
Surgical removal of the skin in all affected areas may be recommended. In these cases, skin grafting will need to be done to repair the areas and close the wound.

Know that other systemic diseases can also be causes.,
Be aware that organ transplantation is a cause, too.,
Know that some cases of AVN are idiopathic.In cases when the disease presents itself without a known cause, it is considered idiopathic.",How to Prevent Avascular Necrosis," Preventing this condition requires treating the underlying conditions that cause it and managing the potential conditions from which it may arise. Generally, speaking AVN is a result of thrombosis, emboli, or general bone fractures.


Thrombosis, and emboli mostly arise post-operatively, or after fractures and prolonged immobilization of fractured limbs. They both can be prevented by proper rehabilitation, and, if necessary, administration of anti-coagulant therapy, such as heparin.Anticoagulant therapy is commonly indicated for patients who are at risk for thrombosis, and the two main groups of patients receiving this therapy are those with prolonged immobilization of fractured limbs, and those undergoing post-operative prevention.

;
, Bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density leading to increased bone strength and delay the progression of bone collapse. They are antiresorptive medicines, which means they slow the dissolving process. Most are taken by mouth.Common brand names of bisphosphonates are Fosamax, Boniva, Actonel, and Reclast. Some are taken once a day, once or twice a week, or even once a month.
Nevertheless, studies on the effects of bisphosphonates on AVN in humans is not conclusive. If ever, its use is for early-onset AVN.

, This is a solution you inhale 6-9 times a day for high blood pressure.It is a vasoactive compound, meaning it widens the diameter of blood vessels. It is used in the treatment of blocked arteries or lumens of a blood vessel and stops the clumping of platelets in order to avoid blood clotting. By increasing the diameter of blood vessels, iloprost helps in increasing blood flow to affected bones and joints, thus preventing AVN.Iloprost is useful only in early-onset and not in advanced forms of AVN.
Iloprost can decrease bone marrow edema in the acetabulum of the hip joint, the foot, and the femur (or hip) bone.
The side effects of Iloprost are severe headaches, nausea or feelings of vomiting, and a temporary increase in hip pain sensation.

, This can break down blood clotting in veins around the hip joint. However, do know that this drug is still experimental as studies on enoxaparin's effects on AVN has focused on AVN caused by steroids.Why does it work? There is less movement of blood through a limb suffering with AVN, and stasis of blood occurs. As a result, stasis is a risk for thrombosis (clot forming) inside the blood vessels. These drugs make sure that there is a reduced chance of formation of these blood clots.
Treatment is 60mg per day for 12 weeks.Talk you doctor about whether he or she thinks this is a viable treatment option for you.

, Lipitor and Zocor are two popular options. Statins protect against AVN due to steroids and are normally used to fight cholesterol. In addition, these can decrease bone marrow fat cell sizes and decrease pressure inside the femur head. Statins have shown positive effects on bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), too.


These are especially potent for those on steroids.But statins are widely used against cardiovascular problems across populations as well., Getting hyperbaric oxygen treatment is said to heal early-onset AVN after around six weeks of treatment. Studies on the use of hyperbaric oxygen on AVN patients show promising results but this treatment is still experimental.


This is where you enter a special, closed-off room and breathe only pure oxygen. The air pressure is generally three times higher than normal. The idea is that there is more oxygen in your body, promoting additional blood flow., There are more serious treatment programs you can think about as well. Ask your doctor about the following:


Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is promising for stage 1 or 2 (early onset) AVN but studies on this are still few or limited. Therefore, this treatment is still classified as experimental. ESWT causes increased formation of new blood vessels and helps in bone regeneration and remodeling (formation of previous bone structure).Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has some similar effects as ESWT such as increased formation of new blood vessels and bone tissue both in animal and human studies. This treatment is given for eight hours per day for a five-month average length of treatment.

, For patients who are taking glucocorticoids, whatever their condition is, it is very important to monitor their intake -- these medications can cause a plethora of side effects, including interfering with bone mass and bone strength. Glucocorticoids are one of the most commonly prescribed medications.


Almost a third of patients afflicted by AVN without a known cause (idiopathic), are linked to excessive glucocorticoid use. Thus, your physician should closely monitor your intake of these drugs, to prevent this specific side effect, but also many others.
They are used in numerous conditions - inflammatory, malignant, autoimmune, and in many skin conditions -- and their application is very diverse.

, Physical therapy methods and exercises must be started early on in the development of AVN. The use of crutches or other supportive devices must be used to avoid weight bearing on some affected joints like the hip joint. This is to avoid pressure on the affected bone and its blood supply.


Range of motion, muscle strengthening, and gait exercises are taught and provided by your physical therapist. Exercise will help increase blood flow to the affected joint, promoting healing of the bones of the joint and relieve pain. This is a very important part of prevention and treatment of AVN.

, When fixating the limb for immobilization, it is very important to properly position the fractured limb and all of its joints so that it can heal in an efficient way, but also prevent complications, like infection, hemorrhage, and more serious complications like thromboembolism.Depending on the location and severity of the fracture and the bone or joint affected, specific guidelines should be followed in order to maximize recovery and speed. Guidelines include the position of the limb, the amount of joints that need to be immobilized, the duration of fixation, etc.
If this procedure is not executed properly, and if the bone has regrown in a way that it shouldn’t, this can cause severe problems in rehabilitation, and significantly alter the course of recovery.
Rarely, but sometimes, a therapeutic solution can be “refracturing” the same bone or joint, so that it can grow back the way it should. It is very extreme, but sometimes proves to be the only solution. Thus, it is of extreme significance to immobilize the affected limb to avoid such complications.

, Well-planned rehabilitation following the removal of a cast, or any other form of immobilization, is imperative. After an adequate period of time for healing, movement and strength regaining exercises must be performed to return the strength of the muscles of the fractured limb.


After immobilization, the muscles of the fractured limb are very weak; proper strength regaining exercises are of utmost importance in order for the limb to be functional and useful as was before.
Your physician should give you all the necessary instructions during and after the rehabilitation process, in order to hasten recovery. These must be taken rather seriously, at least until the limb is mostly recovered.

, The Pavlik harness is an orthopedic contraption used for babies with DDH (hip dislocation). It flexes the legs upward, the knees to dangle downwards, and places the hips in a proper position, from birth to six months of age. This promotes proper hip development and lessens the likelihood of AVN in the hips. Nevertheless, the Pavlik harness is used only for certain types of DDH.


The brace must either be worn 24 hours a day or only removed when bathing; your doctor will know what's best for your scenario. It takes babies a few days to get used to it, sure, but in time they do.And, yes, they still wear diapers as normal.

, Surgical correction by the reduction of congenital or acquired hip dislocations by closed or open reduction is always an option if need be. If you're facing AVN in its advanced stages, this may be a wise decision. Talk to your doctor.


Reduction means to restore by surgery a bone fracture or dislocation to its correct position or alignment with respect to the other bones to which it should connect.

Open reduction means cutting through tissues to locate the bone and align it.
Closed reduction means there is no cutting through tissues and the bone is aligned correctly by external procedures.



, This includes fracture and surgery. When there is a thromb or an embolus, the same mechanism occurs as in a heart attack. In other words, there's a clog in the blood vessel in the bone, leading to a lack of blood flow, and, subsequently, to necrosis, and death of the tissue.


Fractures interrupt the arterial supply to the bone, and thus create a shortage of blood and nutrients, leading to the same outcome – necrosis, and, eventually, death of the tissue, if untreated.

, It has been found that previous administration of corticosteroidal drugs can be seen in 16-34% of those with “idiopathic” osteonecrosis (idiopathic meaning without known cause).It is also said that the risk for osteonecrosis increases with the increased duration of treatment and amount of glucocorticoids. However, it is still unclear how this mechanism triggers this condition.It is known, on the other hand, that these drugs interfere with bone density, and have been proven to cause the appearance of osteoporosis (decreased strength, and density of the bone) if used excessively., Osteonecrosis is a potential severe complication in people suffering from Sickle cell disease. The red blood cells in this condition are malformed, and due to their shape (like a sickle), they sludge together, and occlude blood vessels, and subsequently compromise blood flow through these vessels.As a result, infarcts and ischemia of the areas that are supplied by these blood vessels appears, and blood flow is compromised, thus leading to shortage of oxygen and valuable nutrients. With no oxygen, the tissues die.

, Similarly to patients with sickle cell disease, both conditions cause osteonecrosis via blood vessel occlusion. If an underlying cause present, that needs to be treated first and foremost. In certain cases, AVN is a symptom and not just a problem in and of itself.


In thrombosis, this is caused by a thromb (blood clot), and in the case of Vasculitis (a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation and damage of blood vessels), immune complexes made of antibodies directed to some of our own tissue are responsible for this condition.

, Diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Cushing’s Disease can also bring about AVN. If either of these are a battle for you, you're at a very high risk for AVN.


Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is an autoimmune disease, and the condition itself causes a form of vasculitis, which causes occlusion in the same mechanism mentioned above.
In Cushing’s Disease, due to excess cortisol, there is fat cell enlargement causing hypertension, and occlusion of the veins in the bone., This doesn't happen often, but occasionally an individual experiences an autoimmune reaction to the transplanted organ, resulting in an occlusion of blood vessels by these immune complexes (similarly to SLE). Subsequently, there is lack of blood flow into the tissue that is affected by this reaction.


Though it probably goes without saying by now, this lack of blood flow leads to AVN when there is no blood or oxygen in the bone or joint, leading to tissue death.

, All of the mentioned conditions should be taken into consideration. However, as we have mentioned above, almost a third of idiopathic presentations are due to excess glucocorticoid use.


As we can see, most conditions that cause osteonecrosis have a more or less a similar mechanism: Disruption and occlusion of blood flow through the blood vessels, due to diverse causes. Trust your doctor will run a series of test to pinpoint the problem.

See your doctor to discuss treatment options, including nutritional therapy.

, To ensure that you're getting sufficient iron, consider taking over the counter iron supplements. You can take this as a single supplement or part of a multivitamin, which may lessen your risk for developing anemia.You need anywhere from 8-18 mg of iron per day to keep your iron at normal levels. Consider taking slightly more if you are anemic or concerned about developing it.Women require more (up to 15-18 mg), because of menstruation. Pregnant women need at least 27 mg and lactating women 9-10 mg.
You can get iron supplements at most pharmacies and health food stores.

, Make sure that you get enough iron through nutritious, whole foods. Eating iron-rich foods can help prevent anemia.Meats and shellfish are an excellent source of iron. Red meats, such as lean beef or beef liver and shellfish, such as clams, oysters and shrimp are excellent choices.Beans and legumes, such as lentils and green peas are high in iron.Leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and collard greens contain high amounts of iron.Consider eating iron-fortified cereals for breakfast or a snack as a way to get more iron in your diet.All of the iron-rich animal products also contain Vitamin B12, which can also help prevent anemia., The presence of vitamin C and folate can help the body absorb iron more efficiently. Incorporating more foods containing Vitamin C and folate or taking a supplement for these nutrients can help minimize your risk for anemia.Foods such as peppers, kale, broccoli, citrus fruits, strawberries, pineapple, and spinach contain Vitamin C.You can get folate through many of the same foods including citrus fruits and dark, leafy greens. You can consume additional folate through bananas, fortified breads and cereals, and legumes.Consider taking Vitamin C and folate supplements or a multivitamin to help you get enough of these nutrients. Getting them through whole foods is preferable, but in some cases this is not possible., Consume whole foods that contain Vitamin B12, which is found naturally in animal and soy products. Making sure you get enough Vitamin B12 may not only help you prevent anemia, but can also help your body absorb iron more efficiently. Consider incorporating some or all of the following foods into your diet:Fish: try salmon, trout, and tuna
Shellfish: try clams and oysters
Eggs
Dairy products: try cheese and yogurt
Fortified cereals
Soy products: try soy milk, edamame, and tofu, If you're having trouble getting enough B12 or folate through food, consider taking pill supplements or getting a shot from the doctor. This may help you get plenty of Vitamin B12 and prevent you from developing anemia.It's very difficult to get enough B12 through supplements alone, so supplements should ideally be taken in conjunction with a diet high in vitamin B12.
You need .4 mcg to 2.8 mcg of B12 per day, depending on your age and if you are pregnant or nursing.You can get B12 supplements at most pharmacies and health food stores.
Folate, which is a B vitamin, is often combined with B12 in the same supplement. You can also find stand-alone folate or take it as part of a multivitamin.
Adults generally need 400 mcg. Pregnant women and lactating women will need more. The dose varies with younger ages.

, Your doctor can supplement Vitamin B12 with a gel or injection. You will need a prescription for both, so make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options.This is a good option if you are struggling to get B12 through food or over the counter supplements or you have a severe vitamin B12 deficiency.

, There is some evidence that using cast iron cookware can increase your iron intake. Consider investing in a cast iron skillet to help boost the amount of iron you consume in your diet.Small amounts of iron leach into food as it cooks, giving you a healthy, if small, dose of iron that doesn't affect the taste of your meals.This can be a useful trick if you don't like eating red meat.
A good cast iron skillet will last the rest of your life, so it's worth the small investment.

, Certain medications can make people more prone to developing anemia. If you're on medications that may put you at risk, ask your doctor whether there's an alternative medication that will do the job without causing you to become anemic. The following medications may lead to anemia:Cephalosporins
Dapsone
Levodopa
Levofloxacin
Methyldopa
Nitrofurantoin
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially if used frequently
Penicillin and its derivatives
Phenazopyridine (pyridium)
Quinidine"

Learn that some anemia cannot be treated with diet.,
Treat anemia by addressing underlying medical issues.,
Undergo treatment for anemia caused by blood diseases.",How to Prevent Anemia3," Unfortunately, some types of anemia are not preventable or treatable with diet. If you have an underlying medical issue or a blood disease that prevents your body from producing red blood cells, you won't be able to avoid anemia on your own. Seeking medical help to understand and treat the disease is the best way forward.Anemia that is not preventable can be congenital or caused by a number of conditions including: chronic disease, bone marrow disease, sickle cell and aplastic anemia, and thalassemia., Some diseases prevent the body from making the correct number of red blood cells. The most common of these is kidney disease.If you have a disease that makes you prone to anemia, consulting your physician for appropriate treatment is absolutely necessary.


If you have anemia from an intestinal condition such as Crohn’s or Celiac, you will need to speak to your doctor and develop an effective treatment plan.
If you have aplastic anemia or anemia caused by cancer, you may need a bone marrow transplant to help your body produce more red blood cells.If you have hemolytic anemia, you may need to avoid certain medications and take immunosuppressant drugs to boost your red blood cell count.Eating a lot of iron and avoiding situations that may cause injury could also help., In some cases, anemia is inherited in the form of a blood disease. Knowing that you or family members have the disease is the important first step to getting proper treatment and managing the condition.The following blood diseases cause anemia:


People suffering from sickle cell anemia have red blood cells shaped like sickles, which makes the cells prone to getting stuck in blood vessels and blocking blood flow. Sickle cell anemia can be very serious and very painful if not treated.Thalassemia causes the body to make less hemoglobin than normal, leading to anemia.Aplastic anemia causes the body to stop making enough new blood cells, including red blood cells. This can be caused by outside factors like certain cancer treatments, exposure to toxic chemicals, drugs, infections, and other causes."

No matter how botulism is contracted, it can lead to paralysis and even death. Knowing how it can be contracted is the first step to prevention. Here are the different types of botulism:


Foodbourne botulism occurs when someone eats food contaminated with bacteria.
Wound botulism occurs when the bacteria enters an open wound, and the body begins producing toxins as a result. This is more likely to occur for those working in dirty conditions or those who share drug needles.Infant botulism occurs when an infant ingests the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release a toxin.
Adult intestinal botulism occurs when an adult ingests the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which grow in the intestines and release a toxin.
Botulism is not contagious; however, people who eat the same food that is contaminated will likely have the same reaction. This may lead some people to think it can be ""caught"" from another person.;
, Unfortunately, not all types of botulism can be prevented. Foodbourne botulism and botulism that enters an open would are preventable, but infant and intestinal botulism aren't. Here's what you need to know:


Foodbourne botulism can be prevented by taking proper precautions with food preparation.
Wound botulism can be prevented by properly cleansing and treating an open wound right away. Avoid it by never injecting or inhaling street drugs.
Infant botulism and intestinal botulism are caused by bacterial spores that live in dirt. No matter how clean you keep your house, or how much you keep your baby from playing outside in dirt, there's no way to prevent these spores from entering the body. The good news is that botulism is extremely rare, and isn't fatal when it's promptly treated., The symptoms of botulism can appear as early as six hours after consuming tainted food, and as late as ten days later. Botulism can be fatal if it isn't treated promptly. If you experience any of the following symptoms and suspect botulism, see a doctor immediately. Here are the most common signs of botulism:


Double vision, blurred vision or drooping eyelids
Slurred speech
Difficulty swallowing or dry mouth
Muscle weakness

, Most cases of botulism occur in infants, so it's very important to monitor your baby for the symptoms.If your baby exhibits any of the following signs of the paralysis that occurs with botulism, go to the emergency room immediately:


Appearance of lethargy
Unable to eat
Cries weekly
Has weak movements

, Botulism is most likely to be caused by consuming improperly preserved or handled food. Example of when the bacteria might exist in food include:Fish that has been pickled without enough salinity or acidity in the brine to kill off the bacteria
Smoked fish stored at too high a temperature
Fruits and vegetables that lack high enough acid content to kill off bacteria
Any canned food that hasn't been canned according to modern, standard practice
Honey products for any person under the age of one and for anyone whose immune system is somehow compromised

, Each time you cook a meal, be sure to prepare the food in a way that's safe and sanitary. The following lists some of the basic kitchen hygiene practices that you should follow each and every time:


Wash dirt from your fruits and vegetables. Botulinum bacteria resides in soil, and any food that still has dirt on it can present a hazard.
Scrub potatoes clean before baking. Potatoes that have been wrapped and cooked in aluminum foil should be kept hot until they are eaten or refrigerated.
Clean mushrooms before using, to remove soil.
Consider boiling home canned foods for 10 minutes before eating them.
Refrigerate homemade salsa and cheese sauces should be refrigerated.
Refrigerate anything made from dairy.
Discard heat-treated food containers where their air-tight state appears compromised, such as food cans with pinprick holes or rust.
And in case you're roaming or living outdoors, avoid eating old roadkill or beached sea creatures. You don't know how long these creatures have been lying about for and the bacteria may have a good hold on them.

, Sometimes people get botulism from eating packaged food that's been contaminated. Knowing when not to eat packaged or prepared food is a very important way to prevent botulism. Botulism spores themselves don't have a taste or smell, so don't rely on smell alone to decide if something is safe.If canned food is dented, partially opened, or in any way misshapen, don't eat the food inside it.
If canned food fizzes, bubbles or smells bad when opened, discard it.
If the lid pops off too easily, discard the food.
If food smells off, unless you know it is meant to have a foul odor, discard it (in a few cases, some edible fermented or long-stored food products naturally smell terrible to most people but these foods are rare).
If there is mold on or strange discoloration of the food, discard it.
If in any doubt, always throw it out. It's not worth the risk.

, At this young age, children's immune system hasn't developed enough to kill botulism bacteria that can sometimes grow in honey. Adults have immune systems strong enough to handle it.

, Over the past 20 or so years, the home preserving and canning techniques have received an overhaul in light of modern understandings of bacteria and preserving foods. This means that books or recipes within this era should be able to provide you with safe guidelines and processes.


Just because it's on the internet doesn't mean it's modernized. Old recipes abound online just as they do in old books! Check the source and ask questions. If in doubt, skip to a source you can actually verify as being up-to-date.
It may be possible to update an old preserving recipe by cross-checking with modern versions. The parts the old recipe is missing (many things were not said because cooks in former times knew by repetition what to do) may be fixable by inserting the missing steps considered crucial for safety.

, Acidity destroys the botulinum bacteria. When there is a reduced level of acid, or none at all, the risk of the bacteria thriving increases. In particular, many vegetables do not lend themselves well to canning processes without having the ability to heat them to a very high temperature.


Some of the low-acid vegetables that are commonly grown in the garden and that it may be tempting to can include asparagus, green beans, tomatoes, chile peppers, beets, carrots (juice) and corn.
It is possible to can these but only if you have equipment that allows you to heat the jars beyond the boiling point of water. This requires a specialty canner that acts like a large pressure cooker. If you do purchase one, read its instructions with great care and follow them very closely to make sure that you get it right.

, Alcohol, brine and sugar syrup will kill bacteria. In the case of brine and sugar syrup, these must be combined with heating, which is what kills the microorganisms. As well as killing bacteria, these bases will also kill viruses, fungi and mold.


Acidifying low-acid foods will help to kill bacteria but heating should still be incorporated into the process. Thus, lemon juice, citric acid, vinegar and other acidic elements can be used to increase the acidity of preserved foods that are being preserved using a heating method.

, As already noted, even sea level boiling temperature is inadequate for low-acid foods (botulism bacteria can survive temperatures in excess of 212ºF/100ºC). For foods where acid is present, however, heat will destroy the bacteria in combination with the acidity. Standard modern canning techniques include:


The pan method: Canning jars are washed and sterilized by being submerged in boiling water for five minutes. Jars are then filled with fruit and rubber seals that have been wet in the boiling water are added to the mouth of the jar before adding the lid. The jars are then returned to the pan to be simmered for the time required by the recipe.
The oven method: The oven is preheated, fruit is placed into jars and the lids placed loosely on the top of the jars. The jars are placed in the oven on a tray or baking sheet and cooked for a set time (according to the recipe). They are removed from the oven, filled with boiling brine or syrup, sealed tightly and left to cool.

, This is essential for destroying the spores that may be present. As with low-acid vegetables, this will require the use of a pressure canner that is capable of raising the temperature this high or higher.


In addition, heat any canned meat product to 212ºF/100ºC after opening. Then reduce the heat and simmer for at least 15 minutes before being satisfied that the bacteria has been destroyed.<

, Canning is an art form that requires a lot of effort and care. If this isn't of interest to you, there are still safe ways to store a glut of produce, including:


Freezing food: Be sure to read up on the food type in question, as each food has specific freezing needs, while some foods won't survive the freezing process at all.
Drying food: Drying kills bacteria, yeasts, fungi and enzymes. Again, follow modern instructions to get this right.
Vinegar: Some foods can be stored in vinegar. This is often used for pickles, with spices added to improve flavors.
Smoking: Some foods, such as meat and fish, can be smoked.
Wine, cider, beer or spirits: Turn your fruit and vegetables into alcohol and the bacteria will certainly depart.

, Any food might be contaminated if it grows in soil or has been contact with soil. It is still safe to preserve using oil, but use the precautions explained the following steps.Wash the produce well before using. Remove all traces of dirt. If peeling is the only way to ensure this, then consider peeling it.
Add an acidifying agent. This is required by law in the USA, for all commercial preparations of infused oils. Typical acidifying agents available in the home environment include lemon juice, vinegar and citric acid. The ratio is one tablespoon of acidifying agent to one cup of oil.
Refrigerate any infused oil. If you have a very cold, dark cellar, this might be sufficient provided it stays very cold but to be on the safe side, refrigeration will generally allow for longer keeping of infused oil.
Discard the oil immediately if it starts to look cloudy, bubbly, or has a foul odor.

Talk with your doctor.,
Discuss your medications.,
Refrain from certain activities.,
Ask your doctor for instructions.,
Drink enough water.,
Warm your extremities.,
Talk to the phlebotomist.",How to Prepare for a Blood Test1," You need to know about the specific blood tests your doctor is ordering. Some blood tests will require special preparation to get accurate results. Some examples of common blood tests which require special preparation include:


Glucose tolerance tests, which require fasting prior to coming to the lab. You also have to remain at the lab for up to 5 hours and your blood is taken every 30 to 60 minutes.
Fasting Glucose test, which is done after you have not eaten or had anything to drink except water for 8 to 12 hours. These tests are often first thing in the morning so you aren’t asked to go without eating all day.
Serum Lipid testing, also called a cholesterol test, which will sometimes require you to fast for 9 to 12 hours before the test.Cortisol blood test, where you are asked to refrain from exercising the day before, lie down for 30 minutes before the test, and refrain from eating or drinking for 1 hour before the test.;
, There are certain substances that can alter blood tests, which you may need to stop before your blood test. Prescription medications, recreational drugs, alcohol intake, vitamins, blood thinners, or over-the-counter medications can often change the results of a blood test, depending on what the blood test is for.Your physician can determine if you should wait 24 to 48 hours to have the blood work done or if what you have taken will not significantly alter the blood test results.

, There are some blood tests that can be compromised based on your activities. These tests can be altered by recent physical activity or heavy exercise, undergoing dehydration, smoking, drinking herbal teas, or sexual activity.


You might be asked to refrain from some of these activities prior to taking a blood test., Many tests do not require special preparation prior to getting your blood drawn. However, when in doubt, ask. If your physician does not give you any special instructions, it is important that you ask in order to reduce the potential that you arrive for the test without preparing sufficiently., Being sufficiently hydrated makes the blood draw easier. The veins will be bigger and easier to find and the blood is not as thick and flows into the tube easier. If you need to fast from water as well, be sure you are very hydrated from the day before.


This may mean needing to get up during the night to urinate. However, being well hydrated will make your blood test easier., Before you get ready to take a blood test, warm the extremity where the blood will be drawn. Use a warm compress over the area for 10 to 15 minutes to improve the blood flow to that area.


Wear warmer than normal clothes for the season when you go in to get your blood drawn. This increases your skin temperature, increases the blood flow to the area, and makes it easier for the phlebotomist (the person who draws your blood)to find a good vein., If you deviated from the instructions given to you to prepare for the blood test prior to having your blood drawn, you need to notify the person who will draw your blood when you arrive. If the deviation is significant enough to alter the results of the test, you may have to return to have the blood test drawn another day.Mention if you are allergic to latex or latex sensitive. Latex is in many types of gloves and band-aids, which are used while taking blood. Some people have an allergy or sensitivity to latex which can be life threatening. If you know that you have either an allergy or sensitivity, it is important to notify both your doctor and the phlebotomist so they can use latex-free equipment."

Stabilize your stress.,
Recognize your fears.,
Ask about EMLA.,
Understand how the procedure starts.,
Know how the blood is drawn.",How to Prepare for a Blood Test2," Blood tests can increase your stress level or anxiety when you are nervous about the test. Unfortunately, becoming stressed increases your blood pressure, constricts your veins, and makes getting your blood drawn more difficult.Knowing how to reduce your stress can help improve your preparation for the test and increase the likelihood that the phlebotomist will find the vein the first time.
You could try deep breathing exercises or repeating a calming phrase, such as ""This will be over very soon. Plenty of people have blood drawn. I can handle this."" Look at the ""Stress Reduction Techniques"" section of this article for more tips.

, Before you go to the doctor to have your blood taken, recognize that you might be anxious about having your blood drawn. You may also have a fear of needles. Between three and 10 percent of the population has a fear of needles (Belonephobia) or a fear of all injections (Trypanophobia).Interestingly, 80% of people with a phobia of needles report that they have a first-degree relative also has a strong fear of needles. It's possible this fear is partially genetic.

, If you have had your blood drawn before and know that it is particularly painful for you, ask your doctor for EMLA. This is a topical anesthetic which is put on the draw site between 45 minutes to 2 hours before the blood draw to numb the area.


If you know that you are susceptible to pain, ask if EMLA is an option for you.EMLA is commonly used for children, but it is much less common for use by adults because it takes so long to work.You can also ask about ""Numby Stuff,"" a proprietary topical preparation that includes a combination of lidocaine and epinephrine and a mild electrical current to numb an area. It works in about 10 minutes., To feel better mentally about having blood drawn, you need to understand the procedure. The phlebotomist will wear gloves to reduce exposure to your blood. She will usually place an elastic band around your arm above the elbow and have you make a fist. During a typical blood test, blood is usually drawn from a vein in your arm or a finger prick.


The elastic band expands the amount of blood in this area of the arm as blood is able to come into the arm through the arteries which are deeper in the arm, but not as much blood is able to be pumped out of the arm. This increases the size of the veins, making them easier to find and stick., The blood is drawn in similar ways, no matter where you get it done. A needle will go into your vein, which is usually attached to a small tube. When there is enough blood the tube, the tube is taken off, which seals automatically.


If more tubes are required, the needle remains in place and another tube is put on the end of the needle. Once all the tubes needed for your blood tests are filled, the phlebotomist will remove the needle and put a small gauze over the area. She will ask you to put pressure on the area while they prepare the tubes to go to the laboratory.
You may have a band-aid placed over the gauze to help the area to stop bleeding.
The whole process usually takes 3 minutes or less."
"
Breathe deeply.,
Accept that you are anxious.,
Recognize that your mind is playing tricks on you.,
Ask yourself questions.,
Use positive self-talk.",How to Prepare for a Blood Test3," If you are having a hard time with the idea of getting your blood drawn, you need to relax. Take a deep breath and focus all of your attention on breathing. Deep breathing activates the body’s relaxation response. Inhale slowly to the count of four and then exhale slowly to the count of four., Anxiety is just a feeling like any other feeling. Feelings only have control when you give them control. When you accept that you are anxious you take the power away from the feeling. If you try to get rid of the feeling it becomes overwhelming., Anxiety is a trick of the mind that has real physical consequences. Enough anxiety can produce a panic attack, which can mimic a heart attack. When you understand that your anxiety, no matter how little or big, is little more than a trick of the mind it helps reduce the pressure and responsibility of caring for yourself. , When you are anxious, ask yourself several questions to determine exactly how bad the situation really is. Anxiety can increase the number of outrageous ideas you’re having while asking yourself specific questions that require realistic answers can increase your awareness. Ask yourself questions such as:


What is the worst thing that can happen when they draw my blood?
Is what I’m worried about realistic? Can it really happen to me?
What is the likelihood that the worst thing will happen? , You will hear what we say to yourselves, even when you don’t think that you do. Talking out loud and repeating that you are strong, can handle the situation, and that nothing bad will happen will help to reduce your feelings of anxiety.

"
Eat a snack.,
Ask how long you’ll wait for results.,
Notice a bruise.,
Ask about a possible result complications.,
Discuss hemolysis with the phlebotomist.",How to Prepare for a Blood Test4," If you were required to fast prior to the blood test, you’ll want to bring a snack for after the test. Also bring a bottle of water and a snack that doesn’t require refrigeration. This will tide you over until you are able to eat a meal.


Peanut butter crackers, a peanut butter sandwich, a handful of almonds or walnuts, or whey protein are all easy to transport and will give you some protein and calories until you can get a meal.
If you forgot to bring anything to eat, ask the staff where you have had blood drawn. They may keep cookies or crackers around for just this purpose.

, Some tests can be finished within 24 hours while others can take a week or more if the blood must be shipped to a special laboratory. Talk with your doctor about the process used to deliver the results of the blood test. In some cases the office will not notify you if the results are all within normal limits. If the blood is sent off, also ask how long it will be before the office gets the results from the laboratory.


Ask to be notified, even if the results are normal. This will ensure that your results don’t ""fall through the cracks"" and you aren’t notified if the results are not normal.
Call the doctor’s office 36 to 48 hours after the results should have arrived if you are not notified.
Ask your doctor’s office if they use an online notification system. You may be given a website to register through so your results can be delivered digitally to you.

, The most common side effect to having blood drawn is a bruise, or hematoma, at the site where the needle went in. The bruise can show up immediately or within 24 hours after the blood was drawn. Some of the factors that contribute to the formation of a hematoma include blood leaking out of the opening when a needle goes through a vein, which leaks into the surrounding tissue. They can also be caused by bleeding disorders or anticoagulant medications, which increases the risk that a bruise or hematoma will occur where the blood is drawn.


Applying pressure over the area where the blood was drawn for five minutes, which is longer than necessary to stop the area from bleeding to the outside, will often help to reduce the risk of a hematoma, or a collection of blood outside of a blood vessel.Hemophilia is the most well-known bleeding disorder, but it is also fairly rare. It comes in two forms - A & B.
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common bleeding disorder, and affects how your blood clots.Patient should let there doctor and phlebotomist know they have a bleeding disorder when they get there blood drawn.

, There are certain situations that can lead to inaccurate results on your blood tests. Prolonged tourniquet application can lead to a pooling of blood in the arm or extremity where the blood was being drawn. This increases the concentration of blood and increases the potential for false positive or negative results on the blood tests.


The tourniquet should be in place for no longer than one minute to prevent pooling, also called hemoconcentration.
If longer than a minute is needed to locate a choice vein, then the tourniquet should be released and reapplied after two minutes and only immediately before the needle is inserted., Hemolysis is a problem with the blood sample and not a complication which you experience. Hemolysis happens when the red blood cells rupture and other components spill into the blood serum. Hemolyzed blood is not acceptable for testing and another blood sample will have to be drawn. Hemolysis is more likely to occur when:


The tube is mixed vigorously after being removed from the needle.
Drawing blood from a vein near a hematoma.
Using a smaller needle which damages the cells as they are drawn into the tube.
Excessive fist clenching during the blood draw.
Leaving the tourniquet on for more than one minute.

Eat more iron.,
Avoid iron absorbing substance.,
Incorporate more vitamin B12.,
Try foods with extra folate.,
Get more vitamin C. Your body needs vitamin C to make healthy red blood cells, which is the main factor in preventing anemia.,
Take supplements if necessary.,
Seek medical advice.",How to Prevent Anemia Naturally1," The most common anemias are nutritional deficiency anemias. Iron is the most common nutritional deficiency seen in anemia patients.To prevent this kind of anemia, you need to include certain kinds of foods in your diet to get more iron. Men and non-menstruating women should get about 10 mg of iron daily, while menstruating or nursing mothers should get 15 mg daily. Pregnant women should get 30 mg every day.


Try to incorporate more iron-rich proteins such as lean red meat, liver, poultry, pork, and fish. Try more spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables, such as Swiss chard, mustard, beet and collard greens, broccoli, various lettuces, and kale.
Also eat more tofu and other soybean foods, peas, lentils, various colored beans, chickpeas, dried fruits, prunes, raisins, apricots, and prune juice.
For breakfast or a snack, try iron-fortified cereals and iron-fortified whole grain breads.
You can also cook in cast-iron cookware to get additional iron.;
, Certain foods can decrease iron absorption. If you want to prevent iron deficiency anemia, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with meals. They will absorb the much needed iron from your meal and it will not go into your body. You should also not take your iron supplement with these liquids as well for the same reason.


You should also avoid milk and dairy products because the calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption., To prevent the kind of anemia where you need more vitamin B12, bring more vitamin B12 into your diet. You need 2.5 mcg of B12 every day. Pregnant women should get 2.6 mcg per day and if nursing, you need 2.8 mcg every day. Include vitamin B12 rich foods such as beef, liver, poultry, sardines, salmon, tuna, cod, eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese. These all have natural vitamin B12 that will help up your levels and help your anemia.


You can also eat food that has been fortified with vitamin B12. Try breakfast cereals, soy-based beverages, and vegetarian burgers with added vitamin B12.
You can also take a vitamin B12 supplement to help increase your levels as well., You can also get anemia from a deficiency in vitamins such as folate. To prevent this, incorporate more folate rich foods into your diet. Men over 13 years old should have 400 mcg of folate per day. Women over 13 should have 4-600 mcg per day. To get more folate, eat foods such as spinach, beet and collard greens, Swiss chard, broccoli, mustard, lettuces, kale, lentils, black-eyed peas, pinto beans, chickpeas, kidney beans, beef liver, and eggs.


You can get foods that have been fortified with extra folate, such as bread, pasta, and rice.
There are also good amounts of folate in fruit and fruit juices, such as bananas, oranges, and orange juice., Adults over 19 should need to get a minimum of 85 mg of Vitamin C daily. If you are a smoker, you should get an extra 35 mg daily. If you want to boost your immunity, you need a dosage of 1000 mg. To get enough vitamin C, eat fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, limes, kiwi fruit, papaya, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, and cantaloupe.


There are also many vitamin C rich vegetables, such as broccoli, red peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables.
Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron, so the vitamin C containing foods can be taken with the iron containing foods., It is always best to get your vitamins and minerals from foods. If you eat foods rich with the vitamins, for the most part, they should provide you with all the vitamins and minerals you need. If you worry that you might not be getting enough from your food intake, you can take a supplement of iron, vitamin B12, vitamin C, folate, or any other vitamin or mineral.


Just because something is natural or required by the body does not mean you can’t overdo it. Iron is a good example. There is a condition called hemochromatosis that can be hereditary or acquired and occurs when you take too much iron as a supplement. It can be very serious., If you are not sure what type of anemia you may be susceptible to, you may need to seek medical advice as you start your natural treatments. There are many forms of anemia and there can be serious consequences if anemia is handled incorrectly. You should be careful because, with certain forms of anemia, extra vitamins and minerals can actually make your condition worse.


Before you can prevent anemia, you have to understand if you are at risk for it."

Stop the session if your toddler really wants to get up and play.",How to Prepare a Child for a Reflexology Session2," Your toddler is more likely to become a willing participant in a reflexology session if he/she sees it as a fun activity. Consider, for example, suggesting that the two of you massage the feet or paws of your toddler’s favorite stuffed animals or dolls.

, Let him know it is a pleasant experience for you. Most toddlers love to please their parents.

, Make the whole session fun.

, Play soft music, lower the lights and try to have each reflexology session at the same time of the day. Toddlers love routines and when they see and hear reflexology cues, they will be more likely to cooperate.

, The last thing you want is for your toddler to think of reflexology as a punishment or as a stifling activity.

"
"
Let your child observe you apply reflexology to yourself or to another adult in the family, ideally a favorite uncle or aunt.,
Explain to your child how reflexology can help with illness and injuries in a natural way.,
Give your child examples of how reflexology has helped you or others you know.

,
Get books about reflexology at your local library and encourage your child to look through them.

,
Show your child foot reflexology charts so he/she can see the correlation between the reflex points on his/her feet and the areas on his/her body that are affected by applying pressure to those points.

,
Explain to your teenager that reflexology can help with hormonal changes, growing pains and even acne.",How to Prepare a Child for a Reflexology Session3," A child who sees someone he/she greatly admires getting a reflexology treatment, is more likely to want to have the same experience.

, Most children would rather have a ""foot massage"" than a spoonful of bitter medicine.

,,,, Some teens are more receptive to the idea of reflexology if they realize they will reap a benefit, especially a visual benefit like clearer skin.

Know if you are at risk.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Treat anemia medically.",How to Prevent Anemia Naturally2," You only need to prevent anemia if you are at risk of developing anemia. There are a number of risk factors for anemia. Some anemias that are preventable while others, such as the hereditary or genetic anemias, cannot be prevented. Risk factors for anemia include nutritional deficiencies that arise from a diet lacking in the vitamins and minerals needed by the bone marrow. The bone marrow produces red blood cells and a deficiency of necessary vitamins and minerals for the bone marrow causes the production of red blood cells to decrease. The major vitamins and minerals needed are vitamin C, riboflavin, B12, folate, iron, and copper. A deficiency anemia can also arise if you are overweight or obese.Intestinal conditions, such as Crohn’s and celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bowel disease, and leaky gut syndrome, as well as other chronic diseases can prevent the absorption of nutrients and put you at risk for anemia. Women are at risk during their menstrual cycles and pregnancy because of the significant loss of blood or a lack of absorption of iron during these high stress times.If you have chronic blood loss because of a bleeding ulcer or if you use certain medications, such as high-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs like Naprosyn, Advil and others, you may be more susceptible to anemia.Your medical background can play a part. A number of anemias are passed down in families and cannot be prevented. You can also get anemia if you have a personal history of alcoholism, certain viral infections, liver disease, exposure to toxic chemicals, or a history of certain medications. , Even if you try your best to prevent it, you should know the symptoms just in case you start to develop them. This way, you can increase your preventative measures to reverse the early stages of anemia. The symptoms of anemia can vary depending on the specific form you have. However, there are some symptoms that are general to most cases. These include fatigue, general feelings of weakness, pale skin, rapid or irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, confusion, memory loss, cold hands and feet, and headaches.


If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your physician to determine the cause. The symptoms of anemia can apply to many other conditions as well. To get the proper treatment, you need to get a medical diagnosis., Despite your best efforts of preventing anemia, there may come a time when you need medical attention to help prevent, reverse, or deal with your anemia. The treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the anemia. Vitamin and mineral deficiency anemias are treated with dietary changes and supplementation. In the case of pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 is replaced by intramuscular injection. For anemias due to blood loss during menstruation, hormone treatments may be considered. For anemias due to autoimmune disorders, immunosuppressant drugs may be used.


Blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant may be performed in severe and rare cases of anemia. If the anemia is due to internal bleeding, surgery may be required to stop the bleeding.
Sickle cell anemia is treated with oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, blood transfusions, or supplements. Antibiotics are also prescribed to treat concurrent infections which may set off a sickle cell crisis."

Determine what your triggers are.,
Get plenty of sleep each night.,
Consume more water to remain hydrated.,
Reduce the amount of stress you experience.,
Exercise.,
Use cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques.,
Use mind-body therapy approaches.",How to Naturally Ease Symptoms of Epilepsy1," Seizures can be triggered by missing medication, lack of sleep, bright lights, fever, hormonal changes and hormonal cycles, stress, alcohol and drug abuse, low blood sugar, caffeine, and some medications.In addition, some anti-epileptic medications can change hormone levels. If your seizures are triggered by your cycle, they may be what are called catamenial epilepsy and may reflect decreased fertility during that month. Talk to your neurologist to determine the best approach to this form of epilepsy.Some people have very specific and unique triggers. You can keep a seizure diary and try to determine what, if any, triggers are critical for you. Record all your seizures, noting the time of day and any situation surrounding the seizure. Also record any sensations (tastes, odors, sights, pain, pressure) that you experienced around the seizure. This can help you and your neurologist narrow down possible triggers.;
, Lack of sleep or disrupted sleep can increase the frequency of seizures.Teenagers are particularly at risk. Practice good sleep hygiene by following these tips from the National Sleep Foundation (NSF):Avoid taking naps. Naps can disturb normal sleep patterns.
Avoid stimulants. This includes caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol too near bedtime.
Get enough exercise.
Avoid large meals near bedtime and eat dinner two hours or longer before sleeping.
Get out into the sun. Sunlight helps maintain the cycle of melatonin, the sleep hormone.
Establish a regular routine or ritual. Set out your pajamas, wash or bathe, read (not in bed), meditate or pray—whatever you prefer to set the routine.
Try to leave your problems at the bedroom door
Associate your bed with sleep. Don’t watch TV, listen to the radio, bring a laptop, or read.

, Try to drink eight glasses of water a day. Sodium and potassium—the electrolytes—help to carry electrical signals to cells. An imbalance of these electrolytes may lead to seizures.Therefore, it is essential to keep your body hydrated.

, Stress affects not just your sleep, but it can also increase your frequency of seizures.The American Psychological Association (APA) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the following steps to help reduce stress:Taking a break from the stressor—even twenty minutes can make a big difference.
Exercising. That twenty-minute break is a great time to go for a walk or run, and it can make a difference in stress levels that lasts for hours.
Getting social support. Call, text, or email a friend. Take a few minutes to smile and laugh.
Meditating. Meditation, yoga, and prayer have shown similar results as exercise in studies as a way to reduce stress for hours.

, Exercise such as walking, swimming, jogging, and cycling have been shown to reduce the number of seizures experienced.Simply increasing your physical activity can also reduce the frequency of your seizures.


You can practice simple things like parking your car further away from the store or walking your dog two to three times a day.
You can get a yoga, tai chi, or other fitness video and work at your own speed and time. Any increase in activity will be of benefit, and the more you are active, the better.
Studies have shown that exercise can also improve the psychological status of those with epilepsy.There have traditionally been recommendations to avoid some sports, so talk to your physician about which activities beyond those described are right for you.

, A relatively new approach using psycho-behavioral therapy is becoming more recognized as a form of therapy for epilepsy. One of the approaches in this therapy includes cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques.The CBT approaches include techniques such as:


Conditioning, which is a learning process where specific behaviors are increased or decreased with positive and negative reinforcement.Aura interruption, which can be useful in reducing the frequency of seizures in those who experience visual, auditory, or odor-based auras.EEG biofeedback, which is a training method where the person with epilepsy is trained to monitor and respond to their own realtime EEGs.Systematic desensitization, which is where a person is exposed to progressively greater triggering stimuli and taught how to relax through it., Mind-body approaches are often used in conjunction with CBT techniques and have shown positive effects on enhancing mood and well-being.Yoga, deep breathing, and meditation can be effective mind-body approaches to epilepsy."

See a nutritionist.,
Discuss the ketogenic diet with your nutritionist.,
Discuss the “modified” Atkins diet with your nutritionist.,
Increase the amount of zinc you get each day.",How to Naturally Ease Symptoms of Epilepsy2," Some seizures can be controlled with special diets, but these should only be used while working with a nutritionist. Discuss taking mineral and vitamin supplements with your neurologist and nutritionist, especially if you are taking antiepilepsy medications, which may deplete specific nutrients, particularly those needed for bone and heart health., This diet entails eating primarily high-fat foods and very few carbohydrates. The diet must also be carefully calculated and monitored, which requires initial fasting and a hospital stay for observation.The diet is often used to help treat childhood epilepsy.Allowed calories, fluids, and proteins are calculated based on the current weight of the patient and a meal plan can be developed based on the specific form of epilepsy and the age of the child.


This diet pushes the body to use fats (instead of carbs) as its main energy source.
Potential long-term effects of the diet include kidney stones, high cholesterol, slowed growth, and weight gain.This is why it is important to work closely with your doctor and nutritionist while on this diet.

, The modified Atkins diet has been shown in recent studies to reduce the rate of seizures in almost half of all adults that try it.It is also a low-carb, high-fat diet, but it is tailored to adults and requires no fasting, calorie counting, or hospital stays like the ketogenic diet.However, intake is still based on your weight and other factors, so you must consult a nutritionist.


The diet was developed at Johns Hopkins in 2002 with the specific purpose of helping to treat epilepsy.Those who switch to the diet typically see results within a few months.Recommended fats include bacon, eggs, mayonnaise, butter, hamburger, heavy whipping cream, and oils such as canola and olive oils. Carbohydrates are restricted (10-20g/day), though not as severely as they are with the ketogenic diet.

, Zinc tends to be deficient in those suffering from epilepsy.Hence, it would be helpful to include foods rich in zinc to your diet, namely nuts, legumes, and seafood.

Consult your doctor before trying any herbal options.,
Try taking bacopa.,
Use chamomile.,
Ask your doctor about taking kava.,
Try taking valerian.,
Use passionflower.,
Avoid herbs that can increase seizures or counteract other epilepsy medications.,
Avoid essential oils that can exacerbate epilepsy symptoms.",How to Naturally Ease Symptoms of Epilepsy3," Whether consumed as a tea or a supplement, you should always consult your doctor before adding an herbal remedy to your treatment regimen. Your doctor will be able to check if the herb can interact with any other medications you’re taking, as well as inform you of any potential side effects from the herb., This herb has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine. Some studies have shown that bacopa might decrease the frequency of seizures. Use with caution if you have a history of lung, kidney, or bladder conditions., You can use chamomile as a sedative to reduce stress-related seizures. Ensure that you consult a doctor about finding the right dosage because it can amplify the effects of other sedatives and interact with a number of other medications., This herb has also traditionally been used as a sedative to reduce seizures.Kava can interact with a variety of other drugs, and it may also cause liver damage, so only take it while regularly following up with your doctor to test your liver function.Do not take kava at all if you suffer from Parkinson’s disease., This herb has both anticonvulsive and sedative properties.As with many other herbs, it can interact with other medications (as well as alcohol), so consult your doctor before taking it.This herb is combined with lemon balm, which is another herb that has displayed sedative effects., Passionflower is a very mild sedative and research is promising, but has been done primarily in mice and rats.Passionflower can interact with sedatives, causing increased sleepiness., In addition to a number of herbs that may help reduce symptoms, a variety of others have been shown to either increase the frequency of seizures of interact with anti-epilepsy medications. These include:Ginkgo
Ginseng
GLA (a fatty acid found in evening primrose oil and borage oil)
St. John’s wort
White willow
Ephedra
Mate

Prepare yourself for discomfort.,
Make sure you follow any and all post-op instructions, such a as physiotherapy, weight-bearing restrictions and bracing/wrapping.",How to Prepare for Knee Arthroscopy Surgery (Teens)," You might have to stop taking medications such as NSAIDs up to two weeks before your surgery. You will also want to know how long before your procedure you must fast. It is often from midnight the night before surgery on, but there are exceptions, so be sure to go over this with your surgeon.
, This may include a brace/immobilizer, an ice machine/ice packs, pillows and blankets for comfort in the car on the way home from the hospital, or a prescription for pain meds (some surgeons will give you the prescription ahead of time, others will only give it on the day of surgery).,, If you are in school, try to get your homework ahead of time so you can do it before your surgery. If you can't do this for one reason or another (such as surgery being booked for the next day, it does happen), try to email your teachers at least, and this way they will hopefully give you an extension on the work being done on your surgery day, and potentially for a few days after your surgery (in case you need to stay out of town overnight, or are in too much pain to go back the day after)., Especially in rural areas, there may not be an orthopaedic surgeon in your town/city, so you may have to stay in a hotel before and/or after your surgery, especially if you need to have a drain removed the morning after surgery. Make sure to ask for a medical rate, as many hotels offer discounts for medical appointment-related stays., If you are to discontinue the use of some medications, this is especially important. You also need to know when to stop eating and drinking the night before surgery.,, You won't be able to eat after midnight (with exceptions) on this night, so make sure you are well-fed, and well-hydrated., This means no food or drink after a set time, usually midnight.,, Even though you will be ""sleeping"" with the anaesthesia the next day, you don't get rest with anaesthesia, so you still need to get a good sleep., This is for your safety, as you don't want to choke on your stomach contents while under general anaesthesia.

Remember, if you eat or drink, your surgery may be cancelled.

, It helps to wear short baggy shorts, as if you need a drain after surgery, this will make it easy to get your bottoms over the drain, and also the bulky dressing that will be on your knee after surgery. You may also have a knee immobilizer, which is also quite bulky., If you don't, you will have to wait even longer to get your knee fixed., Bring entertainment such as a phone or tablet, so you have something to do while you wait., After surgery, you will fell very tired, hungry and thirsty, and maybe a bit nauseous. You will also likely be in quite a bit of pain, and you may have a drain in your knee to drain excess blood and fluid from your knee. This will be removed about 18-36 hours after your surgery., Your surgeon should tell you or your parents all of this information."

Surf on the Internet if you have a computer.,
Watch your favorite television show, but make sure to keep the volume at an appropriate level so that you don't disturb the rest of your family.",How to Play While On Crutches," However, if you already have a swing set at home, you can swing on it without going too far from your house. Swing with your good leg while leaving your hurt leg sticking straight out so that it doesn't hit the ground hard. If you find that you have trouble, ask a family member or a friend to push you if he/she doesn't mind.;
, Take turns choosing fun games to play and spend quality time with your loved ones. Not only will you be able to participate in an activity that doesn't require the usage of your legs, but you'll also be able to connect and laugh with other people.

, Your writing can contain a serious tone that speaks of a death or it can bat fun at ridiculous situations. It's your story so have fun with it. If you find that you actually like it a lot, consider stretching it into a good novel and possibly getting it published.


If you have trouble coming up with good story lines, ask your family members and/or friends for some ideas. You could also search on the Internet for something that inspires you.

, It's a good time to recharge your energy level, but remember that you might have trouble falling asleep on that night, depending on how your body works. For fresh air and a calm scene, sleep outside in a lawn chair or a comfortable seat, but it isn't recommended if you don't want the neighbors to see you drooling or talking in your sleep.

, Get your mind off things and have a great time with your conversations. If you'd rather see them in person, invite them over if they're available to come to your house, but make sure your parents and their parents are fine with it. Otherwise, you might get in trouble, unless if it's normal for your friends to show up at your house without any plans in mind.

, It's not that hard since it's your leg that is hurt, not your hands.

, Now would be a good time to start on that big book your parents bought you for Christmas or catch up on your favorite celebrity's latest events.

, If you know your pet is rough and very playful, it's recommended that you avoid playing with it until your leg is completely healed or you might worsen your condition.


Remember that as much as your pet may love you, that doesn't mean accidents won't happen. It might not intentionally hurt you, but that doesn't make a difference in the results.

, Watch YouTube videos, edit wikiHow articles, scroll through blogs, etc. Computers can help pass the time very rapidly, especially if you choose the right websites to go to.

, Also, share the television remote with your siblings and your parents when they ask to change the channel because no one likes it when people hog the remote.

Strengthen your body to set the stage for a speedy recovery.,
Perform gluteal sets to strengthen your glutes.,
Try leg raises to strengthen your quadriceps and hips.,
Do ankle rotations.,
Take iron, and avoid blood thinning supplements.,
Call your insurance company to make sure your treatment and post-operative care are in order.",How to Prepare for Hip Replacement Surgery1," Although hip pain can significantly lessen the amount of exercise you do on a regular basis, you should make sure your lower body's muscles are in good condition prior to undergoing surgery.


If you have been abstaining from exercise, your leg and gluteal muscles may have become much weaker.
Ask your doctor (or a physical therapist) for the right exercises to help strengthen your back, leg, and gluteal muscles.
This way, your body can support your recovering pelvic muscles after surgery.
Some people can do specific exercises that others will have a hard time doing. Go easy on yourself and listen to your body's cues.;
, Gluteal sets are very easy to perform, and you don't need any special equipment to do them.


Just lie flat on your back and squeeze your buttock muscles for a few seconds.
Your hips should raise a little while doing this.
Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times.

, Leg raises are very easy to do and can be done on any flat surface, such as the floor or a firm mattress.


From the same starting position as the gluteal sets, you can advance to leg raises.
First, raise your knees.
Then, straighten your legs as much as you can, until your toes are pointing at the ceiling.
Hold this pose for a few seconds, then slowly lower your legs.

, You may use your hands to support your legs, or you can simply raise your legs as if you're about to do leg raises.


Rotate your ankles five times to the right and five times to the left.
Repeat with the other leg.

, Ask your doctor for recommended supplements to take prior to surgery, and follow his or her advice about other supplements you should take or avoid.


Iron is often recommended, because it helps prevent excessive bleeding after or during surgery.
Your doctor may advise you to stop taking certain supplements and medications that may interfere with the surgical and recovery processes, such as: vitamin E, gingko biloba, glucosamine/chondroitin, fish oil, turmeric, dong quai, or any other natural herbs or supplements that have known blood thinning capabilities.

, Sometime during the months leading up to your surgery, make sure that you call your insurance provider to let them know about your upcoming procedure.


Ask the insurance company if they will cover your post-operation care, such as therapy.

Ask a family member or friend to provide assistance after your surgery.,
Under your doctor's supervision, stop taking any blood-thinning medications to prevent excessive blood loss.,
Inform your family, friends, and colleagues of your surgery.,
Eat well to ensure that your body can heal efficiently.",How to Prepare for Hip Replacement Surgery2," A few weeks before the surgery, get your home ready.


Make sure that all the items you need on a regular basis are at hip level.
This way, you don't have to twist your pelvic muscles or strain other sore parts of your body.
Rearrange your closet so that items such as socks or underwear are near hip level, so you won’t have any trouble reaching down for those items.
Make sure you have a sleeping space in the downstairs of your home available for at least a couple of weeks after surgery, because stairs will be hard to handle.
Make sure you have a comfortable bed that makes it easy for you to lie down and get up with minimal support.
Get a chair with appropriate support, such as sturdy arms, to support yourself when you are getting up and sitting down.

, After your surgery, you may require a walker to help you with your routine activities.


Make sure that you arrange your house to enable unfettered movement.
Ensure that all objects are placed out of the way to help you move around easily.

, If your bathroom doesn't have any handle bars, now is the time to install them so you won’t have problems steadying yourself in the bathroom.


Arrange aids to help you bathe, including a chair and low level shelves to store your soaps and shampoos.

, Run errands to stock your house with the things you will need after your surgery.


Stock up on easy-to-prepare meals like frozen or canned food items.
Make sure that you have all the necessary items you need, like water, milk, snacks, juice, and other food items.
Don’t forget to stock up on items such as toilet paper, shampoo, soap, and other products that you use on a regular basis.

, Ask for a friend or a family member help you with grocery shopping, bill payments, and other necessary chores.


If that isn't possible, you could look into paying for bills online.
If you have a friend or family member who is able, have them cook delicious but healthy meals for you when they can.

, Your doctor may advise you to stop taking NSAIDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs a few weeks before surgery.


The reason for that is because NSAIDs are blood thinners and may increase blood loss during surgery.
Some medications taken for rheumatoid arthritis, such as humira, enbrel, methotrexate, and plaquinil, could impair your immune system, so it is best to abstain from using these if possible.
Also, avoid anticoagulants such as heparin and plavix, because these thin your blood and can increase blood loss when you undergo surgery.

, Your personal and business life is going to be affected by your hip replacement surgery, because you will need to take some time off to recover.


Once you learn how long it will take you to return to work, you need to plan your work schedule in such a way that the impact on your work will be reduced.
Try asking your partners or colleagues to help with your work until you can return.

, Talk to your doctor about the diet you should follow to make your surgery and recovery go smoothly.


Eat a balanced diet that gives you the energy necessary to recover.
Your doctors may suggest that you increase your intake of protein to speed up bone and muscle recovery.
Here are some suggestions to help you plan your diet:
Increase your protein intake by eating foods such as milk, eggs, fish, peanut butter, nuts, and beans.
Eat foods high in calcium to strengthen your bones, such as milk, cheese, yogurt and canned salmon.

"
"
Have someone accompany you to the hospital.,
Maintain perspective to stay calm and feel confident.",How to Prepare for Hip Replacement Surgery3," If someone can accompany you on the day of your surgery, they can help you in a few ways.


First, he or she can help fill out forms for you and remember the surgeon’s instructions before and after surgery.
This person can also help make your stay in the hospital be as comfortable as possible by assisting you when there is no nurse nearby, ensuring that you have all your necessary items at the ready, and helping you with the commute when it's time to go home.

, Don't focus on potential problems now that you are about to have your surgery.


Although you are having surgery and your life may be restricted for a few weeks, at the end of the day your quality of life will be improved.
Remembering this will shift your focus to your bright future.

Talk to your doctor about your risk factors and symptoms.,
Ask for a blood test.,
Work with your doctor to come up with a treatment plan.",How to Overcome a Vitamin D Deficiency1," Women who are pregnant or nursing, infants, the elderly, those who don't get much sun exposure, and people with darker skin are at a higher risk of developing a vitamin D deficiency. In addition, disorders such as Crohn’s disease and celiac disease can disrupt vitamin D absorption.If you fall into any of these categories, or are about to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment, discuss your vitamin D levels with your doctor.

Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include weakness, depression, fragile bones, and chronic bone or joint pain. These symptoms can be related to other medical issues, so you should see your doctor for an accurate diagnosis.;
, A blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a key step in treating vitamin D deficiency. Once your doctor determines your vitamin D levels, they can recommend the proper course of treatment.The test isn’t a part of routine care for the general population, but can be requested when a patient is in a higher risk category., If your blood test shows a mild deficiency, your doctor will likely recommend making dietary changes, taking a vitamin D supplement, and spending more time in the sun. If they detect a more serious deficiency, a high-dose therapy might be the best option.Rickets or a severe calcium deficiency can result from serious cases of vitamin D deficiency. If these are also detected, calcium supplementation via an IV might be necessary. This usually occurs only in infants suffering from seizures due to calcium malabsorption."
"
Take a vitamin D supplement.,
Spend more time in the sun.,
Eat foods that contain or are fortified with vitamin D. Fatty fish, such as salmon, and mushrooms are among the only foods that are naturally rich in vitamin D. Fortified cereals, milk, and orange juice are readily available, but it’s important to check nutrition labels.,
Expose mushrooms to ultraviolet light to increase vitamin D content.,
Get more exercise.",How to Overcome a Vitamin D Deficiency2," Based on the results of your blood test or physical examination, your doctor will recommend you take a vitamin D supplement.The dosage will vary based on the severity of your deficiency. A dosage of 1000 International Units (IU) is a common supplement dosage.Vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are widely available, and are both effective in treating a deficiency.

, Direct sunlight helps the body synthesize vitamin D. Some researchers have suggested spending up to 30 minutes twice a week in direct sun without sunscreen.However, this can increase the risk of skin damage and skin cancer, so it’s best to wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 8 or higher.In order to synthesize vitamin D, broad patches of skin will need sun exposure, so you should wear short sleeves and shorts. Just limit your direct exposure to less than 30 minutes.
Talk to your doctor about your risks for skin damage. Tell them about any family history of skin cancer and ask if extra sun exposure is right for you.

, Vitamin D fortification is not mandatory, so you should make sure a product is fortified before purchasing it.If you’re vegan or lactose intolerant, you can purchase soy milk fortified with vitamin D., Mushrooms contain vitamin D naturally but, like human skin, they synthesize more when exposed to sunlight. Leaving mushrooms gills side up in direct sunlight for as little as five minutes can increase their vitamin D content.You can also keep mushrooms under an indoor ultraviolet lamp.

, Exercising too little has been linked to vitamin D deficiency. Getting at least a half hour of exercise per day may help your body synthesize more vitamin D. Going for a brisk walk outside in direct sunlight can have increased benefits.Check with your doctor before taking on a new exercise regimen, especially if you have any bone, joint, or cardiovascular issues.

"
"
Get high-dose vitamin D therapy.,
Ask the doctor about calcium supplementation.,
Get another blood test within three months.",How to Overcome a Vitamin D Deficiency3," More serious cases of vitamin D deficiency might require high-dose therapy. Also known as stoss therapy, this method of treatment involves a total vitamin D dosage of 300,000 to 500,000 IU.Discuss factors like age with your doctor when considering stoss therapy. High-dose therapy has been linked with an increased fracture risk in older women., Severe cases of hypocalcemia, or calcium deficiency, can accompany vitamin D deficiency. Typically seen in infants under six months, hypocalcemia can cause seizures and lead to rickets, or soft, bent bones. An IV calcium supplement may be required and a patient should remain under close observation under calcium levels normalize., Your doctor will most likely recommend follow-up testing to gauge the treatment’s effectiveness. Annual tests might be required if you fall into a high risk category or have a condition that interferes with vitamin D absorption.Follow-up tests can also determine if your vitamin D levels are too high due to high-dose therapy. While vitamin D toxicity is rare, it can cause organ damage. Consult your doctor about stopping supplements until your vitamin D levels return to normal.

, If you don't get good data, you can't get a 3D volume. This will probably be an Axial 3D SPGR 1mm no spacing if you instructed the radtech to do it. It is best to get a 3D scan in all three planes, Axial, Sagital and Coronal.


The Radiologist doesn't know how to operated the MRI machine or software so you need to instruct the RadTech what you want. Radiologist like to ""reformat"" a scan.

This doesn't give good 3D data for sequencing. You can also ask to scan only the region of the tumor. This is a new function on GE scanners and most Rad Techs know what to do, but the radiologists are lost because this wasn't a function they had in the film days of past. They are used to looking at the entire head, instead of just the region where the tumor is.



, This should be the easy part, but the Radtech can't bill for this and the front office girls aren't computer literate, so it ends up being difficult. They are required to do it now, so insist. Radiologists are very protective of their data. The good thing, is it isn't their data, it is yours.

, Having it on the cloud will allow you to access it from any device.

, They don't have a MAC version yet. Most Radiologists are giving a free version of a viewer on the CD with your data. These don't allow you to ""export"" the dicom images in a format that can be read by the 3D sequencing program.

,, Start with the Axial 3D SPGR 1mm 512x512 series. Scroll your mouse up and down to see each image in the series. You could have hundreds of slices. Right Click on image and select ""Export"". Export all dicom images to a new folder named ""Date of Scan - Modality - resolution"" or ""2013.06.04 AX SPGR 1mm"" This is important because you will probably be measuring the tumor over time.

,, The latest version 2.4 is giving me distortions on Sagital and Coronal views. This is being built by the University of Pennsylvania and works great.

He or she will help coordinate your care with other disciplines, such as physical therapy or chiropractic, prescribe medications if they are needed, and stay on top of your condition to be certain a medical procedure is not necessary.;
, Your doctor will likely recommend physical therapy sessions to help relieve the pressure on the bulging disc, help the nerves in the area to recover, and reduce your pain.Physical therapy can make a big difference in relieving your symptoms, improving strength in your core muscles, increasing flexibility, and avoiding further injury and pain. The therapist will teach you important exercises that you can continue at home., In some cases, the pain experienced with a bulging disc can be severe. Your doctor can provide prescriptions for pain medications, for short-term use, that can help to provide some relief.Examples of medications that may be prescribed include opiate pain relievers such as hydrocodone or oxycodone, pain patches such as lidocaine or fentanyl, prescription strength anti-inflammatory agents, such as high dose ibuprofen, and muscle relaxers such as cyclobenzaprine or Metaxalone.

, If the symptoms are slow to respond and the pain is severe, you may want to consider injections to the site. The most common type of injection for treating bulging discs is a spinal injection, also known as a nerve block injection or epidural. This type of injection uses steroid-like medication injected directly into the area to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain., In some cases, surgical procedures may be the only option to treat the condition and provide pain relief. Minimally invasive procedures are successful at addressing the problems associated with bulging discs while reducing the risks involved with open back surgery.Commonly done procedures are called laminectomy, laminotomy, and microdiscectomy. Each procedure involves slightly differently methods to correct disc problems, depending on the location and extent of the damage., In some cases, surgical procedures can effectively remove the damaged disc by performing a procedure called a discectomy, then inserting a synthetic disc in its place. This type of surgery restores the height of the space between the vertebrae, and allows for normal movements., Talk to your doctor before adding any new medications to your existing regimen. Commonly recommended over-the-counter drugs include anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. Acetaminophen is helpful in providing added relief for the pain. Take the medications exactly as prescribed and talk to your doctor if you experience any side effects.Do not continue to take over-the-counter medications with prescription strength medications, unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Combining over-the-counter drugs with prescribed pain medications, anti-inflammatory agents, and muscle relaxers can be dangerous.

, Allow your body the time it needs to heal by getting enough rest while you pursue proper care. Appropriate care will likely include resting in short segments, like 30 minutes at a time, then walking or doing some light movements as recommended by your doctor and physical therapist.Avoid activities that can aggravate your condition, especially bending over and lifting and any twisting type of movement. Move slowly, and stop any activity if you feel pain. Pursue physical therapy that will include specific types of exercise to improve your condition., Initially the painful area will likely be swollen and inflamed. Applying ice, instead of heat, can help to reduce swelling and inflammation, and relieve the pain.Apply ice to the area for five minutes every hour. By the third or fourth hour, you should notice some relief. Continue to use the ice on the area of the bulging disc first, then you may also apply ice to any other affected areas, like painful nerves down your leg. Follow your doctor or therapist’s advice on how long, and how often, to continue the ice applications., Using applications of heat can be soothing to tight and sore muscles, and improve blood flow to the area. Improved blood flow means more oxygen to the muscles, and nutrients to the damaged disc. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to determine the proper rotation of hot and cold that is best suited to your condition., Being overweight naturally puts more stress on each disc. While it may be difficult to lose weight, especially at a time when you are in pain, pursuing weight control measures can make a difference in managing your existing pain, and preventing further problems, Your spine needs enough calcium and vitamin D every day to stay strong and avoid developing osteoporosis. Most adults do not get enough from their diet. Ask your doctor about the amount of calcium and vitamin D you should consume each day, in addition to your regular diet.Natural sources for calcium and vitamin D include dairy products, green, leafy vegetables, and fortified orange juice. Your body also absorbs vitamin D from being exposed to natural sunlight., Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as this puts added pressure on the discs in your back. Try sleeping on a firm mattress, and on your side, with pillows arranged for added support if helpful., Avoid lifting anything heavy if at all possible. If you must lift something, bend your knees and squat, then use your legs to lift the weight.It’s also important to avoid any lifting or repetitive twisting motions first thing in the morning.

, Proper standing and sitting positions include a straight, upright, position with your shoulders back. Engage abdominal muscles to provide support for your back, and maintain your lower back in a flat or slightly arched positionTo improve your balance, stand in a doorway, raise one leg high, bend your raised knee so your thigh is parallel to the floor. Hold that position for 20 seconds, then repeat with the other leg. Hold onto the wall or doorway if you need, but eventually you will be able to maintain the position without additional support.Improve your overall alignment by standing one foot length away from a wall, then lean back until your buttocks and your back are against the wall. Keeping your head level, push it back until the back of your head touches the wall. Most people find they must tilt their chin up to get their head to touch the wall, which indicates poor posture. Push your head back as far as you can while keeping it level. Hold this position for 20 seconds. Eventually, your head should reach the wall, without the unwanted tilt., Regular seating causes a pelvic tilt that puts extra pressure on your discs. Sitting in this position for extended periods can contribute to back problems, like bulging discs. Many experts are now recommending seating options called “active chairs”. An active chair is designed to help you maintain spinal integrity, engage your muscles, and work on your posture, all while you are seated.Several types of active chairs are available. A few examples include a Zenergy Ball Chair, Swopper Stool, Wobble Stool, Rockin’ Roller Desk Chair, and Humanscale Freedom Saddle Seat.Although these chairs may be beneficial, keep in mind that it is also important to get up and move around now and then. Try setting a timer to remind yourself to get up for a couple of minutes for every hour that you sit.

, Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to be sure this is safe for your condition. A therapy ball is similar to the large balls you may see in a gym or a physical therapy clinic.By softly bouncing for about five minutes each day, you improve the blood flow to the discs, bringing added nutrients and oxygen to the area. This provides for reduced inflammation, pain relief, and may help to prevent further problems., Specific types of exercise that target problems with back pain include flexion, extension, stretching, and aerobic exercise. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about developing an exercise routine that is safe, and helpful, for your condition.Keep in mind that everyone is different. Some people may respond best to back flexion exercises, while other people may respond best to back extension exercises. If you find that your back pain increases during any of these exercises, stop doing them immediately and see your doctor or physical therapist.

, Examples of low-impact exercise includes walking, swimming, cycling on a recumbent bike, meditation, or modified yoga. Depending on the position of the bulging disc along your spine, your age, weight, mobility, and other medical conditions you may have, your doctor and physical therapist are the experts on designing an exercise program that is suited for you., Manual or electric traction can be an excellent way to keep your discs healthy. Traction can help to reduce pressure on a disc, which is beneficial because that allows more nutrients to enter the disc.You can receive traction therapy at your chiropractor's office or physical therapy office, or use a home inverted traction unit. An economical choice for home therapy is a simple back stretcher with three levels of adjustment.

, Chronic pain can lead to anxiety, added stress, and depression, all of which interfere with your body's ability to heal. Take measures to provide support as you go through this difficult time. Find out about chronic pain support groups in your area. Keep in mind that this may be helpful to you, but you may also provide much needed support for others.

, Try activities such as massage, acupuncture, baths, walking, and meditation, to help you handle the physical and mental manifestations of dealing with both acute and chronic pain. Mindful meditation may produce improvements in chronic back pain that are similar to conventional treatments., Many people experience severe pain with a bulging disc. If your pain prevents you from performing routine daily activities, consult your doctor as soon as possible for treatment options, If your pain is severe, continues at that level for more than 7 days, gets even worse, or improves a little but persists for more than 3 weeks, then medical attention is warranted., Your condition may be progressing. This is evidenced by a change in your symptoms that may include new areas of pain or numbness, which indicate involvement of additional nerve roots located along the spine and near the damaged disc., Notify your doctor as soon as possible if you start having symptoms in your extremities, especially your legs. If you notice sudden or ongoing feelings of weakness, a feeling of numbness, tingling, or shooting pains in your legs when you cough, sneeze, or strain, contact your doctor as soon as possible., In some cases, the nerves involved with the bulging disc can cause changes in your bowel and bladder function. Contact your doctor immediately if this occurs.Back pain that occurs when you urinate, severe pain and muscle spasms deep in your back, or loss of control of your bladder or bowel function warrants immediate medical attention."

Keep your doctor informed of anything that makes your asthma better and worse, especially at work.Make sure to talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have with managing your asthma at work.;
, There are more than 250 substances that may make your asthma symptoms worse at work. Recognizing what they are can help you avoid them. It may also help your employer take positive steps to accommodate your needs in the workplace.Common triggers for asthma in the workplace include:

Chemicals used in manufacturing
Paint
Cleaning products
Dusts from products such as wood, grain, or flour
Latex products
Mold and mildew
Animals and/or insects
Cigarette smoke

, Each individual case of asthma is different. Some people may have several triggers while others only have one. Identifying your specific triggers both at and outside work can help you more effectively avoid them and manage your asthma while you’re on the job.Keep a diary or log of symptoms you experience at work. Watch for patterns such as times of day, specific locations, or stressful situations that happen and result in worse symptoms or asthma attacks.
Notice if being away from work helps relieve your symptoms.

, Your diary or log may point you to specific triggers for asthma at work. You may also be aware of developments or deliveries of products in your office that can cause asthma attacks. Avoiding triggers or specific settings at work may help you more effectively manage your asthma at work.Ask your employer or colleagues of any upcoming construction, deliveries, or new products that may make your symptoms worse. You may be able to work from home these days or get a workspace far away from the trigger. For example, you may be able to go outside through a side door instead of having to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke near the front entrance.

, Prevention is the best way to manage symptoms. Letting your colleagues know about your asthma and what makes it worse at work can get them to help you manage your symptoms. They may inform you of areas of the office to avoid or anything else that may trigger your asthma.Inform your colleagues kindly verbally or by email. For example, you could say, “Janice, I really enjoy our chats and want to continue them. What would you say if we stepped outside while we talk? I know you love that jazzy perfume and I am unfortunately allergic to scents. This way, we can continue our chats, get some fresh air, and both stay healthy.”
Write your colleagues polite emails. For example, “Dear Colleagues, I wanted to let you know that I have been having a really difficult time with my asthma. If I stay out of your offices, I’m not trying to be rude, but simply avoid an attack. I’m very allergic to scents, mold, and mildew. If you know of anything that may make my asthma worse, could you please let me know? I’m happy to talk to you about it any time.”

, In addition to your colleagues, make sure your employer knows about your asthma. Your employer is required to provide you a safe working environment. This includes informing you of general and specific hazards of your job. Letting your employer know about your asthma can not only help you manage it at work, but may also help them address specific problems triggering your symptoms.Give your employer as much detailed information as you can or with which you are comfortable. If you like, offer to have your doctor write a note or call your employer with specific information.

, You may need specific accommodations at your job to avoid triggers and attacks. If this is the case, ask your employer to accommodate you as much as possible. Some things that may help you manage your asthma at work include:Having occasional work at home days
Eliminating sources of unhealthy air
Using safer cleaning products
Using safer chemicals and machinery
Using respiratory or protective gear to avoid exposure to triggers
Implementing smoking restrictions, If you experience any asthma symptoms at work, report them immediately to your supervisor. This can not only help you manage your symptoms, but also ensure your employer or building management takes care of the problem promptly.Call or email your supervisor as soon as you notice symptoms and remove yourself from the situation. You can say, “Hi Bill, my asthma started to get worse a few minutes ago. I’m going to step out for a few minutes to see if that helps. Would you be able to have someone check my air filters? Do you know of anything that’s come in today that may make my asthma worse?”

, If you notice stale or heavy air in your office, let your boss or the building management know. Telling either that the ventilation may be broken can help them address them problem quickly and may prevent you from worsening symptoms or an attack.Collaborate with management to investigate ventilation problems. Recognize that it may take time to identify the exact problem because of underlying issues.

, In some cases, you may feel like your employer or building management isn’t taking your health or concerns seriously. If this happens, you can request a Health Hazard Evaluation, which will identify possible health hazards in your workplace. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Help can provide assistance and information by phone or in writing. In some cases, they may even visit your workplace to assess employee health.Find information on requesting a Health Hazard Evaluation at https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/request.html. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health can also provide you information on getting evaluations and surveillance of your workplace by state officials., See your doctor regularly if you suffer from asthma, especially if it is triggered by your workplace. This can help your doctor manage symptoms, review your treatment, and monitor your progress. Let your doctor know if you’re having difficulty managing your symptoms or they get worse because of your work situation.Tell the doctor how you feel, what makes your asthma better or worse, and how you have managed your symptoms.

, Just as it’s important for your employer to look at for your health, you also need to take care of your asthma.A healthy diet can help prevent symptoms of asthma. Keep up with it during the work day with healthy meals and snacks.

Eat healthy foods from the five food groups. Have extra fruits and vegetables, which may help control lung swelling and irritation.Avoid foods that trigger asthma attacks or symptoms such as wine, dried fruits, pickles, and shrimp.

, You probably control environmental factors, such as dust, in your home. Doing this in your office or workspace can also manage your asthma and prevent attacks while you’re on the job.Run an air conditioner if possible, which can reduce pollen in the air. Consider keeping a small air purifier or office-sized air filtration system near you to reduce the risk of an attack or worsening symptoms.Using a humidifier or dehumidifier can keep your office at optimal humidity, which may help you better manage your asthma.Keep a small vacuum cleaner or duster in your office. This can reduce dust and dust mites in your workspace.
Ask to have your office cleaned at least weekly to minimize dust, pollen, dander and other triggers., If your office is a particularly stressful environment, take time to do deep breathing exercises every day. This can help manage your asthma.Deep breathing can calm and relax you, which may decrease psychological stress that exacerbates asthma.

Inhale and exhale through your nose. Breathe in to a count of 4, hold it for a count of 2, and then breathe out for a count of 4. Adjust the count numbers as you like.Sit upright with relaxed shoulders to optimize your breathing exercises.

, It is important to take any medicines prescribed by your doctor exactly as you were instructed to. Also, make sure to keep your asthma medicine with you at all times. Most asthma management treatments include medication. Prescription medications such as anti-inflammatories or bronchodilators can help you manage your asthma and prevent attacks. Your doctor may prescribe one or two types of oral and inhaled asthma medication to help you manage your symptoms at work. Some individuals take both medications at the same time. You may need:Anti-inflammatories to reduce swelling and decrease on mucus in your airways. Anti-inflammatories ease breathing.
Bronchodilators that relax the muscles around your airways. These increase your breathing rate and the amount of oxygen in your lungs., If you don’t take prescription medication for your asthma, you can manage some symptoms with allergy medications. These are especially helpful if your asthma is a result of allergies. Ask your doctor if taking allergy meds while you’re at work can help you manage your asthma.Use oral and nasal antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and fluticasone. They may ease or relieve your asthma symptoms. Your doctor can suggest an appropriate an over-the-counter antihistamine for you.
Keep a supply of anti-histamines at your desk in case of worsening symptoms or an attack.

Take prescription medications to prevent osteoporosis.",How to Maintain Strong Bones when You Have Crohn's Disease1," Because your intestine doesn’t absorb nutrients the way it should, you might not get all the calcium you need from your food. If you have low calcium, talk to your doctor about whether you should take a calcium supplement. Calcium promotes strong bones and is important for keeping your bones healthy.The average recommended daily dose is 1,000 milligrams (mg) for adults up to age 50, and 1,200mg for adults age 51 and over.Because people with Crohn’s may not absorb nutrients well, ask your doctor what is an appropriate dose for you to take.;
, Your body needs vitamin D to promote bone growth and so that your body can absorb calcium.If you’re too low in vitamin D, you may need to take a supplement. Ask your doctor if this is appropriate for you.

, Not everyone with Crohn’s needs to take medicine to prevent weak bones – you may be able to manage the risk with diet and supplements. However, you may qualify for medical therapy if a bone density scan shows your bones are dangerously weak. Ask your doctor about options. They will discuss with you the best possible therapy and weigh the risks and benefits. Some medications that treat osteoporosis include:Bisphosphonates
Estrogen
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
Denosumab

Using allergen-free bedding to help minimize your exposure to allergens while you are sleeping.
Watching for mold in damp places, such as in your bathroom and kitchen. Get rid of any mold you find right away, such as by spraying it with bleach or by calling a specialist to take care of it for you.
Not allowing anyone to smoke inside of your home.;
, Conditions such as obesity and heart disease can cause asthma or make it worse. Regular exercise can help control your weight, manage asthma and relieve its symptoms.Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise regimen. Your doctor will let you know if you are healthy enough for exercise and what types may suit you best.
Get regular exercise or physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of physical activity five or six days a week.Do activities you like including walking, running, biking, or swimming. Consider other activities such as yoga or Pilates, which can also calm you and strengthen your heart and lungs.Be aware that some activities, such as swimming, biking, and hiking may make you less prone to asthma attacks.Avoid exercise when levels of pollution and allergens such as pollen, grass weed or mold are high. Check the pollen count before exercising outdoors. In general, exercising outside in the morning is not recommended because pollen is at its highest level. The best time of the day to exercise to reduce exposure to pollen is in the evening or after it rains., Just as exercise can promote your overall health and help manage asthma, so can a healthy diet. Eat a healthy and balanced diet of three meals and two snacks per day to help control your weight and manage your asthma symptoms.


Incorporate a variety of foods from the five food groups. Consider getting extra fruits and vegetables, which may ease lung swelling and irritation.Stay away from foods that can trigger asthma symptoms. Foods containing sulfites including wine, dried fruits, pickles, and fresh and frozen shrimp may make your symptoms worse.

, Many people find their asthma symptoms are worse after being exposed to environmental factors such as dust or pollen. Limiting your exposure to these triggers can help you manage your asthma and prevent attacks in the future.Cool your home with an air conditioner. This can reduce the amount of pollen circulating in the air.
Reduce the dust—and dust mites—in your home through daily vacuuming or removing carpeting.
Cover the bed furniture with a dust proof cover. You can find dust covers for your mattress, pillows, and box springs at many retailers.
Remove dust, pet dander, mold spores and pollen in your home by cleaning it regularly.Cockroaches can also trigger asthma attacks. Regular cleaning may help, but if you have a severe infestation, you may need to use a professional exterminator.Limit the time you spend outside to avoid prolonged exposure to pollen or air pollution., Gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, and heartburn can harm airways and exacerbate asthma. See your doctor about getting treatment for GERD and heartburn. This may reduce your intestinal discomfort and help you manage asthma symptoms.Ask your doctor if over-the-counter medications such as Zantac-75 and Pepcid-AC can help control your GERD and heartburn.

, Taking time every day to do deep breathing exercises can help control asthma symptoms. Deep breathing works best in conjunction with medication. It may also ease symptoms as well as decrease the dose of medication you take.Deep breathing will also calm and relax you, which may help reduce any psychological stress that makes asthma worse.


Recognize that deep breathing helps oxygen flow through your body. This can decrease your heart rate, slow your pulse, and relax you. All of these benefits also help manage asthma.Breathe in and out completely through your nose. Inhale to a count of 4, hold it for a count of 2, and then exhale to a count of 4. Adjust the count number as you like.Optimize your deep breathing exercises by sitting upright with your shoulders pulled down. Pull in your belly to expand your lungs and rib cage as you inhale., These drugs are prescribed for heart disease, migraines, and glaucoma. However, they can sometimes cause asthma symptoms even in people who do not have asthma. Therefore, it is best to avoid these drugs if you have asthma.Always check with your doctor before stopping a medication.

, Patients with severe persistent asthma, nasal polyps, or a history of sensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are especially at risk of severe and possibly fatal exacerbation when using these drugs.Talk to your doctor if you are not sure what drugs you may be allergic to.

, Some people manage their asthma with herbal and natural remedies. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying herbal and natural remedies. Your doctor can make sure you’re healthy enough to use these remedies. The doctor may also suggest remedies that could help you manage your asthma.Read product labels for herbal or natural remedies containing black seed, caffeine, choline, and pycnogenol. These may ease your symptoms.
Combine three parts tincture of lobelia and one part tincture of capsicum. Add twenty drops of the mixture to water. This may ease a severe asthma attack.Incorporate ginger and turmeric into your diet. These spices may reduce inflammation.

Learn about the consequences of the degradation of erythrocytes in the process of cellular hemolysis.",How to Learn and Understand the Types and Etiologies of Anemias in Humans," This article discusses the medical syndrome of blood anemia in humans. Anemia is by definition low content of red blood cells in the arteries and veins of the body. Red blood cells are the main cellular components of this essential fluid in the body. Red blood cells are one type of many cells in the body that are important due to their role in the transport of oxygen molecules to the various body tissues. This is a very basic and fundamental process in the body that is essential for the maintaining of consciousness and life in individual humans. Red blood cells of humans are usually obtained in cellular differentiation processes that involve precursor cells that are called reticulocytes. Red blood cells of erythrocytes do not have the biochemical machinery to divide and replicate. This is so because they do not contain nuclei.;
, Reticulocytes which are the precursor cells of erythrocytes do contain nuclei. These reticulocytes differentiate into erythrocytes by the process of nuclei expulsion from the reticulocyte cells. When the nucleus of the reticulocyte cell is removed the cell is then called a mature erythrocyte or a mature red blood cell. Red blood cells in the body of humans serve several functions but their main function is the transport of oxygen form the lungs to the various body tissues through the blood stream. This important physiological process is mediated by several metabolic processes that can be involved in the etiology of anemia in affected persons. For example the transition metal ion of iron is one metal that is used in the process of binding oxygen in the heme molecule of the hemoglobin protein.

, This iron metal ion has very basic but also very important function in this process of oxygen transport in the blood. The oxidation state of this metal ion is very crucial here for the proper binding of the oxygen molecule in the heme molecule. For this reason there is in the body a special form of enzyme that is used exclusively to modify the oxidation state of this metal between +2 and +3 oxidation states. Due to its importance in this process of oxygen binding it is not surprising that iron metal ion deficiency in the body is one form of anemia in humans. This metal ion level in the blood can be corrected by the administration of supplementary amounts of iron salts that are easily absorbed into the blood and are easily transformed into its free ionic metal forms. Commercially available forms of iron metals ions for medicinal purposes include the sulfate salts of iron metal.

, Other forms of blood anemia include folic acid deficiency in the blood. This form of anemia is due to metabolic defects in the pathways for the synthesis of the DNA and RNA molecules of the red blood cells. Folic acid is one form of essential vitamin that is not synthesized in the body of humans. It must be administered exogenous in the form of tablets that range in its quantities. This acid in involved metabolically in the synthesis of DNA and RNA bases in the red blood cells.

, The lack of this vitamin in the body makes these metabolic processes absent or dysfunctional. The net result is low yield of red blood cells production in the body. This type of metabolic anemia can be corrected by the administration of supplementary amounts of this vitamin into the body. Excessive amount of this acid in the body can sometimes cause metabolic acidosis in the body.

, Red blood cells are usually produced in the red bone marrow under the stimulatory effect of the hormone erythropoietin. This is an important hormone for the normal production of red blood cells in the body. It is usually synthesized in specialized cells in the kidneys. Anemia due to absence of this hormone can be triggered in cases of chronic kidney failure. This type of kidney disease has several clinical manifestations. One of them is related to the development of anemia. This is the inability of the kidney cells to properly synthesize this protein hormone into the blood circulation. This type of anemia is common in people who have dysfunctional kidneys.

, Treatment of this type of anemia can be performed through the administration of analogues of this hormone into the body. Other forms of anemias in the human body include blood disorders due to genetic defects in the hemoglobin molecules. One form of such a genetic disorder is called thalassemia. This is one form of anemias that occurs due defective function of one of the polypeptide chains that are attached to the porphoryne molecule of the hemoglobin protein. This genetic defect makes these red blood cells dysfunctional and disabled in its normal function of oxygen transport in the blood. The other common genetic disorder that can also cause blood anemia is called sickle cells anemia. This genetic disorder of red blood cells is characterized by the abnormal cellular structure of the red blood cells that is sickled in its morphological form.

, This form can impair the function of these cells to transport oxygen in the blood. These two forms of genetic anemias can predispose to jaundice or bilirubin accumulation in the body. Red blood cells in these two disorders are easily destroyed. This in turn allows the digestive enzymes of these cells to digest their cellular contents such as the heme portion and the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules.

, The net result is the build up of large number of amino acids in the blood and the accumulation of the yellow pigment bilirubin in the skin epithelium and in the white sclera of the eyes. Anemias can also develop due to other reasons. Notable here is the anemia due to malignant tumors. Cancer is usually accompanied with the development of anemic blood. This can be logically explained by the fact that cancer cells consume most of the body energetic resources in the form of amino acids and glucose molecules.

Usually, doctors give an initial dose of 20 to 30 mg of prednisone to those who have autoimmune hepatitis.The maintenance therapy dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg for at least 18 to 24 months of monitored drug intake. Keep in mind that people may experience remission or temporary recovery from the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis, but after the drug has been stopped, symptoms usually do appear again.

, Prednisone can either be a tablet or given as a solution (liquid form). The drug is usually taken with food 1 to 4 times a day, though your doctor may give you specific instructions.Always talk to your doctor before you decide to stop taking a medication like prednisone. Abrupt withdrawal from the drug can lead to extreme fatigue, bodily weakness, upset stomach, weight loss, and mouth sores due to the inability of your body to produce its natural steroids.

, Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms. Prednisone has a wide range of side effects which include:


Headaches, dizziness, acne, having diabetes, cataract (clouding of the lens of the eyes), glaucoma (elevated pressure on the eyes), high blood pressure, and the possibility for osteoporosis (weakening of the bones).

, Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant medication that lessens the activity of the immune system. It is often prescribed in combination with prednisone to lessen the side effects caused by prednisone, while also managing your condition.


Side effects of taking azathioprine include: nausea, vomiting, skin rash, low white blood cell count, and liver damage.
When taking this drug, you will most likely have your white blood cell levels routinely checked, as this medication can affect your white blood cell levels.

, An initial treatment for this type of therapy includes 10 to 20 mg of prednisone and 50 to 100 mg of azathioprine.Your doctor may prescribe different dosages depending upon your specific condition.

, A liver transplant is a procedure that removes the damaged liver cells by replacing your liver with a healthier donated liver. Talk to your doctor about your options when it comes to getting on the list for a liver transplant., Evaluation is needed to determine if you can undergo such a procedure. Certain diagnostic tests include:


A laboratory test to determine the health status of your organs, and primarily your liver; imaging tests such as an ultrasound of the liver; and a heart evaluation to determine your cardiovascular status.

, During the surgery, the surgeon will use general anesthesia. An incision will be made along your abdomen in order to access the liver.Blood supply and ducts are then detached from the damaged liver, and the new liver takes it place. The surgeon will then close the incision using stitches and staples and you’ll be delivered to the intensive care unit to evaluate your after-surgery status. The surgery may take 10 to 12 hours.
You may be asked to stay in the hospital for one to two weeks. You will be given immunosuppressant medications. Your recovery period may last anywhere from six months to one year.

Quit smoking to help improve your symptoms and maintain stronger bones.If you need help quitting, ask your doctor. They may be able to assist you with medications, patches, or gum.

, These exercises help to build stronger bones by increasing bone density.Use free weights, resistance bands, or your body weight to strengthen your major muscle groups. Walk, use the elliptical machine, garden, do low-impact aerobics, and climb stairs.How often and how much you should workout depends on your health.


Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. You need to create a safe workout if you already have weakened bones.
If you have weak bones, avoid twisting your spine and doing high-impact activities like running, jumping, or jogging.

, Crohn’s Disease is an inflammatory bowel disease and can lead to the malabsorption of nutrients. One way to tackle the problem may be to try to address your underlying immune over-activity. Some research indicates that you may be able to help this by changing your diet, including restricting certain carbs, eating more probiotic foods, changing your intake of fats, and other things.In an anti-inflammation diet, you’ll remove or reduce your intake of things like sugars and refined carbohydrates, glutens and grain, and some oils.
The diet instead focuses on lean meats, poultry and fish, omega3 eggs, and particular kinds of carbs. You’ll also eat select fruits and vegetables, nut and legume flours, probiotics like kefir, yogurt, miso, and other cultured products, and prebiotics in the form of soluble fiber (found in things like bananas, oats, and flax meal).
Some people on an anti-inflammation diet also modify texture, blending, softening, or pureeing foods, especially if they are sensitive to intact fiber.
Of course, you should always talk to your doctor or dietician before going on a special diet.

, If you can tolerate it, drink milk and eat dairy products. These are rich in calcium. Unfortunately, many people with Crohn’s disease are lactose intolerant or experience symptoms when they eat dairy.In that case, incorporate whatever calcium-rich foods you can into your regular diet, such as:Dark green leafy vegetables like kale and broccoli
Sardines and canned salmon
Products that are calcium-fortified including soy, cereal, fruit juice, and milk substitutes

, Regularly eat milk, cereal, and other products that are fortified with vitamin D.Egg yolks contain small amounts of vitamin D, so try to eat whole eggs. Snack on canned salmon or sardines – fish that have soft, edible bones., Ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietician. They can help you create meal plans that include the nutrients you need to maintain strong bones.Some dieticians are specially trained to work with people with Crohn’s and other diseases.

, Spend around 10-30 minutes in the sun without sunscreen twice a week. Let the skin of your arms, legs, chest, and back soak up the rays. Sunlight helps your body make vitamin D.You should not, however, get sunburned. If you have fair skin or burn easily, limit your time in the sun without sunscreen to 10 minutes or less. If you have darker skin, you can stay out for up to 30 minutes.
If you live in a cold climate, get what sunlight you can by sitting near a bright window.

Work closely with your doctor.,
Have diagnostic blood tests done.,
Test your bone density.",How to Maintain Strong Bones when You Have Crohn's Disease3," Crohn’s disease is a serious illness that can affect many parts of your body. It’s important to work closely with your doctor or even a specialist called a gastroenterologist. They can help you manage your symptoms, treat pain, and avoid complications of the disease including osteoporosis and bone fractures.Always take your medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider.


A common treatment for Crohn’s, corticosteroids, can also cause osteoporosis.

, Ask your doctor to check your levels of calcium and vitamin D. These are two very important minerals for bone health. This can be done with a simple blood test. These levels are often low in people who have Crohn’s disease.

, Consider getting a test done to test the density of your bones. This will show whether you have strong or weak bones from osteoporosis. It may help you and your doctor know how to manage your condition.This test is similar to an x-ray. It is painless and only takes about 15 minutes to complete."

Discuss bronchial thermoplasty with your doctor.",How to Manage Adult Asthma2," It’s important to see your doctor regularly if you suffer from asthma or asthma symptoms. This gives you and a doctor a chance to review your treatment and monitor progress. You should also visit your doctor if you’re having difficulty managing your symptoms or they get worse.Let your doctor know information such as how you feel, factors that make your asthma worse or better, and what you’ve been taking to manage your symptoms beyond medication.

, The foundation of most asthma management regimens is medication. Prescription medication can help you manage your asthma and prevent attacks.Depending on the severity of your asthma, your doctor may prescribe one or two types of oral and inhaled asthma medication. Many people take both types at the same time:


Anti-inflammatories to minimize swelling and cut down on mucus in your airways. Anti-inflammatories ease breathing.
Bronchodilators to relax the muscles around your airways. Bronchodilators increase your breathing rate. They also boost the amount of oxygen in your lungs., Anti-inflammatory medications are especially important for an individual with asthma. Taken orally or inhaled, these medications control inflammation, reduce swelling, and decrease mucus in your airways. Anti-inflammatories can help you manage or prevent asthma symptoms if taken daily.Your doctor may prescribe the following anti-inflammatories:Inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, or mometasone. You generally need to use inhaled corticosteroids longer-term to get their full effect. These medications have few side effects.
Leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast, zafirlukast, or zileuton. Leukotriene modifiers can relieve asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. Use these medications with care because they may cause psychological reactions such as agitation and aggression.
Cell stabilizers such as cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium., Your doctor may also prescribe a bronchodilator. These medications come in short or long-term formulations. Short-term bronchodilators, also known as rescue inhalers, ease symptoms and can stop asthma attacks.These include albuterol and levalbuterol. Ipratropium is another rescue inhaler that works quickly to relax your airway. Long-term bronchodilators can help you manage symptoms and prevent attacks.Your doctor may prescribe any of the follow bronchodilators to help manage your asthma:


Long-acting beta agonists such as salmeterol or formoterol.Beta agonists can expand your airways. They may increase your risk of a severe asthma attack, so considering taking beta agonists.
Combination inhalers such as fluticasone-salmeterol, or mometasone-formoterol
Anticholinergics such as theophylline., You may be able to manage asthma symptoms with allergy medications. This is especially true if your asthma is a result of allergies. Ask your doctor if taking allergy meds can help you manage your asthma.Try oral and nasal antihistamines such as montelukast and/or fluticasone nasal spray. They can decrease and/ or relieve your allergies and make asthma symptoms better. Your doctor can prescribe or recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine for you. Although, Benadryl is an antihistamine, it can cause a significant problem in asthmatics because it makes secretions sticky and this makes it harder to clear the airway. Consult your primary care provider about which medications you should avoid if you have asthma.
Consider regular allergy shots. They may minimize your body’s reaction to allergens that trigger your asthma in the long-term.

, Bronchial thermoplasty employs heat to limit the ability of airways to tighten. It is not a widely available treatment. Discuss if bronchial thermoplasty is option with your doctor if your asthma doesn’t improve with other treatments.Undergo that bronchial therapy in three outpatient hospital visits. This treatment heats your airways in order to decrease the smooth muscle in them. In turn, this contracts and limits your air intake.Bronchial thermoplasty can last for up to a year. You may need further treatments in the following years."

You may be at risk for asthma if you:Have a blood relative sibling with asthma
Have allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis
Are overweight
Smoke
Are exposed to secondhand smoke
Work with or are exposed to exhaust fumes or other pollutants

, Adult asthma presents with different symptoms. These can range from mild severe and be persistent or intermittent. Observing potential symptoms can help you get a prompt diagnosis and treatment.Adult asthma may come with the following symptoms:Shortness of breath.
Tightness or pain in the chest.
Insomnia that comes from shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing
Wheezing, which is a high-pitched whistling or wheezing sound when you inhale or exhale
Worsening symptoms when you have a cold or the flu

, Watch out for any symptoms of asthma if you are at risk. Continue to observe if they are present after a few days. This may indicate asthma. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to get a prompt diagnosis and treatment, which can help you manage symptoms.Listen to your breath when you exercise. If you have any asthma symptoms, it may be sports-induced asthma.
Observe if your symptoms are present only at work, which may mean you have occupational asthma. Chemical fumes, gases and dust can trigger asthma symptoms.Watch if your symptoms get worse at certain times of the year or around animals. This may indicate allergy-induced asthma triggered by certain pollens, pet dander, or cockroaches.

Treat chronic viral hepatitis.,
Deal with drug-induced hepatitis.,
Get conditions such as thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes under control.,
Pay attention to any chronic inflammatory diseases.,
Treat Wilson’s disease.",How to Manage Autoimmune Hepatitis2," Viral hepatitis can trigger the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis. The process by which these hepatitis viruses are able to induce autoimmune hepatitis is not yet fully understood.There is no specific medication yet for hepatitis B and C. The treatment targets the viruses which cause hepatitis B and C, so antiviral drugs such as lamivudine (Epivir-HBV®) are given for hepatitis B virus and sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) with ribavirin for hepatitis C virus.Seek medical advice regarding drug details and administration procedure.

, Some drugs are thought to be associated with the prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis. These drugs are: minocycline, hydralazine, methyldopa, statins, azathioprine, diclofenac, pemoline, and interferon.


Though it is not clear how these drugs initiate the autoimmune response, research shows that hepatocytes (cells of the liver) can form drug-protein antigens (a substance that stimulates the body to produce immune response) which in turn initiates the body’s immune system. Additionally, these drugs tend to interact with the body’s natural killers cells such as T-cells and B-cells, which in turn initiate a heightened immune response.
If your doctor suspects you to have drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis, he or she will slowly reduce your prescription for the medication. He or she will not immediately cut back the medication, as this could cause negative side effects.

, A definite association between other autoimmune disorders and autoimmune hepatitis is not clearly established and understood. Having said that, it is still important to manage these other conditions if you are dealing with autoimmune hepatitis.Talk to your doctor about methods for controlling these conditions that will work well with the management plan you have already created for autoimmune hepatitis.

, A possible connection between autoimmune hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the small joints of the hands and feet) is not very clear, but some research shows that there may be a connection.Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and the rectum) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and hardening of bile ducts) has a non-definitive link to having autoimmune hepatitis.

, Wilson’s disease may also have a connection to autoimmune hepatitis. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that causes defective copper excretion that greatly affects the liver.

Increase your vitamin D intake.,
Do some weight bearing exercises.,
Quit smoking gradually.,
Stay away from alcohol.",How to Manage Autoimmune Hepatitis3," Some studies show that calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) can help in liver damage recovery through its anti proliferative (inhibits cell growth) and antifibrotic (prevents tissue scarring) effects.Furthermore, research also shows that vitamin D can have an immunomodulatory effect which means that it can regulate the functions of the immune system.

, Weight bearing exercises can help to keep your body in a fit condition, which may make it more prepared to face conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.


Try to exercise regularly. This means roughly 30 minutes for five days a week. This could include walking, jogging, stair climbing, and lifting weights., Smoking cessation can help in the recovery of damaged liver cells. Work with your doctor to come up with a plan for you to slowly quit smoking, as quitting abruptly may cause some people to feel side effects like headache and nausea.Your doctor may prescribe nicotine-aids and may recommend smoke counseling or joining a group for people who are trying to quit.

, Alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited if you are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Alcohol damages your pancreas, liver, and other organs. Alcohol consumption produces oxidative stress which means that whenever the liver tries to break down the components of alcohol, it consequently damages the liver tissue that leads to scarring and inflammation."

Talk with your orthopedic doctor about what treatment is best for you and how you can manage pain. Be sure to go in regularly for check ups and X-rays. Here are some basic facts about osteochondromas to get you started:


Osteochondromas appear in roughly 3 percent of the general population, appear in most people around the ages of 12-18 and are non-cancerous
Osteochondromas can appear as single tumors or through out the body and the most affected areas are usually joints such as the knee area and elbows
Most people can live their lives with these and do not need therapy or to have them surgically removed, but not all cases are the same and if you are experiencing pain or are worried about how things are developing, talk to your doctor and make a plan together. Be sure to give details about where the pain is and what activities irritate it.;
, Try to talk with someone else who has one if you can! They can help you understand what's happening and have tips about how to deal with or manage pain.

, If you really feel that your pain is getting out of hand, limit yourself. Try to understand and accept that you won't be able to all the things you used to and maybe running 20 laps every morning isn't good for you anymore.

, Starting psychical therapy is a good way to rebuild stronger muscles that will allow you to do more with yourself than you could before. Most psychical therapy is only about twice a week for an hour at a time, so it allows you to do other things too.


Remember: therapy is not always a permanent solution, and you may need to continue with surgery plans. Try not to become depressed when you can't do the things you want. Get out there and meet new people and find new activities you love!

, Try an ice massage or an old fashioned ice pack and get icing! You can watch TV while you do it, but keep an eye on time. 10 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should ice each area a day. 

, Avoid flat shoes as these put a strain on your legs if you have an osteochondroma there.

, Understand that you're not invincible and sometimes you will need to take breaks.

, If someone asks you why you limp, or why you have to sit out some activities, just explain. Sometimes it can be embarrassing to talk about it, or maybe you don't want to strain the conversation or make it awkward, but it's best to not beat around the bush. Here's an example conversation and explanation:


Stranger: Why are you limping?
You: I have an Osteochondroma in my leg. It's a non cancerous tumor, not much too it.
Stranger: Oh my God! Doesn't it hurt?
You may want to roll your eyes or say ""You don't say?"" At this point, but continue the conversation. Remember not everyone knows as much about this as you do, and a short and simple explanation will do just fine. Some people only confess they have an Osteochondroma when they have a strong or long relationship with someone, and this is okay too. You are free to explain as little or as much as you'd like.

, Make sure to follow these tips and manage your pain when needed. That's about all! Now go out and enjoy life!"

Trace your baby’s family history of asthma and allergies.,
Watch for signs at birth or early in life.,
Identify environmental factors.,
Monitor your baby’s breathing patterns.,
Keep track of wheezing episodes.,
Identify possible triggers for wheezing.,
Seek immediate help for a possible asthma attack.,
Accept that diagnostic options for babies are limited.,
Ask your doctor about the API test for childhood asthma.,
Use prescribed asthma medications as a safety measure and diagnostic tool.",How to Know if Your Baby Has Asthma," As with many medical conditions, a family history of asthma (especially in a parent) is a strong indicator that a baby may develop the disease. However, any family history not only of asthma but also many types of allergies or skin conditions like eczema will increase the risk to your baby.Most forms of asthma, many types of allergies, and certain skin conditions like eczema share close commonalities as conditions caused by over-zealous body responses to potential dangers. Parents don’t pass on a specific allergy. They can, however, pass along an “allergic tendency” — so a parent with a pollen allergy has a greater risk of having a child with asthma.;
, Regardless of inherited traits, some babies are more prone to asthma as soon as they are born. For a variety of possible reasons including lung development, premature babies are more likely to develop asthma.Children who develop allergies or eczema at an early age are also more likely to have asthma.
Many cases of infant asthma form in combination with viral respiratory infections (colds), and may or may not go away thereafter.
If your baby is diagnosed with one of these conditions, talk to your doctor about the steps you should take to watch for asthma.

, Smoking is bad for your baby in countless ways, including the fact that it increases the risk of developing asthma. Smoking while pregnant increases this risk, as does keeping the baby in a home where smoking occurs.Frequent exposure to other forms of smoke (such as from a wood-burning fireplace) may also increase the risk of asthma. Exposure to common allergens like dust, dander, and pollen can also make asthma more likely. Especially if your baby is already at an elevated risk for developing asthma, you may want to reconsider keeping pets in the home.

, The lungs and airways of a baby are smaller than those of older kids or adults and still developing, so it should be no surprise that asthma can present differently in newborns and infants. For instance, babies rarely wheeze (because of asthma or otherwise) before reaching two months of age, and most episodes of wheezing in the months thereafter are usually caused by colds or factors other than asthma. So, while wheezing is a critical sign of possible asthma, it is not the only thing you should look for.In small babies, increased breathing rates (with or without wheezing) are sometimes one of the few apparent indicators of asthma. Babies have higher respiration rates than older kids or adults, usually about 30 to 60 breaths per minute for newborns and 20 to 40 breaths per minute for the remainder of the first year of life.If your baby is breathing at least 50% more rapidly than normal (that is, 45 to 90 breaths per minute for a newborn), you should seek medical attention. Some experts argue for an even more conservative threshold, advising that anything over 40 breaths per minute when resting comfortably or sleeping should trigger a timely medical evaluation.

, Wheezing is a common symptom in babies who have colds, and can also indicate a range of medical conditions ranging from harmless to serious. Generally speaking, a single wheezing episode (so long as it is not severe and lasts no longer than a day or two) is not a strong indicator of asthma. Multiple bouts of wheezing, however, make the possibility more likely.It can be difficult to tell if the baby is truly wheezing, or if the noises are coming from their upper airway, such as the nose. Your baby’s pediatrician can listen to your baby’s chest to determine if your baby is wheezing or not.
The Asthma Prediction Index (API), a simple but often effective diagnostic guide used regularly by physicians, considers four or more wheezing episodes within one year that last one day or more and impact sleep to be strong predictive indicators of asthma.When in doubt, seek medical advice sooner rather than later regarding wheezing episodes. Asthma and other breathing conditions can quickly turn very serious in babies.

, The more information you can provide regarding the surrounding conditions of your baby’s wheezing episodes, the more likely it is that your baby’s doctor can make an informed asthma diagnosis. Take notes and bring them to your baby’s medical appointments.Take note of whether a wheezing episode occurs in combination with a viral infection, in proximity to common allergens, or after exposure to smoke. Asthma-induced wheezing can also occur during periods of laughing, crying, or active playing. Additionally, it can become more pronounced during rapid changes in weather, in cold conditions, or at night., Asthma attacks can be serious at any age, but can be particularly dangerous for newborns and infants. Their tiny airways can become quickly blocked off during an asthmatic episode. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and seek medical help quickly, especially if you know that your child is at an elevated risk for asthma. Watch for important signs such as:Grunting when breathing or feeding.
Repeated or ongoing waves of coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
Fast breathing, especially if accompanied by a labored breathing effort. In a baby, you may see significant chest contractions that cave in the abdomen and expose the ribs. The nostrils might also flare widely.
The baby seeming very tired or very agitated due to having to work harder to breathe.
Paleness or redness in the face, or blue skin under the fingernails or the lips.
Crying that becomes soft, short, or stops altogether.
A refusal or inability to feed.

, It is difficult to diagnose asthma in children under six — and especially babies — because most of the tests require deep, directed inhaling and exhaling. An accurate diagnosis also benefits from the patient being able to describe his or her symptoms, which babies cannot do. In many cases, diagnosing asthma in babies involves a process of elimination and “educated guessing” by the doctor.The doctor will consider the baby’s allergy and health history, the family history of asthma and allergies, the results of a physical examination, and the information you provide regarding the type, timing, and location of symptoms. Blood tests and other lab work may also be conducted to reach at least a tentative diagnosis.
Your baby’s doctor may also order a chest x-ray to help with the diagnosis, and to rule-out other causes of wheezing or trouble breathing.

, Many physicians utilize the Asthma Predictive Index (API) for kids under three. This predictive tool gives a fairly accurate indication of the likelihood that a young child will develop asthma at some point. It combines factors like wheezing episodes, family history, and signs of skin conditions or allergies to calculate the likelihood.According to the API, your child has an increased likelihood of developing asthma if:


he or she has had four or more wheezing episodes in the past year that a) lasted at least one day and b) affected sleep ... AND
has one of the following: a parent with asthma, diagnosed atopic dermatitis, or evidence of air allergen sensitivity ... OR
has two of the following: evidence of food allergies, blood eosinophilia of greater than four percent, or wheezing episodes apart from colds.

, In some cases, a pediatrician may decide that it is best to “play it safe” and prescribe asthma medications even when a diagnosis is unclear. If there exists a decent likelihood that a baby has asthma, the benefits of using medications usually outweighs the risks of side effects.Your baby will usually be given medications to treat active wheezing or coughing as needed. They may also require a daily medication to help prevent symptoms.
As with asthma sufferers of all ages, the primary medications are delivered as an inhaled mist. For babies, a nebulizer and face mask are typically used, but inhalers with spacers and masks are often used for babies with good results.
The medications may also be used as a diagnostic tool for babies. Essentially, if the asthma medications alleviate or eliminate your baby’s symptoms, then your child probably has asthma.

Learn about goiter.,
Check for symptoms of goiter.,
Consider possible causes of goiter.",How to Know if You Have Thyroid Disease1," A goiter is an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is more common in women than in men. Under normal circumstances, an individual or physician cannot feel the thyroid gland, but if you have a goiter, then you will be able to feel it.


Goiter may be due to a swelling of the thyroid or multiple growths on the gland. It can also indicate hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).;
, The main symptom of goiter is the goiter, the enlarged thyroid gland that you can feel. Most individuals with goiter have no other symptoms.The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front portion of the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and just above the collarbone. If you can feel this gland, then you may have a goiter. If the goiter grows large enough, it may also cause the following symptoms:Swelling or tightness in the neck
Breathing difficulties
Swallowing difficulties
Coughing
Wheezing
Hoarseness of voice

, To help your doctor develop the best course of treatment, you should consider any preexisting conditions that you have that may have caused the goiter. Causes of goiter include:



Iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter worldwide. However, it is rare in the United States due to the fact that table salt is supplemented with iodine.Graves’ disease. Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism (overproduction of thyroid hormones). The disease causes the body to produce a protein, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that attacks the thyroid gland.The protein attacks cause swelling of the thyroid and overproduction of thyroid hormones as TSI mimics the actions of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).Other symptoms of Graves' disease include bulging eyes, anxiety, heat sensitivity, weight loss, and frequent bowel movements.Treatment for Graves' disease includes radioactive therapy that reduces thyroid activity, so you will probably need to take thyroid replacement hormones after treatment.Hashimoto’s disease. Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hypothyroidism (underproduction of thyroid hormones). The disease occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the thyroid, which leads to swelling of the gland. It progresses slowly over the years and produces chronic thyroid damage leading to low levels of thyroid hormones. The disease is also known as chronic lymphatic thyroiditis.Other symptoms of Hashimoto's disease may include fatigue, depression, joint pain, weight gain, and constipation.Thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules are lumps or abnormal masses within the thyroid gland. They may be solid or filled with fluid or blood. Individuals may have one thyroid nodule (solitary) or many. They are common and almost half of the population may have them at some point in their lives.Most thyroid nodules do not cause symptoms and 90% are benign (not cancerous).Some thyroid nodules may cause overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) and an even smaller fraction masquerade as thyroid cancer."

Anticipate a range of emotions.,
Recognize a cycle of grief and loss.,
Accept your diagnosis.,
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Take good care of yourself.,
Remember that you are more than your disease.,
Recognize that you will have good days and bad days.",How to Live With a Chronic Illness2," When you learn that you have a chronic illness, you may be surprised by the range of emotions you experience. Experiencing this range of emotions is normal. These emotions are often similar to the emotions that someone feels when they lose a loved one. Some of the emotions you might experience include:Denial
Desperation
Anger
Depression
Anxiety
Confusion

, People who suffer from a chronic illness often experience a cycle of grief and loss due to their illness and its effects. The grief may be the result of a loss of function, concerns about dying, or changes in their relationships. Keep in mind that these feelings are a normal part of this process.Look for ways to cope with your grief. For example, you might find it helpful to start a journal to express your feelings, or start a creative hobby to help you express your feelings, such as painting or playing an instrument.

, There are many emotions that you might feel when you are diagnosed, but no matter how you feel, you can take charge of your illness. While there may be parts of your life that you cannot control, think about the things in your life that you can control, such as your diet, exercise, hobbies, and social activities. Before each visit with your doctor, prepare a list of questions for your doctor.You might ask:


Can I still do my favorite activities, such as sports, hiking, gardening, etc.?
What are the side effects of the medication? Is there any way I can reduce my risk of these side effects?
Other than taking my medicine, what can I do to relieve my symptoms?
Should I exercise? If so, what types of exercise are most beneficial for this condition?

, The first step to combating negative emotions is to understand what they are. Many people feel fear, anxiety, anger, and depression after their diagnosis, but these can be overcome.Some ways that you can confront your emotions include:


Writing daily in a journal
Meditating
Talking to family and friends

, When you are suffering from a chronic illness, taking good care of yourself is crucial. Make sure that you are doing things to benefit your physical, emotional, and spiritual health on a daily basis. Some things you can do to take good care of yourself include:



Eating healthy foods.

Exercising regularly, such as by taking a daily walk.

Using relaxation techniques to manage stress, such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation.

Getting plenty of sleep.
Doing things that make you happy, such as engaging in a favorite hobby or spending time with friends.

, Focusing on who you are outside of your illness helps you feel like a human being, not a list of symptoms, treatments and test results.If you are feeling sad about your illness, do an activity that you love or call a family member. To help you focus on your identity outside of your illness, you might consider asking yourself:


What are my talents and strengths? What special skills do I have?
Who do I love in my life? Who do I have that I can depend on? Who depends on me?
What do I love to do? What hobbies do I have?
What are three words that I would use to describe myself?

, Medications and other treatments can keep your symptoms under control, but you might have periods where your symptoms will flare up. These flares could be caused by changes to your medication or treatment plan, disruptions in your schedule, physical changes within your body, or exposure to something, such as an allergen, that triggers an attack. Understand that these flare ups are natural. They do not necessarily mean that your disease is worsening. You might, however, need to contact your physician and make changes to your treatment plan.

"
Discuss your illness with loved ones.,
Join a support group.,
Speak to a therapist.,
Contact a local organization.",How to Live With a Chronic Illness3," You should let your closest family and friends understand that you have an illness. Explain to them what the condition is and how it affects you. You might want to explain what causes it, how it is treated, and how it might affect your daily life. Ask them if they are willing to help work with you to manage your symptoms. This will let them know why you must do certain things, and they may be able to help you manage your symptoms.If you need time to rest or recuperate, let them know. For example, you can say, ""I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This means that I need to sleep every night, and I will probably need naps throughout the day. I don't want you to feel that I am ignoring you because I can't go out at night.""
If you have a severe allergy, explain to them that you cannot have that specific food or allergen around you. You can say, ""I could have a severe reaction if there are peanuts around. I would really appreciate it if you would not bring peanuts into the house, or if you could brush your teeth before coming to see me.""

, Patient-to-patient support groups provide you with a network of others with the same condition. You might learn helpful tips about managing your condition, such as how to plan your day, reduce your symptoms, and cope with the bad days.Ask your doctor if they know about any local support groups. Local hospitals might also have a group you can join. If not, you can look on the internet for an online support group. You can even start one yourself.

, If you are feeling depressed or uncontrollably angry about your illness, you may need to speak to a therapist. They can help you manage your emotions in a healthy way that will allow you to focus on both your physical and mental health,Your doctor can refer you to a good psychologist. The American Psychological Association also offers a psychologist locator tool on their website., If you are struggling to find accommodation for your illness, you may need to contact a local organization, non-profit, or research foundation that specializes in your chronic condition. Some well-known organizations include:


Cystic Fibrosis FoundationAmerican Diabetes AssociationAsthma and Allergy Foundation of AmericaLupus Foundation of AmericaAmerican Cancer SocietyNational Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain AssociationNational Multiple Sclerosis SocietyRobert Wood Johnson Foundation’s programs for Improving Chronic Illness Care"
"
Inform your workplace or school.,
Contact the Job Accommodation Network.,
Take time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act.",How to Live With a Chronic Illness4," Your employer or school should know about your illness and the types of treatment that you have to receive on a daily basis. Let them know what they might need to do in case of an emergency. Do let them know how your condition might impact your work, if at all. You might be able to negotiate some sort of accommodation, whether it is short medication breaks, the ability to eat during class, or extra time to arrive at places.At school, you should contact administration with a doctor’s note explaining the disease. You can say, ""My epilepsy might cause me to have a seizure during class. If this happens, please let the teacher know what they can do to help me.""
At universities, you can contact the office of disability services (sometimes known as accessibility services) and the Dean’s Office. You can say, ""My arthritis means that I can't always write notes during the lecture. Can I have another student take notes for me so that I do not fall behind?""
At work, you should approach HR or your boss. You can say, ""Sometimes, when my blood sugar drops, I will need to take a short break to eat something. This shouldn't interfere with my work, but I will need to be allowed to keep food at my desk.""

, The US Department of Labor operates a service known as the Job Accommodation Network (JAN). This service provides guidance on disability accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Some chronic conditions do qualify as disabilities, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, asthma, and cystic fibrosis.You can call or email JAN for information about your specific situation. There is also a list of resources available on their website., The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows American workers up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave to help treat serious medical conditions. You may need to provide your employer with thirty days’ notice or medical certification.Any disease that requires periodic doctor's visits counts as a serious condition. This means that you must go to a doctor at least twice a year to treat this condition. While circumstances vary from situation to situation, some conditions that typically qualify include ALS, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma."

Learn about hyperthyroidism.,
Check for symptoms of hyperthyroidism.,
Consider your risk factors.",How to Know if You Have Thyroid Disease2," Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, results from the overproduction of thyroid hormones. As a result, the body’s metabolism is elevated. The disease is characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which causes inflammation of the thyroid and excess production of hormones.Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism.
The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States is the autoimmune disorder Graves’ disease., Hyperthyroidism causes a wide range of symptoms, so it may be difficult to tell if you have hyperthyroidism based on symptoms alone. You will need to see your doctor for tests to determine if hyperthyroidism is the cause of your symptoms. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include:Weight loss
Fatigue
Rapid heartbeat
Irregular heartbeat
Anxiety or nervousness
Irritability
Protruding eyes
Trouble sleeping
Trembling in the hand and fingers
Increased sweating
Feeling hot when others do not
Muscle weakness
Diarrhea
Change in menstrual cycles
Weak bones
Infertility
Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)
Erectile dysfunction
Decreased sexual libido

, Some people are at higher risk of developing hyperthyroidism due to certain risk factors. Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include:


Advancing age
Female gender
Family history of hyperthyroidism
Iodine supplementation after deficiency
Autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus

Consider your risk factors.",How to Know if You Have Thyroid Disease3," Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, results from the underproduction of thyroid hormones. As a result, the body’s metabolism is slowed. Some of the symptoms are just the opposite of what happens with hyperthyroidism.


The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s disease. The disease causes chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland which decreases its ability to produce hormones., Symptoms of hypothyroidism usually appear slowly over months or years. Like hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism symptoms have a wide range so you will need to see your doctor to confirm that hypothyroidism is the cause of your symptoms. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include:Fatigue
Feeling cold when others do not
Constipation
Weight gain
Poor concentration
Muscle weakness
Joint pain
Muscle pain
Depression
Dry, thinning hair
Pale, dry skin

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Request blood tests.,
Ask about imaging tests.,
Consider a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy if needed.",How to Know if You Have Thyroid Disease4," If you suspect that you have thyroid disease, make an appointment with your doctor right away to get a diagnosis and treatment if needed. Thyroid disease can be diagnosed using a variety of methods. Make sure that you tell your doctor about all of the symptoms that you are experiencing.

, Several blood tests can be used to diagnose thyroid disease. Your doctor will most likely order blood tests first because they are easy to perform and they can determine whether or not your symptoms are due to a thyroid issue. These tests include:Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This test is always the first step in diagnosing a thyroid problem. The TSH blood test is the most accurate test for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Low TSH correlates with hyperthyroidism, while high TSH correlates with hypothyroidism. If the results of the TSH test are abnormal, then your doctor may order additional tests to pinpoint the cause of the problem.

Thyroxine (T4). A blood test that reveals low levels of T4 correlates with hypothyroidism, while a test that reveals high levels correlates with hyperthyroidism.

Triiodothyronine (T3). A T3 blood test can also be useful for confirming hyperthyroidism. If T3 levels are elevated, it indicates that you have hyperthyroidism. A T3 blood test cannot be used for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). A TSI blood test can help to confirm Graves’ disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.
Antithyroid antibody. The anti-thyroid antibody test can help to confirm Hashimoto’s disease, the most common cause of hypothyroidism.

, A variety of imaging tests may also be used to diagnose and pinpoint the cause of thyroid disease. Your doctor may order one or more of these if the results of a blood test come back as abnormal. Imaging tests may include:



Ultrasound. Ultrasound utilizes sound waves that bounce off organs to create images of their structure. The images can help practitioners look at the tissue within the thyroid gland. It can also reveal nodules, cysts, or calcifications within the gland. However, ultrasound cannot distinguish between a benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous) growth.Computed tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan with or without contrast may be used to look at the tissues of a large goiter. They may also reveal thyroid nodules in individuals having the scans for unrelated reasons.Thyroid scan with radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). A thyroid scan is a type of nuclear imaging study that utilizes radioactive iodine to evaluate the structure and function of the thyroid gland. These tests may be used to assess the nature of a thyroid nodule or help diagnose hyperthyroidism., Since it is difficult or even impossible to tell if a growth is cancerous using imaging along, your doctor may order a FNA biopsy to determine whether a thyroid nodule is benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).


During this procedure, a small, thin needle attached to a syringe will be inserted into the thyroid nodule using ultrasound guidance.
Samples of the cells in the nodule will be pulled into the syringe and then sent for analysis.
The cells will be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist, a specialist in the study of diseases, who will determine if the cells are benign or malignant."

Follow R.I.C.E.,
Rest the your forearm.,
Ice the injured area for up to 20 minutes, several times a day.,
Compress the area until the swelling goes down.,
Elevate the affected area.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever or anti-inflammatory medication.",How to Treat Forearm Tendonitis1," R.I.C.E. stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. This principle can be used at home to treat forearm Tendinitis and should be practiced on a daily basis for the best results., Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating Tendinitis, especially in athletes.Athletes who continue to push through tendon pain risk escalating their injury from the acute inflammation phase to chronic Tendinitis, which is much harder to treat.Avoid in sports or strenuous physical activity. Don’t try to play through the pain.
Small amounts of activity can still be done by patients with forearm tendinitis. Complete abstinence from using the affected area can cause muscle stiffness. Try low impact activities like swimming and gentle stretches to keep your muscles active without putting too much stress or use on them., Use an ice pack, wrapped in a towel, or give your forearm an ice massage, or a slush bath with ice and water. This will decrease the pain, muscle spasms, and swelling of your forearm.To apply an ice massage, freeze a plastic foam cup of water. Hold the cup while applying the ice directly to the skin of your forearm.
You can use frozen bag of vegetables such as peas.

, Swelling can result in a loss of motion in the injured joint. Use a compression wrap or a compressive elastic bandage (available at any pharmacy) on your forearm until it appears less swollen., Elevating your forearm will help to reduce the pain and swelling. Raise the affected forearm above the level of your heart on a chair or a stack of pillows., Ibuprofen, Aspirin or other anti-inflammatory medication will help with the pain and swelling in the short term (five to seven days).Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is a very effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication. You can usually take two pills at a time, and repeat every four to six hours.
Naproxen sodium (Aleve) is another anti-inflammatory medication. You may take this every 12 hours as needed for pain and swelling.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is another effective pain reliever that can be used to ease the discomfort associated with forearm tendinitis.

Stretch the extensor muscles of your forearm.,
Do a forearm flexor stretch.,
Strengthen your forearm extensor muscles.,
Strengthen your forearm flexors.,
Do deviator muscle exercises.,
Exercise your pronator and supinator muscles.",How to Treat Forearm Tendonitis2," Stretching is a good way to strengthen your forearm muscles and release any pain or stress. A constant stretching and strengthening routine can help to alleviate forearm Tendinitis.Your extensor muscles help you extend your wrist and are important for healthy forearm muscles.


Sit in a chair and rest your elbow on a flat table or surface.
Straighten your arm out fully. Your wrist should extend beyond the edge of the table.
Push the palm of your hand down with your opposite hand.
You should feel a stretch across the top of your forearm and bent hand. Hold the stretch for 15 seconds and repeat it two to three times on each arm.
You can also do this stretch while standing, or while doing a light jog on a treadmill or in place., These are the muscles that help you flex the wrist.


Sit in a chair with your elbow resting on a table or flat surface.
Straighten the arm out fully with your palm facing up.
Your wrist should extend beyond the edge of the table.
Push your palm downward with your opposite hand to stretch the forearm flexors. Hold the stretch for 15 seconds and repeat it two to three times on each arm.
You can also do this stretch while standing, or while doing a light jog on a treadmill or in place., Always do stretching exercises first, before you do any strengthening exercises. Use a .5 lb or 1lb weight to do these exercises. In a pinch, you can also use a soup can or a light weight hammer.


Sit in a chair with your forearm resting on a flat table or surface.
Your wrist should extend past the edge of the table.
Extend your forearm fully with your palm facing downwards.
Grasping a weight in your hand, extend your wrist upward.
Hold this position for two seconds and then release slowly. Repeat the exercise 30 to 50 times, twice a day. However, if you feel any pain while doing these exercises, lessen the amount of times you do them in a day.

, Use a .5lb or 1lb weight to do this exercise.

Hold the weight in your hand with the thumb facing up.
Move your wrist up and down, much like hammering a nail.
All the motion should occur at your wrist joint, not at the elbow or shoulder joint. Repeat the exercise 30 to 50 times, twice a day. Lessen the number of reps if you feel any pain.

, These are the muscles that allow you to turn your hand over.


Hold a .5 lb or 1 lb weight in your hand with your thumb pointing up.
Turn your wrist inward as far as possible and hold for two seconds.
Turn your wrist outward as far as possible and hold for two seconds.
Repeat up to 50 repetitions. Lessen the number of reps if you feel any pain.

See a doctor if your pain persists, or you experience extreme symptoms.,
Ask your doctor about corticosteroids.,
Consider physical therapy.,
Ask your doctor about surgical treatment.",How to Treat Forearm Tendonitis3," If you experience significant joint problems, severe pain, redness, swelling, or loss of joint function, you may have advanced Tendinitis and likely require medical care.Provide a detailed list of your symptoms and the duration of your symptoms. For example: “constant pain in the right forearm for two hours” or “swelling of the left forearm at the end of the day”.
Tell your physician about any treatments you have tried or used at home.
Describe your daily activities to your physician, as Tendinitis can be caused or exacerbated by excessive activity.

, Steroid injections around the tendon may help to reduce swelling and ease pain. These treatments are not recommended for chronic tendinitis lasting three months or longer. Repeated injections can weaken your tendons and increase your risk of rupturing the tendon. Therefore, it is recommended that corticosteroids be avoided., Your doctor may recommend physical therapy for your forearm tendinitis. The physiotherapist will then develop a program with specific exercises designed to stretch and strengthen your forearm muscles.Physical therapy sessions may be several times a week for several months.
Rest, stretching, and strengthening are the mainstays for this treatment.

, Depending on how severe and chronic your tendon injury is, surgery may be an option, especially if a tendon has torn away from the bone.


Focused aspiration of scar tissue (FAST) may be necessary to treat chronic tendinitis. This procedure is a minimally invasive surgery that uses ultrasound guidance and small instruments, and is performed under local anesthesia.
The goal of this surgery is to remove tendon scar tissue without damaging the surrounding tissues.
Most people return to normal activity within one to two months following FAST treatment.

Seek medical attention if you think you have dry gangrene.,
Go to an emergency room if you have wet gangrene.,
Watch for severe symptoms.",How to Treat Gangrene1," Gangrene can result from skin problems or changes, or in some cases from of limb ischemia (blockage of the arteries to lower legs and feet). All types of gangrene require professional medical treatment. If you suspect that you have dry gangrene, even if it is a mild case, then you should call your doctor as soon as possible. Symptoms of dry gangrene include:dry and shriveled skin that sloughs off easily
bluish or blackish colored skin
cold, numb skin
pain (sometimes, but not always present);
, While all types of gangrene require swift medical treatment, wet gangrene is more likely to be accompanied by an infection, which can be difficult to treat if it gets into your blood. Injuries may also cause wet gangrene, so you may require immediate treatment for that reason as well.Seek emergency medical treatment if you notice any of the following symptoms of wet gangrene:swelling and pain in the infected area
skin that has changed from red to brown to black
blisters or sores accompanied by bad-smelling discharge (pus)
fever
feeling sick in general
crackling sound when you press on the affected area

, If you determine that you have gangrene, there are some symptoms may indicate that the gangrene has infected your blood, which requires immediate medical attention. If you notice any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to an emergency room right away.low blood pressure
rapid heartbeat
difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
a sudden change in body temperature
pain in your body
a rash
confusion and/or light-headedness
cold, clammy, pale skin

Take antibiotics and other medications as instructed.,
Undergo wound debridement and irrigation.,
Undergo oxygen therapy.,
Consider other therapies.,
Discuss amputation with your doctor.,
Treat the condition that is causing gangrene to develop.",How to Treat Gangrene2," Your doctor may give you an intravenous antibiotic or instruct you to take antibiotics orally as part of your treatment. You may also be administered medications to regulate your blood sugar, since blood sugar regulation and short term glycemic control improve long term outcomes when it comes to healing and preventing infection. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking antibiotics and any other medications that your doctor prescribes to help treat your gangrene.If you have side effects or feel like you do not need the medication any more, call you doctor before discontinuing them.
Do not stop taking antibiotics until you have taken the entire prescription. Otherwise, they may not be effective and the infection may be harder to treat in the future.

, Wounds with devitalized tissue, contamination, or residual suture need debridement before any other work is completed. Irrigation is important in removing the bacterial load and removing loose material.In surgical debridement, a scalpel or scissors is used to remove devitalized tissue or unwanted debris.
Enzymatic debridement involves applying various enzymatic agents to the wound.

, Sometimes oxygen therapy may be used to help promote healing of damaged tissues. For this treatment, you will be placed into a special chamber that is filled with oxygen. The concentration of oxygen will be much higher in this chamber than in the normal environment, which is thought to help you heal faster and more effectively.Oxygen therapy may assist in wound healing and help to reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be amputated.Oxygen therapy was has also been found to be extremely useful in surgical wound infections involving the Clostridium species that cause “gas gangrene,” which is a form of gangrene that develops inside the body., Biologic therapy such as maggot therapy, has been used to treat ulcers, chronic venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and other acute and chronic wounds. Recombinant human growth factors are now being examined as potential treatments for wound management. These factors include platelet derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. Your doctor may recommend trying one of these treatments to promote healing.


Try to keep an open mind about maggot therapy. Sterile, lab raised maggots are often used to treat gangrene. Because maggots will only eat dead tissue, they can be applied to the affected tissues and allowed to eat away the dead skin. This process can also help your body to heal itself and help to prevent infection., Surgery may also be required to remove the affected tissues from your body. If not removed, the gangrene is likely to spread and cause further harm to the rest of your body and possibly even death. Therefore, it may be necessary for your doctor to remove a finger, toe, foot, or limb in order to treat the gangrene.Keep in mind that even when interventions are successful to open up an artery and reestablish blood flow to the affected area, surgical removal of dead tissues is still used for gangrene in almost every case., Causes of gangrene include diabetes, atherosclerosis of the limbs, peripheral artery disease, smoking, trauma, obesity, and Raynaud's Disease. It may be necessary to treat the underlying condition with medication or surgery in order to restore normal blood flow to the affected tissues and improve your future health. Discuss treatment options with your doctor."

Get tested if you see symptoms.,
Test newborn babies.,
Examine pregnant women.,
Watch for signs in children and teens.,

Examine yourself at home.,
Screen your family and medical history.,
Get a physical exam.,
Take blood tests.,
Take drugs.,
Continue treatment.,
Think about the future.",How to Test for Hypothyroidism," Symptoms develop slowly over a number of years. Many of the symptoms can also be associated with many other types of conditions, but any combination of fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, muscle stiffness or weakness, thinning hair, depression, and/or impaired memory will mostly likely lead you to hypothyroidism. If left untreated, hypothyroidism can become a serious problem. Physically, it could lead to a goiter and mentally lead to depression.
Myxedema, or advanced hypothyroidism, is rare but can become life-threatening. Low blood pressure, decreased breathing, lowered body temperature, unresponsiveness, and a coma are signs and symptoms of the advanced stage that could ultimately lead to death.;
, Because of the risk of intellectual disability in infants, get your newborn tested while still in the hospital. An early diagnosis, within the first month of life, will make it easy for your baby to reverse any effects of hypothyroidism. A simple blood test can detect the condition and then, once the proper medication is prescribed, your doctor will monitor the thyroid hormone levels with regularly scheduled blood tests. Newborns who suffer from hypothyroidism will exhibit jaundice, frequent choking, a large, protruding tongue, and a puffy face.
If the condition progresses, your infant may have trouble feeding, constipation, poor muscle tone, or be excessively sleepy.
If untreated, hypothyroidism could lead to severe physical and mental underdevelopment.

, If you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant then you should test your thyroid. Thyroid disease is common in women of childbearing age. Therefore, this condition could dramatically impact both mother and baby during the course of pregnancy. All pregnant women with an enlarged thyroid (goiter), family history of hypothyroidism, or high blood levels of thyroid antibodies should get tested.
Ask your doctor for selenium supplementation if you have high antibody levels at the time of preconception.
Women taking thyroid hormone replacement prior to pregnancy need to monitor their levels, especially during the first trimester. Doses might increase as the pregnancy progresses.
After delivery (postpartum hypothyroidism), women may experience depression, memory and concentration issues, or thyroid enlargement.

, Children and teens will experience the same signs and symptoms as adults, but since they are still growing and have very active thyroid glands, they may also suffer poor growth resulting in shorter stature, delayed development of their teeth, slowed mental development, or a longer time period to enter puberty. Children with hypothyroidism need to see a doctor regularly because, as they grow, the dosage of medication will change. Severe consequences may occur if the dosage is incorrect.

, People with conditions such as Down syndrome or Turner syndrome or those taking certain medications (amiodarone, lithium, thalidomide, interferon, sunitinib, and rifampicin) or treatments (radiation therapy to neck, radioiodine treatment, subtotal thyroidectomy), should be screened yearly for hypothyroidism.Screening those who are not at risk and show no symptoms provides little benefit and is not encouraged.Women who are over 50 and have one or more symptoms, however, should be screened., If you are exhibiting a combination of the symptoms associated with hypothyroidism, you might want to take some preliminary measures to determine if you have the condition. A noninvasive way of determining if you have hypothyroidism is to check your basal body temperature (BBT is your lowest body temperature in a 24 hour period) at home. To get an accurate reading, you must take your temperature when you first wake up in the morning, before you even sit up in bed. Keep it under your arm for ten minutes.
Perform this for four consecutive days and write it down. Your normal temperature should be between 97.8 and 98.2°F (36.6 and 36.8°C). If your temperature is below 97.8°F *(36.6°C), your thyroid could be underperforming. Check with your doctor of thyroid supplements.
Remember, hypothyroidism cannot be confirmed as a condition with home testing alone. Only an official blood test conducted by your doctor can confirm any type of diagnosis. Even if home testing does not reveal hypothyroidism, you should remain wary since it is extremely difficult to detect and oftentimes takes several years to fully develop.

, Since many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism are common complaints found in people that do not have a problem with their thyroid, an intense, detail-oriented medical history is conducted by your doctor. Make sure you remember how long your symptoms have been bothering you. Doctors will pay particular attention to whether you mother or a close relative was ever diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Try to find this information before going to see your doctor.
Cancer survivors, especially those who received radiation around the neck, or neck surgery, will be closely scrutinized.Another important red flag is medication that could cause hypothyroidism, such as amiodarone, lithium, interferon alpha, or interleukin-2., A physical exam will take place after screening your family and medical history to check for symptoms. Your doctor will be checking for evidence of dry skin, swelling around the eyes and legs, slow reflexes, and a slow heart rate. , If the results from your history and physical exams lead your doctor to suspect you have hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism, you will have blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. There are two main blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test and the Thyroxine (T4) measurement. If the tests come back atypical, anti-thyroid antibody tests may determine whether you have the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis, in which the body's defense system attacks the thyroid gland.
Ultrasound is only used in rare cases to evaluate a thyroid gland that appears abnormal. Instead, a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may be done to look for any changes in these areas of the brain.

, Standard treatment for hypothyroidism is an oral medication that restores your hormone levels to their proper levels. You will need to take the thyroid hormone levothyroxine on a daily basis to reverse the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. After starting treatment, you will have regular visits with your doctor to make sure you have the right dose of medicine. In most cases, your symptoms will begin to abate and you will gain some energy back two to six weeks after beginning treatment.
Another benefit to this drug treatment is the lowering of cholesterol, which may reduce weight gained during the pregnancy.
Infants and children with hypothyroidism should always be treated.

, Taking levothyroxine is often for life, but the dosage size could become less over time. For older adults, the reverse happens. It is common that hypothyroidism gets worse with age requiring higher dosages because the thyroid slows down naturally. Taking medicine everyday for the rest of your life is no easy chore and as physical symptoms disappear, you might be tempted to stop taking your medication. In this case, the symptoms will reappear and you will have to start all over again.
The thyroid often returns to normal if the cause of your hypothyroidism was a result of a serious illness or infection.
You may briefly stop taking your medication to see if your thyroid is functioning normally. If the thyroid can produce enough hormones by itself, treatment can end.
Continue checkups annually while on medication.

, Be careful about which foods you eat and whether to take supplement or not with your medication. It is important that you continue to take your thyroid medication properly. If you are confused as to why you are taking it or the possible side effects, contact your doctor. Avoid taking iron and calcium supplements with your medication because they reduce the amount of thyroid hormone absorbed by the body. Calcium supplements, however, can be taken prior to or after four hours of taking medication.
Foods such as walnuts, soybean flour, and cottonseed meal should also be avoided because they could interact with your medication and, therefore, reduce its overall effectiveness.
If you take birth control pills or other hormone medication, talk to your doctor about adjusting the dose of your medicine.
Many health food stores carry “natural” ingredient thyroid hormone supplements. These products are unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, be wary of the quality and effectiveness of these products. Some do have active ingredients that work, but can still be dangerous to certain people. Consult your doctor if you are interested in these supplements.

Maintain a healthy immune system.,
Get plenty of vitamin C. Although there is not much research investigating the effects of vitamin C on viruses not associated with causing the common cold, it's clear that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has potent antiviral and immune boosting properties, both of which are helpful for preventing or minimizing the effects of EBV infections.More specifically, vitamin C stimulates the production and activity of specialized white blood cells, which seek out and destroy viruses.,
Consider immune boosting supplements.,
Be careful who you kiss.,
Treat symptoms if they are significant.,
Consider colloidal silver.,
Consult with your doctor if your infection is chronic.",How to Treat Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)," For any type of infection (viral, bacterial or fungal), true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune response. Your immune system consists of specialized white blood cells that search for and attempt to destroy potential pathogens such as EBV, but when the system is weakened, harmful microorganisms grow and spread virtually unchecked.As such, focusing on ways to keep your immune system strong and functioning properly is a logical and natural approach to preventing EBV and virtually all other infectious diseases.


Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating more fresh fruit and veggies, practicing good hygiene, drinking lots of purified water, and regular cardiovascular exercise are all proven ways to keep your immune system function the way it was designed to.Your immune system will also benefit from cutting down on refined sugars (soda pop, candy, ice cream, most baked goods), reducing your alcohol consumption, and refraining from smoking tobacco products.
In addition to poor lifestyle choices, people's immune systems can be compromised by severe stress, debilitating diseases (cancer, diabetes, other infections), and certain medical procedures or prescriptions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, steroids, over-medicating).;
, Recommended daily intake of vitamin C ranges from 75 mg to 125 mg (depending on gender and whether or not you smoke), but there's growing concern within healthcare circles that amount may not always be enough for optimum health and immune function.To combat infections, consider taking at least 1,000 mg daily in two divided doses.
Excellent natural sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, kiwis, strawberries, tomatoes, and broccoli.

, In addition to vitamin C, there are many other vitamins, minerals, and herbal preparations that display antiviral and immune boosting properties. Unfortunately, none of them have been rigorously studied in relation to preventing or combating EBV. High-quality scientific research is expensive and natural or ""alternative"" therapies for diseases and conditions are typically not high on the list of mainstream medicine to investigate. Furthermore, EBV is unusual in that it likes to hide inside B cells – a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune response.As such, EBV is difficult to eradicate simply by boosting immunity, but it's certainly worth a try.


Other immune boosting supplements include vitamins A and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract, and astragalus root.Vitamin D3 is produced in your skin in response to intense summer sunshine and a necessary part of a healthy immune system — consider supplementing with D3 during winter months or year-round if you are not exposed to at least 15 minutes of direct sunshine every day.
Olive leaf extract is a strong antiviral made from olive trees and it may work synergistically with vitamin C., The vast majority of teenagers and adults (not just in the U.S., but other countries too) have been infected with EBV at some stage. Some fight it off effectively with no symptoms, some contract it and have mild symptoms, and some are ill for weeks or months. As such, not kissing or having sexual contact with anyone is a great way to prevent EBV and other viral infections, but it's not very realistic or practical advice. Instead, avoid romantically kissing people who appear to be ill, especially if they have a sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and are always tired or fatigued. However, keep in mind that EBV can spread without the presence of any obvious symptoms.Although nicknamed the ""kissing disease,"" EBV infection can also spread via saliva from sharing beverages and utensils, as well as via other body fluids during sexual relations.
While most Americans have been infected with EBV, mononucleosis appears more common in Caucasian than in African-American populations.Other risk factors for EBV infection include being female, living in tropical climates, and being sexually active.

, There is no standard medical treatment for EBV because it often doesn't cause symptoms, and even mononucleosis is self-limiting and tends to go away within a few months.However, if your symptoms are causing significant discomfort, then acetaminophen (Tylenol) and anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen) can be used to treat high fevers, inflamed lymph nodes and throat pain. For severe throat swelling, your doctor may prescribe a short course of steroidal-type drugs. Bed rest isn't often recommended, although some people with mononucleosis often feel exhausted.


EBV leads to mononucleosis in about 1/3 to 1/2 of teenagers and adults infected with the virus — common symptoms include fever, sore throat, swollen lymph glands and severe fatigue.Keep in mind that many over-the-counter medications for adults should not be given to children (aspirin in particular).
In up to 1/2 of mononucleosis cases the spleen becomes swollen due to filtering all the abnormal blood cells out of the blood.Avoid excessive activity and any trauma to the abdomen if your spleen is inflamed (the area below your heart).
Rare complications related to EBV include brain inflammation (encephalitis or meningitis), lymphoma, and some other cancers.

, Colloidal silver is a liquid preparation containing small atomic clusters of electrically charged silver. The medical literature shows numerous viruses successfully treated with silver solutions, but efficacy depends on size (particles should be less than 10nm in diameter) and purity (no salts or protein in the solution).Subnanometer-sized silver particles become highly electrically charged and can destroy the most rapidly mutating viral pathogens. However, it's unknown if and how silver particles specifically destroy EBV, so more research is currently needed before any definitive recommendations can be made.


Silver solutions are generally considered non-toxic even in high concentrations, but protein-based solutions increase risk of argyria — discoloration due to the silver compounds getting trapped within the skin.
Colloidal silver products are widely available in health and supplements stores.

, If your EBV infection or mononucleosis persists for many months, then ask your doctor about the effectiveness of antivirals or other potent medications. Chronic EBV infection is not common, but when it persists for many months it has a significantly negative impact on the immune system and quality of life. Anecdotal reports suggest that antiviral therapy (acyclovir, ganciclovir, vidarabine, foscarnet) might be effective in some cases of chronic EBV infection.However, keep in mind that antiviral therapy is generally ineffective for less serious cases of the disease. In addition, immunosuppressive agents (corticosteroids, cyclosporine) can be used to temporarily reduce symptoms in patients with chronic EBV infection.Drugs that suppress immunity can also inhibit the immune response to EBV and may allow virus-infected cells to proliferate further, so ask your doctor if the risk is worth it.
Common side effects from taking antivirals include skin rash, stomach upset, diarrhea, fatigue, joint pain, headache, and dizziness.
There have been substantial efforts to develop vaccines against EBV, but none are currently effective.

Go immediately to the doctor or call emergency responders if you experience chest pain.,
Take prescription antibiotics if recommended by your doctor.,
Discuss prescription drug options with your doctor.,
Consider more invasive procedures to combat the pain.,
Discuss surgical options for removing or repairing the damaged cartilage if nothing else works.,
Rest to give your body time to heal.,
Apply heat to the area that is sore.,
Put an ice pack on the affected joint.,
Stretch tightened chest muscles around the joint.,
Experiment with different positions when you sleep until you find one that minimizes your discomfort.,
Improve your posture to reduce the strain on your chest.,
Try over-the-counter painkillers.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Be aware that because the main symptom is chest pain, it can be hard to tell the difference between costochondritis and the onset of a heart attack.,
Know what can cause costochondritis.",How to Treat Costochondritis," A medical professional will be able to determine whether it is a heart attack or something less serious like costochondritis.


Know what to expect at the doctor’s office. The doctor will likely palpate (examine with her fingers) along your sternum to determine where it hurts and the extent of the inflammation. If she is able to reproduce the pain while palpating, it is likely costochondritis and not a heart attack. She will also likely ask about events in your life, like recent injuries, which might be the cause.
Your doctor may ask you to undergo other tests to rule out other conditions frequently associated with chest pain, including osteoarthritis, lung disease, gastrointestinal conditions, or an infection of the joint. She may request x-rays, CT scans, an MRI, or an electrocardiograph.Tell your doctor if you have heart, liver, or kidney disease, high blood pressure, ulcers, or have had internal bleeding in the past. This knowledge will help your doctor tailor your pain management plan to what is right for you.;
, If your case of costochondritis is caused by an infection in the joint, then your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to be taken either orally or through an IV.This is usually not necessary, as infections are rarely the cause of costochondritis.

, If your pain does not go away after a few weeks and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not been effective, your doctor may suggest something stronger to help you cope with the pain. Possible prescription medications may include:Prescription-strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) similar to ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). If you take these for a long period of time you must be observed by a doctor because they can harm your stomach and kidneys.
Medications containing codeine, like Vicodin, Percocet, etc. These medications can be addictive.
Some antidepressants or anti-seizure medications can also be effective in managing chronic pain.

, Most cases of costochondritis heal on their own over time. But if the pain remains unbearable, your doctor may suggest:Injection of a corticosteroid and a numbing medication directly into the joint that hurts.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This technique uses weak electrical signals to interrupt the pain signals and prevent them from registering in your brain.

, This is sometimes necessary, particularly if the cartilage has been badly damaged by an infection.When combined with antibiotics, the outcome is usually very good.
After you recover, go for yearly check-ups to make sure that the joint remains healthy.

, This may mean that you have to refrain from strenuous sports for several weeks.Costochondritis is usually due to activities that stretch the cartilage and muscles around the chest wall. The number one doctor-prescribed treatment is avoidance or rest from the activity that is causing the discomfort. The pain usually goes away after a few days or weeks, but it could take up to a few months.Rest until you no longer feel pain.
Reintroduce physical activity into your life slowly to give yourself time to build up lost muscle and stamina.
Be particularly careful of activities that require sudden, sharp moves, high stress on your chest muscles, or put you at risk of receiving blows to the chest. These include tennis, baseball, golf, basketball, and karate.

, This may help increase the blood flow and relax muscles that may be tight.Use a hot water bottle or a heating blanket.
Do not apply the heat source directly to your skin. If you use a hot water bottle, wrap it in a towel to protect you from burning yourself.
Apply the heat for several minutes and then remove it to give your skin a chance to cool down.

, The joint is the sore area where your sternum and ribs connect. The ice will help reduce the swelling and soothe the inflammation.A bag of frozen peas or corn wrapped in a towel makes a quick, handy ice pack.
Do not apply the ice pack directly to your skin.
After 15–20 minutes, remove the ice pack and give your skin a chance to warm up. Repeat this three to four times daily.

, But be careful to do so slowly, gently, and only with a doctor's approval. The doctor may send you to a specialist to learn what types of exercises would best suit your injury.Start easy by stretching your chest muscles with slow deep breaths.
When you feel ready, add pectoral muscle stretches. An easy way to do this is to brace your forearm against a doorway and then slowly lean forward until you feel the muscles below and around your shoulders stretch.Yoga poses combined with deep breathing are an excellent way to both relax and stretch. Try the Sphinx pose. Lie on your stomach while supporting yourself on your elbows. Then open your chest, stretching up and backwards.
If the exercises hurt, stop immediately to avoid hurting yourself.

, Try to avoid positions that put pressure on the painful joint.


It will probably be uncomfortable to sleep on your stomach.

, Sitting or standing with a hunched posture is likely to aggravate your costochondritis and increase your discomfort.Practice sitting, standing, and walking with a book balanced on your head.
Concentrate on opening your chest and letting your shoulders roll back.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are most likely to be effective. Ask your doctor if he recommends using nonprescription painkillers. These medications may provide you with some relief.If you are taking prescription medicines for this or any other condition, consult with your doctor before starting any over-the-counter medications. Your doctor will be able to advise you of any potential interactions between the over-the-counter medications and your other medications.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and consult your doctor if you will take them for more than a few days. Do not take more than the instructions say.
Talk to your doctor before using these medications, even over-the-counter medications, if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or are prone to stomach ulcers or internal bleeding.

, Costochondritis can cause extreme discomfort. Sufferers describe the pain as:A sharp, aching, or pressure-like pain located on the side of the breastbone. Common locations are the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs.The pain may also spread to your stomach or back. The pain may span more than one rib joint and be aggravated by coughing or deep breathing.

, The key difference is that during costochondritis the painful area is generally sensitive to the touch and the pain is reproducible when your doctor examines you and palpitates the area.Even so, in all cases of chest pain, it is best to see a doctor immediately to rule out a heart attack.


Like the onset of a heart attack, the pain is often on the left side. It may be sharp and worsen when you take a deep breath, turn your body, or move your arm.
A heart attack is usually a dull pain and is associated with numbness in the arm and jaw.

, Costochondritis has various causes. Some frequent ones are:An injury which damages the cartilage that joins the rib and breastbone. This may include a blow or straining sustained during carrying heavy items or severe coughing. An upper respiratory infection which causes severe coughing can trigger costochondritis.Arthritis in the joint. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis can cause chest pain.
An infection in the joint, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, or aspergillosis. Sometimes costochondritis is caused by a bacterial infection in the joint after surgery.A tumor infecting the joint.
In other cases there may be no clear cause.

Check for an elevated heart rate.All types of shock, including distributive shock, typically present with a faster than normal heart rate (over 100 beats per minute).,
Observe an increased respiratory rate.In addition to an elevated heart rate, all types of shock also typically present with rapid respiration.,
Feel for warm extremities.In distributive shock specifically (which includes septic shock), a person's extremities (hands and feet) will typically be warmer than usual.,
Notice decreased urination.In shock, because the body perceives a lack of effective blood flow and oxygenation, it will seek to conserve fluids.,
Evaluate for a fever.Because infection (""sepsis"") is the number one cause of distributive shock, it is key to test for the presence of a fever.,
Look for signs of confusion.Shock typically presents with confusion, and often with a decreased level of consciousness.,
Measure blood pressure.In shock, the blood pressure is lower than normal.,
Take note of an infection preceding the onset of shock.The number one reason for someone to go into distributive shock is due to an infection that gets worse and spreads to the bloodstream (called ""sepsis"").,
Consider the possibility of anaphylaxis.Another reason for someone to go into distributive shock is due to anaphylaxis - a systemic allergic reaction, which may occur in response to a bee sting or other allergy.,
Assess for other common causes of distributive shock.Other common causes of distributive shock include ""SIRS"" (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), pancreatitis, kidney problems (called ""Addisonian crisis""), burns, toxic shock syndrome (most common in women who are menstruating who have left a tampon in for too long), and ""neurogenic shock"" (a subtype of distributive shock caused by a spinal cord injury that results in decreased blood vessel tone).

,
Test for lactic acidosis.A blood test for lactate can indicate the presence of lactic acidosis.,
Evaluate white blood cell counts.Measuring white blood cells via a blood test is also very helpful in assessing for the presence of an infection, which is the leading cause of distributive shock.,
Assess vital organ function.,
Opt for other diagnostic tests as needed to determine the underlying cause.,
Begin treatment.",How to Spot Distributive Shock Symptoms," You can take someone's pulse, or listen to their heart with a stethoscope, to determine their heart rate.


In distributive shock, when you feel the pulse at the person's extremities (wrists and/or ankles), you are likely to feel a ""bounding pulse.""
A bounding pulse is a stronger, more forceful pulse than normal.
It is due to the increased total blood volume in distributive shock, from the vasodilatory effects that occur in sepsis or anaphylaxis (among other things).
The bounding pulse may be felt early, but as the shock progresses, the pulse will become weak or absent in the extremities.;
, This is because the fundamental problem in shock is lack of oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. Therefore, the body tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by breathing more rapidly.


Greater than 20 breaths per minute is considered an elevated respiratory rate.

, This is because distributive shock, perhaps counter-intuitively, presents with more blood than normal in the circulatory system; however, the blood is ""distributed"" inappropriately throughout the body, leading to inadequate circulation to the vital organs and excess blood flow to the extremities and to areas of the body that do not need it.

, As a result, urine output will decrease, leading to infrequent urination.

, A temperature greater than 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) may be indicative of an infection.


A temperature less than 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit) is also of concern, as sometimes the body can present with a reduced temperature rather than with a fever.

, This is due to the decreased effectiveness of blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body. In more severe cases, the person may even be unconscious.

, It is typically below 90 mm Hg systolic, and it may even be undetectable. In distributive shock, even though more blood than normal is shunted to the extremities (the arms and legs), the blood vessels have dilated and, as such, the blood pressure reading still tends to be low.

, Therefore, if you are trying to recognize distributive shock, ask about and assess for any recent or current infections.


The most common infections that can lead to shock include pneumonias, genitourinary infections, and abdominal infections.

, People often carry an ""epipen"" (epinephrine pen) if they have been diagnosed with allergies that may lead to anaphylaxis and/or distributive shock. Inquire if there was exposure to a triggering allergen before the onset of shock.

,, Lactic acidosis is an indication that the body's vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and oxygen, which, if not resolved, could lead to multi-organ failure.


The degree of lactic acidosis, therefore, is a way to measure the severity of shock symptoms.

, White blood cells can also be elevated in other inflammatory conditions that may underlie distributive shock.


If an infection (""septic shock"") is suspected as the cause of distributive shock, blood cultures can also be taken.
A blood culture can grow the bacteria or other microbe that is causing the infection, allowing doctors to choose an appropriate antibiotic (or other antimicrobial agent, depending upon the cause of the infection) for treatment.

, Because the consequence of shock that is trying to be avoided is vital organ failure, it is key to assess the function of vital organs. Organs to test include:


Kidney function
Liver function
Heart function
Pancreas function, as pancreatitis can actually be a cause of distributive shock

, If distributive shock (or any other form of shock) is suspected or diagnosed clinically, it is key to identify the underlying cause so that it can be resolved. Additional diagnostic tests that may be of use include a chest x-ray and/or a CT scan, among other things.


Further tests will be ordered depending on the suspected etiology, for example, if pneumonia is suspected, a sputum culture and Gram stain may be ordered as well., If shock is confirmed, the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. The underlying cause must be treated as the patient is stabilized with oxygen. Vital signs and fluid intake and outtake should be measure hourly."

Monitor for physical symptoms.,
Consider your risk factors.,
Get an ultrasound.,
Try a D-dimer blood test.,
Have a contrast venography test.",How to Treat DVT1," DVT is often accompanied by pain and/or swelling in one or both legs. Pain usually starts at the calf. Your leg may feel sore or cramped. In addition to the symptoms tied directly to DVT, you should monitor for symptoms of pulmonary embolism, a serious complication resulting from DVT. These symptoms include:Coughing up blood.
Feeling dizzy or lightheaded.
Chest pain.
Shortness of breath.
A racing heartbeat.;
, Anyone can get a DVT, but some people are at a higher risk than others. People at a higher risk of DVT include those who are:Hospitalized or who have recently had surgery.
Immobile.
Elderly.
Overweight or obese.
Have a family history of blood clots.
Have had recent or recurring cancer.
Are pregnant or recently had a baby.
Taking hormonal birth control or hormone replacement medication.
Have recently been injured.

, An ultrasound (or ultrasonography) is an imaging technique that uses sound waves to examine how blood flows through your veins. Ultrasounds are the most common tests used to diagnose DVT. This non-invasive test can provide your doctor with real-time images of the inner workings of your veins and organs, which can help determine the severity of your DVT and provide a potential course of treatment.Your doctor might suggest a related technique, a duplex ultrasonography (or duplex ultrasounds). Duplex ultrasonography is similar to the regular ultrasound, but it monitors movement of blood and other internal objects and fluids. Duplex ultrasounds can provide more accurate information about the speed and flow of blood.Your doctor will help you schedule an appointment with a sonographer in a vascular laboratory if they believe you should get this test, usually at a large hospital with the necessary sonography equipment.
During the test, a technician will simply apply a thin layer of gel to your legs and/or feet, then wave an ultrasound wand over them. You might also need to wear a blood pressure cuff.

, The D-dimer test examines a blood sample for small pieces of clotted blood that may have broken off. If your physician detects a large number of these clot fragments, there’s a greater likelihood that you have DVT., Contrast venography involves getting a dye injected into a large vein in the foot or ankle, then taking an X-ray or series of X-rays over time. The X-rays will reveal how your veins are transmitting the blood throughout the body. If there are any clots, they will appear on the X-rays as areas where the dye is concentrated."
"
Try heparin.,
Take low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs).,
Get warfarin.,
Ask your doctor about other medications.,
Try a clotbuster.,
Look out for any side effects.",How to Treat DVT2," Heparin is an anticoagulant. That is, it is a drug that thins the blood in order to loosen and reduce the clot. To receive heparin, go to your doctor. They will inject heparin directly with a shot, or connect an IV to your vein in order.After getting heparin, you’ll need to be monitored closely. Your doctor will take a blood test (the activated partial thromboplastin time, or a PTT test) each day to ensure you’re getting the correct amount of heparin relative to the results of your blood test.
Heparin itself is inexpensive and fast acting, but you'll need to stay in a hospital for anywhere from three to 10 days with this option depending on your situation, which can make it quite expensive. Heparin is also preferred as a first treatment because it is easy to start and stop if there are complications.

, LMWHs are similar to regular heparins in basically all aspects except two. First, unlike regular heparins, LMWHs are approved for home use. And secondly, you won’t need to be monitored as closely when using LMWHs. This means that using LMWHs can save you a lengthy hospital stay.LMWHs are a bit more expensive than regular heparins, but are more cost-effective in the long term since you will not have to spend time in the hospital or pay for related medical costs.Common LMWHs include dalteparin, enoxaparin, and tinzaparin. The dosage for these medications varies by weight and if it's for treatment or prevention of clot. These are often used before and immediately after surgery to prevent clots, such as for orthopedic surgery.

, Warfarin, like heparins, is an anticoagulant provided by your doctor. Unlike heparins, though, warfarin is a pill, not an injectable. It also acts more slowly than heparins, and won’t generally kick in for five to seven days. Just as with heparins, you’ll need your blood tested regularly (two or three times per week) so that your doctors will be able to determine if the warfarin is working and if the doses need to be corrected.Depending on your condition, you might need to take warfarin for a few days, or for the rest of your life.
Avoid drinking alcohol when taking warfarin. Alcohol can thin the blood too much and increase your odds of excess bleeding in the event of injury.
One of the biggest challenges for people taking heparin is that changes in diet, supplements, or medication can change the drug’s effectiveness and may result in a need to adjust the dosage. Therefore, the best thing to do is to maintain a consistent diet and make sure that any doctors who prescribe medications for you know that you are taking heparin.

, There are some other medications available that you can discuss with your doctor. The newest pill anticoagulants include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran etexilate. These drugs don't have the same monitoring requirements as warfarin, or as many food/drug interactions. However, if you have a bleeding complication, not all of the available medications have a reversal agent., Clotbusters are used for more serious cases of DVT. The most common type of clotbusters are thrombolytics (also known as tissue plasminogen activators, or TPAs). While anticoagulants can prevent future clots, they don’t actually break up existing clots brought on by DVT. TPAs, on other hand, can break up existing clots. However, clotbusters can be dangerous since they might cause serious bleeding. The medications are delivered intravenously by a medical professional., Each treatment method has its own side effects. Side effects of heparin include headaches, rashes, flu-like symptoms, and indigestion. Osteoporosis might occur, especially in pregnant women. LMWHs have the same side effects, though likelihood of osteoporosis is much lower. Side effects of warfarins include rashes, headaches, hair loss, bleeding, and elevated liver enzymes.More serious – but less common – side effects from warfarins include skin necrosis (dying skin tissue), purple toe syndrome (a condition in which your toes might turn blue or purple due to abnormal blood flow), and extreme bleeding. If you have trouble staunching the flow of blood from cuts and scrapes, or experience heavy menstrual bleeding, you should inform your doctor.Immediately report these or any other unusual health developments to your doctor immediately.
Your doctor might reduce your prescription or prescribe another treatment method entirely if you react badly to a given treatment.

Have a filter installed.,
Use a compression stocking.,
Adopt lifestyle changes.",How to Treat DVT3," Filters are an appropriate treatment for DVT when you cannot use blood thinners. The filter itself is a soft mesh device that allows the passage of blood but traps blood clots. The filter is inserted into a large abdominal vein (the vena cava) and prevents clots that might break up from making their way to your lungs.Filter installation sounds extensive but actually occurs while you’re awake. Your doctor will apply a numbing agent on the stomach, then cut through to the vena cava, using an ultrasound to guide a catheter to the precise location. Finally, the filter will be snaked through the catheter and expand to filter the vein.There is no need to have the filter cleaned or attended to. Over time, your body’s own anticoagulants will disintegrate trapped blood clots.Some filters are removable, but most are permanent. Even the removable filters are usually kept in the vein if your likelihood of developing DVT again remains high.Your doctor will help you decide whether you need a permanent or a removable filter.

, Compression stockings are specialized apparel that keep the legs and feet from swelling. Compression stockings can prevent swelling of the legs and feet that is so often a consequence of DVT. They can also reduce the likelihood of future clots by increasing the pressure in your legs.To use compression stockings, simply slip them over your foot and up your leg just as you might with knee-high socks or stockings.
Compression stockings are usually worn during the day for two or three years. If your DVT persists, you might need to wear compression stockings for an even longer time.

, Get regular exercise. Aim for 30-60 minutes of cardio exercise each day. Biking, walking, and running are all examples of cardiovascular exercise that could help you correct or reduce the likelihood of worsening your DVT. Try to take the stairs instead of the elevator. In addition: Get up frequently if you have a desk job. Take a quick walk around the office in order to prevent clots from forming in your legs.
See a doctor regularly. Your doctor will be able to provide specialized recommendations based on your particular medical history and background that could help you prevent and recover from DVT.
Sleep with your legs raised slightly. If you sleep with your feet elevated even a few inches above the level of your hip when lying down, your blood will more easily return from the legs and back to your body. Prop your legs up by placing a pillow beneath your feet.

Try controlled writing.",How to Treat Fibromyalgia with Acupuncture," Studies have shown that acupuncture can relieve the pain of FM although it's difficult to measure its effectiveness.Both manual acupuncture (where needles are inserted into the skin) and electroacupuncture (EA) can relieve pain, fatigue, and sleep issues that are caused by FM.EA uses a very slight electrical charge to stimulate pressure points.


Acupuncture is most effective when used with other treatments for FM. There are very few side effects.;
, Although acupuncture is widely practiced, people with certain conditions shouldn't use acupuncture to treat fibromyalgia. Avoid acupuncture if you're pregnant since it could start labor. You should also avoid electroacupuncture if you have a pacemaker since the electrical pulse can cause problems with your pacemaker. And, don't use acupuncture if you have a bleeding disorder since this could increase bleeding and bruising from the needles.If you're still planning to use acupuncture if you have a bleeding disorder, you should let your acupuncturist know whether or not you're taking blood thinners like warfarin.

, Most acupuncture done by licensed professionals is low risk. But, you may experience mild side effects like bleeding or bruising where the needles were inserted. More serious side effects include organ damage from needles that were inserted too far or infection.Infection is possible if the acupuncturist doesn't use sterile needles or change needles between patients. This makes the spread of Hepatitis possible.

, Many people find that acupuncture relieves pain caused by fibromyalgia, but you may want to try while using other treatments. It's a safe complementary treatment, meaning it won't interfere with any other medications or treatments you're using.


You should feel relief within a few weeks (2 to 3). But, if you don't, acupuncture probably won't treat your fibromyalgia and you should try a different treatment., Choose an acupuncturist who has experience in FM since it is a complicated condition. The acupuncturist should be licensed and have extensive training in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).You can ask questions about the acupuncturist's: experience with FM, training experience, and success rates, as well as how you might expect to feel after the therapy.


Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient form of treatment that includes herbs and mind and body therapies to treat health problems. Studies have shown that TCM is effective in treating FM., Understand that the pressure or energy points used in acupuncture are different from patient to patient, depending on the individual's symptoms. For this reason, it's important to talk with your acupuncturist about what symptoms are troubling you before you have the treatment. This can help your acupuncturist create a treatment plan for you.


According to TCM and acupuncture, FM is considered to be a “ damp” and “cold” syndrome with weakened spleen and/or liver energy. This is just a different interpretation of organ function. It doesn't necessarily mean that your liver is not functioning well.

, Try to be calm before your acupuncture treatment and wear loose clothing to make it easy for the acupuncturist to position the needles. You should also eat wisely before your treatment. Don't be so full that you're uncomfortable, but you shouldn't be so hungry that you're feeling faint. Instead, eat a light snack a few hours before the session.Avoid drinking caffeine or smoking before acupuncture. These can stimulate your body, instead of helping it to rest.

, One common treatment pattern for fibromyalgia treats liver qi (energy) stagnation. The ""four gates"" pattern can relieve the stress and pain that comes from fibromyalgia by improving energy and blood circulation.The ""four gates"" pattern is the right and left side acupuncture points for Liver 3 (Taichong) and Large Intestine 4 (Hegu)., If you you have a sore lower back and restless leg syndrome, your acupuncturist might use a pattern to treat for kidney deficiency. Your acupuncturist may also want to treat qi and blood stagnation and deficiencies that can be causing you pain.


Your acupuncturist will probably use acupuncture point Stomach (ST) 29 to treat these pains. ST 29 is on your lower abdomen, near your navel., Take care of yourself after your acupuncture treatment. Avoid exercising or overexerting yourself, since your body needs rest, even if it's feeling better. If you want, you can apply a hot pad for more pain relief. You should also drink plenty of water to flush toxins out of your body.If you get pain relief from acupuncture, get treatments once or twice a week., Although there's no diagnostic test to determine if you have FM, the American College of Rheumatology lists fatigue, waking unrefreshed, cognitive (memory or thought) problems, and a history of widespread pain that lasts more than 3 months as the basis for diagnosis.Other symptoms can include:Morning stiffness
Headaches
Irritable bowel syndrome
Painful menstrual periods
Numbness or tingling of the extremities
Restless legs syndrome
Temperature sensitivity
Sensitivity to loud noises or bright lights

, Once your doctor has diagnosed FM, you may be put on medication to relieve pain. These medications work by blocking or changing the levels of brain chemical messengers that signal pain. Your doctor may also prescribe medications to relieve sleep problems associated with FM. For some people, antidepressant medications are effective with relieving sleeplessness and pain. Other medications approved for treating FM include:Duloxetine
milnacipran
pregabalin
gabapentin

, Exercise can be very helpful in reducing pain for some people. Unfortunately, if you have FM you might have trouble exercising. But, you should see an improvement after 6 weeks of exercising. Try to exercise at least 2 or 3 times a week.Stick to low-impact aerobic exercises like walking, swimming, biking, or yoga.You may want to work with a physical therapist before increasing your physical activity level. The physical therapist can help you improve your range of motion.

, Work with a therapist trained in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce your stress and anxiety surrounding FM. Your therapist will have you consider how you react to pain, fatigue, and stress. The goal of CBT is to become aware and change your mindset.


Positive distraction is another tactic of CBT. For example, if you're feeling pain, try to distract yourself by doing something you enjoy like watching a movie.For example, you may feel like you're not handling FM well and that you'll never be able to cope with it. With CBT, you can change that negative thought into a coping statement. For example, you could remind yourself that trying new treatments and therapies is coping with FM., Since you never know when your FM will flare up, you should be prepared to deal with pain. It can be helpful to know how to relax yourself, preventing health problems caused by stress. You might want to do guided imagery, where someone plays music and says words or phrases to guide your mind to a relaxed state.


You can also practice controlled breathing. Slowly breath in through your nose and gradually exhale through your open mouth. Repeat this until you feel calm., It can be easy to overdo things on days when you feel well. To avoid getting in the cycle of overacting, feeling pain, and resting start to pace your activities. Instead, you should be following a cycle of activity, rest, activity, rest, and so on.For example, if you have a project you need to do, break it up into several days and alternate with days of rest.

, Stress and pain of FM may make it difficult to sleep, but there are things you can do to improve your sleep. Create a healthy sleep routine by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day. Only use your bed for sleep and sex. You should also create a restful sleep environment (comfortable bed and room temperature).Avoid stimulants (like caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol) before bed. These can make it harder to go to sleep or remain asleep.

, Some studies have shown that writing about your feelings every day (written emotional disclosure), can reduce symptoms of FM (especially stress). Take time to write about your emotional state every day for several months in order to see some relief.


Although the link between controlled writing and improvement in FM has been made, more research is needed to understand it."

Have a culture test performed.",How to Treat Dermal Filler Infections1," You should monitor your skin for any signs of infection after your dermal fillers. Notice any pain or tenderness that is accompanied by warm skin and swelling near the injection site. Check to see if an area looks different than other areas that have been treated. An infected area may also develop abscesses or nodules filled with pus or that are covered with crust.Additionally, infection can be identified by fever and/or redness.
, You should contact the doctor who performed the procedure if you notice any redness, swelling, or tenderness after the day of the injection. The doctor will perform a physical exam, where they check the site of the injection for infection. They will also ask you how long it has been since your injection, because that can help them determine the type of infection.If you can’t go to the doctor who did your injections, visit your regular doctor.

, Your doctor may take a culture from the infected area to determine what type of infection you have and the proper kind of antibiotics to prescribe. The most common type of infection from dermal fillers is bacterial, but you can also have fungal or viral infections."

Watch for outbreak symptoms.",How to Treat Cold Sores in Your Nose," Because it is difficult to see inside of your nose, you may need to figure out if you have cold sore instead of another condition such as an ingrown hair or pimple. Checking the areas in and around your nose can help you figure out if you have cold sores in your nose.


Use a mirror to check the visible surfaces of your nasal cavity. You may not be able to see much, but even detecting a cold sore can help.
Recognize symptoms of cold sores in your nose including tingling and itching, burning, feeling painful bumps, and oozing from small blisters.You may also have a fever or headache.See if there is an inflamed area either on the inside or outside of your nose that might indicate cold sores.
Avoid sticking your fingers or other objects deep inside your nose. Things like cotton swabs can lodge themselves in your nose, which may cause severe harm.
See your doctor or leave the sore alone if you can’t locate the source of the pain.;
, If the cold sores in your nose aren’t too severe, allow them to heal without treatment. In many cases, the sores may heal within one to two weeks without treatment.Use this treatment option only if you feel well and may not come into contact with anyone. Remember that even a cold sore in your nose is contagious to others., Wash any cold sores in your nose when you notice them. Gently cleansing the area may keep the outbreak from spreading and help heal it.Use a washcloth soaked in warm, soapy water if the sores aren’t far inside your nasal cavity. Wash the cloth in a hot soapy cycle before using it again.Heat a glass of water to a comfortable, hot temperature that won’t burn your skin and add some antibacterial soap. Dip a cotton swab in the water and gently place it on cold sore in your nose if it isn’t too deep inside. Repeat the process two to three times per day.

, Ask your doctor for a prescription antiviral medication and take it. This can help treat outbreaks sooner, lessen the severity of recurrences, and minimize the chance of transmitting the virus.Common medications for cold sores are Acyclovir (Zovirax), Famciclovir (Famvir), and Valacyclovir (Valtrex).Follow dosing instructions given by your doctor for maximum efficacy.
Your doctor may advise an antiviral infection if your outbreak is severe., Because the sores are in your nose, this may not be the easiest treatment to apply. Consider using these topical creams if you want to shorten the time of your outbreak, relieve discomfort, or minimize the risk of infecting someone else. Ask your doctor about the best way to apply some of the following creams:


Penciclovir (Denavir)Acyclovir cream (the antiviral treatment in topical form — may be more effective than other topical treatments)'Docosanol 10% (Abreva), which you can purchase over the counter., You may experience itching and irritation with your cold sores. To reduce them, consider applying a gel or cream with lidocaine or benzocaine.Be aware that these remedies may only offer minimal or short-term relief.Buy these treatments at most pharmacies and some grocery stores or large retailers.
Apply these remedies with a clean finger or cotton swab only if the cold sores are not deep inside your nasal cavity.

, Blisters or cold sores associated with the herpes simplex virus can be painful. In addition to topical ointments, there are several ways to minimize the pain and discomfort.Take an over the counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to minimize pain.Apply ice or a cool washcloth to the outside of your nose may also help., Studies have produced mixed results for treating cold sores with alternative therapies.Consider using these treatments if you want to avoid chemicals or in conjunction with a medical treatment, but speak with your doctor first. Some alternative therapies that may work are:


Lysine supplements or creams
Propolis, an ointment also known as synthetic beeswax
Stress reduction through breathing exercises and meditation.A sage or rhubarb cream, or a combined sage-rhubarb cream.Lip balm containing lemon extract for lesions not too deep in your nose., The liquid that oozes from cold sores contains the virus and can infect others.Limiting or avoiding skin-to-skin contact can prevent cold sores from transmitting or making yours worse.


Abstain from oral sex and kissing, even if the blisters are only in your nose.Keep your fingers and hands away from your eyes., Any time you have a cold sore, even if it is in your nose, wash your hands before touching yourself or someone else. This can keep the virus from spreading on your skin or to anyone else.Wash with any type of soap, which can kill bacteria.Lather the soap on your hands for at least 20 seconds.Dry your hands completely with a clean or disposable towel., Whenever you have blisters present, avoid sharing items with other people. This can minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others and to other areas of your skin.Keep a separate set of utensils, towels, and other linens when you have an outbreak.Avoid using lip balms and personal items from other people., Stress, illness, fatigue may make you more prone to having an outbreak of cold sores. Manage stressful situations as much as you are able and make sure you are getting enough rest, especially when you are sick.Organizing your day with a flexible schedule that incorporates time to relax can reduce your stress.Avoid stressful situations if possible.
Take deep breaths or try breathing exercises to help you relax.Get regular exercise, which can also help reduce stress.Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night.Don't push yourself if you feel like you're getting sick. Make sure you get adequate rest and take time off work or school if you need to.

, If you begin seeing the symptoms of an outbreak, treat them promptly. This can reduce the amount of time your outbreak lasts and reduce its severity.If you begin to experience the telltale tingling or itching sensation that is often present before an outbreak, you may wish to begin treatment immediately.


Call your doctor and ask for prescription to minimize and treat your outbreak."

When the blood stops flowing, tissues die, and that's when gangrene can set in. Anything that cuts off circulation needs to be avoided, and this certainly includes smoking.The active ingredient in cigarettes, nicotine, is what greatly affects the blood vessels. It constricts the blood vessels, therefore resulting in less blood flow. If a body part has less blood flow, it will also have less oxygen. The prolonged lack of oxygen in body tissues causes it to become necrotic tissue (dead tissue), which can lead to gangrene formation.
Smoking is also associated with a number of vascular disorders that can cause the narrowing and hardening of blood vessels.
It is advisable to gradually stop smoking rather than suddenly all at once because it can result in intense withdrawal symptoms, which in turn make it difficult to stay committed to quitting.
Ask your doctor to help you quit smoking.;
, With gangrene, tissue and muscle are damaged due to poor blood circulation. Therefore, it is advisable to eat foods high in protein and calories in order to aid in muscle and tissue repair. Protein can also help re-build damaged muscles, while nutrient-rich (rather than the empty calories of junk food) give your body energy to undertake the processes it needs to function.Foods high in protein but low in fat, so as to avoid clogging up your arteries, include turkey, fish, cheese, lean pork, lean beef, tofu, beans, eggs, and peanuts. Avoid fatty foods like red meat, butter, lard, hard cheese, cakes and biscuits, and fried food. Try instead to incorporate more dark, leafy green vegetables into your diet., Germanium is an antioxidant and is believed to increase oxygen function in the body, though much of the evidence at present remains anecdotal. It also enhances the immune system and has anti-cancer properties.Foods high in germanium include garlic, onions, shiitake mushrooms, whole wheat flour, bran, ginseng, green leafy vegetables, and aloe vera.Because of the lack of firm scientific evidence for germanium as a means of circulating oxygen to the tissues when a person has dry gangrene, there are no recommended dosages or amounts to ingest. Talk to your doctor to get his opinion on whether consuming more germanium might be helpful in your particular case.

, Although watching how much sugar you consume is important for everyone, it's especially key for diabetics. People with diabetes should lessen their sugar consumption to keep their levels at the suggested level based on their eating schedule, exercise routine, and time of day. They should also check their extremities for any signs of cuts, redness, swelling or infection on a regular basis.Those with diabetic neuropathy should assess themselves daily for any symptoms of numbness in arms, legs, fingers and toes because these are signs of ineffective blood circulation. High sugar intake correlates with high blood pressure, which adversely affects normal blood flow in the blood vessels.

, Heavy drinking beyond the recommended daily limits can cause a spike in blood pressure as well as increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, which in turn can lead to blockages in blood flow.Women should limit themselves to one drink per day and men to a maximum of two drinks per day. Be aware that a single drink is considered one beer (12 oz), one glass of wine (5 oz) or one mixed drink containing 1.5 oz of liquor., Although the effects of exercise on developing and treating dry gangrene are not exactly known, exercise can alleviate some of the underlying conditions that lead to dry gangrene. For example, one study found that an exercise program of supervised walking on a treadmill for 30 to 40 minutes three to four times a week improved symptoms of claudication, or painful cramping in the legs, due to the leg muscles not getting enough blood flow.Consider undertaking a moderate exercise regime at home, either walking on a treadmill or in your neighborhood as directed above. Keep a walking diary to log your workouts and any symptoms or feelings you may experience. Consult your physician before beginning any exercise regimen if you have any heart or other pre-existing conditions.

, If you cannot move independently, do passive range-of-motion exercises. These exercises require someone to assist you in moving your joints in a full range of motion on a regular basis to prevent muscle contracture (permanent shortening of joints and muscles) and to improve blood supply in a specific body part. These exercises include:


Head exercises, such as head turns, tilts and chin-to-chest movements.
Shoulder and elbow exercises such as elbow bends, up and down, side to side movements.
Forearm and wrist exercises, such as wrist bends, and rotation and up and down movements
Hand and finger exercises, such as finger bends, finger spreads, and finger rotations.
Hip and knee exercises, such as bending the hip and knee, side to side leg movements, and leg rotations.
Ankle and foot exercises, such as ankle bends, rotations, side to side movements, toe bends, and toe spreads.

, Sores or burns must be given attention immediately, especially when they occur on people with diabetes, as these can result in a non-healing wound. Regardless of whether you already have gangrene or are worried about developing it, the most important thing is to keep the wound clean and protected while the body attempts to build a capillary bed underneath the scab, or eschar. Follow these steps:Clean the wound with betadine or peroxide and then apply prescribed antibiotic cream.
After cleaning thoroughly, cover the wound with sterile gauze bandages and with a clean cotton sock. Cotton can remove moisture away from the wound by absorbing it and also promotes air circulation that can aid in healing.

, A cayenne tincture, a liquid extract made of cayenne, will help alleviate the pain, increase the functioning of your circulation system, and reduce your risk of developing infection. You can buy cayenne tincture from any local pharmacy nearest you. Apply it to affected areas for two to three times daily or as advised by your doctor.You could also smash up a few cloves of garlic and apply it directly to the wound. This was a standard treatment during World Wars I and II as garlic has both antimicrobial properties to prevent or treat infection for gangrene and anti-platelet properties that help break up the blood clots that are causing the gangrene.Alternatively, apply a bandage of sliced onions in affected areas. To do this, you can slice one onion and bandage it to the affected area using a clean cloth. Let it stay for five to 10 minutes and do it several times in a day. This will improve circulation on the affected area.Try applying honey to the wound. Honey has long been used on burns, wounds, and ulcers.Research is ongoing, but honey has been shown to have antibacterial properties. Make sure you use a a sterilized, laboratory-tested honey.Spread honey on a dressing or bandage and then apply it to directly the wound. You can also find pads pre-impregnated with honey., Surgical procedures are done if gangrene has progressed severely and the dead tissue needs to be removed. How much dead tissue needs to be removed typically depends on how much blood is reaching the area and where. This is the standard treatment for dry gangrene. The surgical procedures that can help are the following:Skin debridement — This surgical procedure is done by removing the affected tissue rotted by the gangrene. Sometimes the skin is replaced it with other healthy skin tissue (called a skin graft).Amputation — If there is total tissue death and other medical and surgical procedures can no longer save the affected area, the limb or other body part may have to be amputated to prevent gangrene from spreading to nearby areas and other parts of the body. This surgical intervention is done when skin debridement can no longer help. Be aware that in most cases, unless your life is at risk, the decision to amputate will only be made after a full consultation with your doctor where you can get all the information you need to make an informed choice., As an alternative to surgery, maggot therapy is also an option that similarly works to remove dead tissue. In this non-surgical treatment, maggots from fly larvae are placed on top of the gangrene-affected area and then covered with gauze. The maggots feed on the dead tissue and, fortunately, ignore healthy tissue. Maggots are also useful in fighting infection because they release substances that kill bacteria.There is some research suggesting that this treatment with maggots may be more effective than surgical debridement. However, most people are too fearful or hesitant to try this non-surgical alternative because of its ""icky"" nature., This is an alternative treatment wherein you are placed in a special chamber filled with pressurized air. Then, a plastic hood is placed over your head for you to inhale pure oxygen. Although it may sound a bit intimidating, it is an effective therapy that delivers high levels of oxygen into your blood, provides oxygen to the affected areas, and improves blood supply and flow. The blood will reach the gangrene-affected areas even among patients with poor blood supply.When enough oxygen is supplied to affected areas, your risk of amputation is reduced. Research has indeed confirmed hyperbaric oxygen therapy to be effective in treating foot gangrene related to diabetes and in reducing the risk of amputation.
Be sure to discuss whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy would be a good fit for you., The main surgeries to restore blood flow are bypass surgery and angioplasty. Studies have suggested that both surgeries are equally effective in restoring blood flow and decreasing the need to amputate. Angioplasty does, however, have a shorter recovery time, although bypass seems to be more effective in the long-term. Consult your physician about which surgery would be best for your specific condition and medical history.Bypass surgery - In this surgical operation, the surgeon redirects the flow of blood by ""bypassing"" the blockage. The surgeon will connect one of your veins to a healthy part of one of your arteries using a grafting technique.

Angioplasty - An angioplasty involves a tiny balloon being placed into a very narrow or blocked artery. The small balloon is then inflated to widen and open the vessel up. In some cases, the surgeon may also place a metal tube, called a stent, into the artery to keep it open.

, Your doctor may also want to prescribe you anticoagulants in order to reduce blood clotting and thereby improve blood flow. One such anticoagulant is warfarin, which is usually taken orally (2 to 5 mg) once a day (at the same time every day) in tablet form. Warfarin inhibits and interferes with vitamin K, which slows the clotting of the blood. This results in thinning of the blood, making the blood circulation more efficient.


Keep in mind that taking anticoagulants will make you more likely to bleed and that you may not be able to take these medications if you have a history of bleeding problems (such as hemophilia), cancer, kidney or liver disease, heart disease or high blood pressure, among others. Always consult your doctor before taking any medication that affects your blood's ability to flow and clot as normal.

, Antibiotics are typically given to patients whose gangrene is caused by an infection or to those patients for whom the development of an infection is feared due to an open or poorly healing wound. Often, physicians prescribe antibiotics to a patient with dry gangrene post-tissue removal surgery so as to prevent infection of the remaining tissue. Common prescribed medicines include:Penicillin G — This was for a long time the antibiotic drug of choice for gangrene. Typically 10-24 million units per dose (usually every six to eight hours) are given through intravenous (vein access) or intramuscular (muscle access) injection. Penicillin G has bacteriostatic effect which inhibits or prevents the reproduction and growth of the bacteria. Injections are generally preferred for severe infection or for patients having surgery, because they enable larger doses to be administered and reach the affected region more quickly than oral variants. Now, a combination of penicillin and clindamycin, a protein inhibitor, is commonly prescribed.Clindamycin — This drug treats and prevents infection through its bactericidal effect, which kills the bacteria by blocking the protein production process in the bacteria. Without these proteins, the bacteria cannot survive. The usual dose is 300-600 mg orally every six to eight hours or 1.2 grams intravenously twice a day., Surgical wound care is usually provided by your patient program after surgery. It is essentially rehabilitation therapy to regain normal functioning of the affected finger, toe, arm or leg. Part of rehabilitation therapy is performing isotonic exercises in order to maintain function of the affected area.These exercises move the joints together with the muscles in the arms and legs. Isotonic exercise includes:


Brisk or leisure walking
Cycling
Dancing
Skipping

, Dry gangrene may be the result of the following factors:Diabetes — This condition impedes blood flow, especially in the lower extremities, and can lead to a non-healing wound.Vascular problems — Vascular problems, such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), can reduce blood supply in the body. PAD, for example, occurs when the arteries of the heart or body narrow mainly due to atherosclerosis, which hardens the arteries and blood vessels.Vasculitis — Vasculitis refers to a number of autoimmune conditions that cause the blood vessels to become inflamed, such as Raynaud's phenomenon. In this autoimmune disease, the blood vessels chiefly to the fingers and feet temporarily spasm (called a vasospasm), which in turn causes vasoconstriction, or a narrowing of the blood vessels. Triggers for Raynaud's include exposure to the cold and emotional stress.Tobacco addiction — It can cause blockage of arteries and thus impair blood flow.

External injuries — Burns, accidents, wounds and surgeries can damage certain cells in the body which later on slows down blood supply. If the wounds are not treated appropriately and a major blood vessel is damaged or compromised, the vessel can no longer supply adequate blood to the surrounding tissues. This leads to inadequate oxygen supply to the affected body part and, as a result, the tissues surrounding it dies.

Frostbite — Exposure of extremities to very cold temperatures may block usual blood flow. In temperatures of freezing weather frostbite can occur in as little as 15 minutes. Frostbite principally affects the fingers and toes. For prevention, you can wear appropriately lined gloves and shoes to provide warmth and protection from moisture.

Infection — An untreated bacterial infection may consequently take over the affected tissue, resulting in its death and leading to gangrene. This is more common in wet gangrene.

, Gangrene may be classified into different categories, including:Dry gangrene — This type is characterized by dry and withered skin with a brown to purplish-blue to black color. It usually grows slowly and the tissue eventually sloughs off. Dry gangrene can lead to wet gangrene if it becomes infected.

Wet gangrene — Common features of wet gangrene include swelling, blistering and a wet look in the affected tissue due to the release of discharge. Wet gangrene develops after an infection in the affected tissues. This type of gangrene needs urgent treatment because it multiplies quickly and can be very harmful.

Gas gangrene — This type of gangrene is a subtype of wet gangrene. In this condition, the surface of the skin of an affected individual primarily appears normal, but as the condition advances, it may turn pale, then gray to a purplish-red color. A bubbly appearance to the skin may also become noticeable and a crackling sound may be audible when the affected area is pressed. This is due to an infection by a gas producing organism, Clostridium perfringens, which causes tissue death via gas.

Noma gangrene — This condition is a rapidly progressive form of gangrene that primarily affects the mouth and face. This type of gangrene develops mainly in malnourished children living in poor hygienic conditions.

Internal gangrene — This occurs when blood flow to internal organs such as the intestines, gallbladder or appendix are clogged. It often results in fever and sharp, rigorous pain. If left untreated, this can be lethal.

Fournier’s gangrene — This is very uncommon since it involves the genital organs and the urinary tract. It is more common in men than in women.

Progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene or Meleney’s gangrene — This is a rare gangrene type that occurs after an operation and is accompanied by painful skin lesions that break out after one to two weeks following surgery. The pain is sharp and itching.

, Dry gangrene is a serious condition that needs immediate and effective treatment. Any individual experiencing any of the following symptoms must see a doctor urgently to avoid further complications:Numbness and coldness in the affected area and a shriveled appearance to skin
Claudication, or cramping (such as in the legs while walking)
""Pins and needles"" sensation, a stinging, tingling or itching pain
Discoloration of the affected area (the area may be red, pale, purple, and progress to black if not treated)
Dryness of the affected area
Pain
Septic shock (low blood pressure, possible fever, confusion, lightheadedness, shortness of breath). Septic shock is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. This is rare with dry gangrene, but could happen if not treated appropriately.

, This is not a condition to wait out. If you don't seek treatment as soon as possible, you could be facing eventual amputation of the affected body part or limb. Visit your doctor immediately to begin alleviating the issue.


Note that some people may not experience any pain accompanying their dry gangrene and thus do not consult their physicians until the extremity has already turned black. Be vigilant and notify your doctor the second you notice any of the above. Don't wait for the situation to become aggravated.
While home remedies are all well and good, they will likely be insufficient to effectively treat the dry gangrene. Start treatment sooner rather than later to see your symptoms fade much more quickly.

Take oral antibiotics.,
Take hyaluronidase.,
Inject the area with antibiotics.,
Remove build up in the infected area.,
Take antibiotics before the procedure.,
Avoid getting dermal filler injections if you have skin conditions.",How to Treat Dermal Filler Infections2," If you have a dermal filler infection right after your procedure, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics that are commonly used to treat dermal filler infections also contain anti-inflammatory properties. They may be prescribed for up to six weeks., This medication is commonly prescribed alongside antibiotics. Hyaluronidase helps to dissolve the hyaluronic acid fillers from the injection that may be clogged or inside the infected area.Some people are allergic to hyaluronidase, so you may have to test it on your arm first.

, For more serious infections, the doctor may decide to inject the infected areas with antibiotics. This may be given up to three times. There should be one week between the first and second injections, then there will be two weeks between the second and third injection., Your doctor may decide that you need to have the filler they injected into your face or any infected pus removed. This will help clear your pores of debris so they can heal. This procedure will be performed in the doctor’s office., One way that you can avoid infections is to start treating potential infections before you get the dermal filler injections. If you start taking antibiotics prior to the procedure, it could help prevent any infections occurring afterwards.Talk to your doctor about trying preventative antibiotic therapy before your injections.

, Certain conditions may put you at a greater risk for infection after a dermal filler injection. You shouldn’t get them if you already have an infection around your face, including pimples or rashes. People who have dermatitis should also not receive dermal fillers. If you have infections in the nose or mouth, like sinusitis, periodontal disease, throat infections, or abscessed teeth, you should not get this procedure.For example, people with the herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, impetigo, mollusca contagiosa, or yeast infections near the injection site shouldn’t get them.

Keep the area clean.,
Apply ointment.,
Cover the area with gauze.",How to Treat Dermal Filler Infections3," If the infection leads to open wounds on your face, you should treat it like it is a wound. To help prevent more bacteria from entering the wound, wash the area with warm water each day. This helps keep dirt and debris from accumulating in the wound and promote healing.If your doctor says it is okay, use a mild cleanser or antibacterial soap. Discuss what would be best to treat the infected area before using it.

, To help keep the wound moist, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly on it. Doing this helps promote healing, reduce scabbing, and reduce scarring. You can apply the petroleum jelly with clean fingers or a cotton swab., If your wound is large enough and still has open sections, you may want to cover it with gauze. Place gauze over the open area and tape it in place with paper tape. After it has started to heal, you can leave it uncovered.Talk to your doctor about whether or not you should cover the area with gauze.

Limit your sodium intake.,
Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet.,
Begin a regular exercise program and sleep too.,
Avoid non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Get help on chores and routine.,
Seek a support group.",How to Treat Cirrhosis1," Stop the causes of the liver damage by treating the causes. Still, the liver is one of the most regenerative/self-healing organs in the body if you can give it a large portion of a good liver to work on and time to regenerate.The technique in use since the 1990s, requires a healthy living donor who gives a portion of the healthy liver to the patient whose diseased liver is removed, and both persons will be out of the hospital in about a week. The donor recovers in 2 or 3 months (the recipient may take up to a 6 to 12 months to fully heal and adapt). Both livers can grow back to a normal size in 2 months per the USC San Francisco Medical Center; see more info under the section: ""Treating Cirrhosis Medically"", below.,

Quit drinking alcohol. Whether or not your cirrhosis was caused by alcohol abuse, you should stop consuming any alcohol immediately, as it forces your liver to work very hard, and can cause additional damage and scarring.Moderate consumption of coffee has been shown to be helpful in slowing the progression of cirrhosis; therefore, you should consume coffee in moderation (e.g. no more than one to two cups daily)., In order to prevent edema (swelling) or ascites (fluid build-up between organs in the abdomen) from forming, choose foods that are sodium-free, or that are very low in sodium.Avoid high sodium intake which causes or exacerbates fluid retention, which can cause your damaged liver to work harder than necessary.


If you have been consuming a lot of sodium, food may taste very bland to you at first; however, you can choose to garnish your meals with healthy herbs and spices, such as onion powder, garlic, sage, paprika, and pepper., This diet should include moderate amounts of fresh fruits and lots of vegetables. Limit your consumption of animal protein, but be sure to get your protein from other sources such as egg whites, wild caught cold-water fish (such as salmon and flounder), legumes/beans/peas, quinoa, and tofu.Limit your protein intake to lean protein. Eat vegetable protein and lean meat such as broiled/roasted poultry or fish. You need adequate protein in your diet to be well nourished. Stop eating red meat, raw seafood or any large amounts of protein at one time, particularly if you are at risk of encephalopathy, as animal protein can increase the likelihood of developing problems with your mental functioning.Make sure to also eat complex carbohydrates. When the liver is damaged, it cannot accumulate reserves of glycogen for quick energy, so doctors recommend that patients eat vegetable based, carb-rich snacks, fruits, low-calorie snacks (not greasy or sugary ones) between meals.Glycogen is converted into glucose/energy in muscle cells, and the liver converts glycogen to glucose/energy for use throughout the body as it circulates throughout, including the central nervous system.

Fatigue: A drug that has shown promise in fighting fatigue in studies is modafinil ('Provigil', 'Alertec', 'Vigicer', 'Modalert', etc). It is a memory-improving and mood-brightening psycho-stimulant. It enhances wakefulness, attention and vigilance, but its pharmacological profile is notably different from the amphetamines or methylphenidate (Ritalin), as modafinil is less likely to cause jitteriness or anxiety.Excellent snacks that will help boost your carbohydrate/energy intake include crackers, non-sugary cereals (for example regular Cheerios cereal/toasted oat loops have zero/0 sugar), bagels, plain boiled/steamed or baked potatoes without bacon and butter, also plain sweet potatoes are good, as are bananas, and other fruit, low-fat milk, and low-fat no-sugar-added ice cream/frozen yogurt, limit/avoid sugary fruit juices, but eat fresh fruit. Avoid white flour and white bread, but eat whole-multi-grain bread instead.

, Get enough sleep and rest to recover from exercise. Patients with cirrhosis must exercise moderately and regularly to avoid the wasting of muscle tissue, which can occur when the liver becomes damaged. Exercise is also important if you are overweight to lose more fat and less muscle. Try to exercise moderately four times a week for at least 30 minutes a day.


Great forms of exercise include brisk walking, cycling, treadmill, swimming, and machines such as recumbent bike, and a seated stepper that works the arms.

, Stop use of drugs such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen (such as Motrin or Advil), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin which are drugs used to treat mild or moderate pain and inflammation -- but stop using them with your cirrhosis.While they are great for normal/healthy persons for treating the occasional headache, for cirrhosis the normal or larger doses, especially in combination with alcohol, can be toxic to the liver. Cirrhosis means that your liver is already damaged, so you should avoid NSAIDs as they can cause your liver to fail.Ask your doctor first before taking any NSAID medications (that you might think you need) such as Tylenol (acetaminophen, such as Motrin or Advil), aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (Aleve) and any other pain medications. If you are not certain that a medication is safe for you to take, make a quick call to your doctor to make sure is warranted. Failing to do so could be deadly, so it is better to be safe.

, Take friends and family up on their offers of any help and let them know what would be needed. Cirrhosis can be exhausting, so if someone agrees to do grocery shopping, wash a load of laundry or cook your dinner certain days per week accept their help., Strong relationships can help you have a positive attitude. If friends or family don't understand your illness, you may find a support group can be helpful. Ask doctors, nurses, hospitals about support/rehab, etc."
"
Understand that you are more susceptible to infection.,
Deal with infections by protecting yourself.,
Ask your doctor about a multivitamin that is suitable for your needs, as these can help get micro-nutrients that can provide support to your immune system.,
Avoid crowds/crowded areas.,
Get your immunizations.",How to Treat Cirrhosis2," If you have cirrhosis of the liver, your immune system is compromised. Thus, you are more open to bacterial and viral germs, and the infections caused by this vulnerability can be more harmful to you than to others. Chronic inflammation of the bile ducts throughout your liver can lead to tissue scarring (cirrhosis), liver cell death and, eventually, loss of liver function. If scarring of the bile ducts slows or stops the flow of bile out of the liver, you may experience frequent infections in the bile ducts. Then infection risk is high after you've had a surgical procedure to expand a badly scarred bile duct or remove a gallstone blocking a bile duct., With a suppressed immune system, you should take steps to protect yourself from infections.



Wash your hands regularly. Washing your hands is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs (virus or bacteria).You can do this effectively by using clean, running water and soap, lathering for at least 20 seconds, and rinsing well., Your doctor may recommend added supplements of vitamins A, D, E and K to counter suspected vitamin deficiencies. Talk to your doctor before taking herbs or nutritional supplements., If you are in an area that is very crowded, you are more likely to come into close contact (hands, sudden hugs, doorknobs/handles, sneezes, cough) with someone who is ill or carrying germs/virus or bacteria. If you must be in a crowded area, avoid physical contact, and do not touch your face, eyes, or mouth until you wash your hands. Wash them frequently.

Stay away from people who are sick. If you have a colleague, friend, or family member who is sick, avoid them so you are not exposed to viruses or bacteria from coughs or sneezes. If you can't avoid them, then stay back and wear a medical mask if possible.

, Patients who are suffering from cirrhosis should be immunized against hepatitis A and B. The vaccine is made of deactivated hepatitis A and B viruses, which cause the immune system to manufacture antibodies against the hepatitis A and B virus.


There is a combination of a vaccine for both hepatitis A and B called Twinrix.Currently, no vaccines against Hepatitis C exist."
"
Talk to your doctor.,
Take medication to relieve different symptoms of early stage cirrhosis.,
Monitor fluid levels.,
Take medications to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.If your cirrhosis is progressed, your doctor may prescribe medication which will help prevent toxins from building up in your blood.,
Have periodic blood tests performed.To monitor the health of your liver, and to check for markers of developing liver cancer but that may require a liver biopsy, your doctor will likely recommend that you have your blood tested periodically.,
Have a liver transplant, but the supply is low and demand is high.In very severe cases, the only treatment option may be having a liver transplant.,
Regenerate.,
Realize that living donors can be adult-to-adult or adult-to-child.",How to Treat Cirrhosis3," If you have cirrhosis, you need to treat it. However, before taking any medications first consult your doctor.


The medication your doctor prescribes will depend on the specific cause of the liver damage.







, If cirrhosis is caught in the early stage, treat the cause(s) to stop the cirrhosis from worsening. Once the causes are cleared up, the cirrhosis will go away.Diuretics such as spironolactone and torsemide are often prescribed to treat fluid buildup/ascites caused by the cirrhotic liver.
Vitamin K is also given to address bleeding concerns caused by anticoagulant secretions from the liver.

, Your doctor may also order ultrasounds down in the esophagus to check for varices/esophageal varicose veins of the esophagus that indicate blood is ""backed-up ('stalled') by poor circulation through the liver. They can use CT scans to confirm any suspicions of scarring or tumors in the liver.If you develop problems with fluid build-up caused by edema/ascites, your doctor may want to drain the fluid in order to relieve pressure.This is typically done by inserting a needle into the abdomen to release the fluid. The process is known as paracentesis. This is quite simple and may be performed non-sedated, but under local pain reliever by your nephrologist at the office or at a hospital outpatient department., Normally, your liver would do this, but if it is too damaged, it may not be able to filter enough toxins.

, The following blood tests are used to check how well the liver is functioning, and to detect inflammation in the liver:


A test to measure levels of Albumin and total serum protein. Cirrhosis can lead to a decrease in the level of protein in the blood, known as Albumin.A partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time/INR. The point of this test is to determine the blood-clotting factors being produced by the liver.A Bilirubin test. Bilirubin is produced when the liver breaks down hemoglobin, which is what carries oxygen through the blood. Cirrhosis can often lead to high bilirubin levels, which causes jaundice.
Ammonium levels may be tested to check for the potential of hepatic encephalopathy, or the loss of brain function that may occur when your liver is unable to remove toxins.This is a serious condition and, if suspected, the person must be admitted to a hospital immediately.If there is an increased level of enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood, it may mean that the liver is injured and that liver cells are dying.If there is an excess of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). It may be an indication that bile ducts in the liver are blocked.If there is an increase in the level of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), it may mean that the bile ducts are diseased., However, in order to be eligible for a transplant, you will need extensive testing (such as your MELD score) to ensure that you are otherwise healthy enough to receive a transplant, and that you are able and willing to abstain from activities, such as alcohol consumption, to prevent damage to the liver.

, In a living-donor transplant, about half of a donor's liver is removed and used to replace a patient's diseased liver. The liver manages to restore any lost mass and adjust its size to that of the original liver, while at the same time providing support for bodily systems during the entire regenerative process. In situations when hepatocytes or biliary cells are blocked from regeneration, these cell types have the power to function as stem cells for each other.After surgery, the donor's liver regenerates back to full size, while the patient's new liver also grows to a normal size. As the safety of living donors is paramount to the success of this program, Mayo Clinic researchers have conducted a long-term assessment of donor outcomes, such as liver regeneration and mental and physical well-being of both parties. The study's results were very reassuring, as they showed that Mayo living liver donors do very well after donation., Here is some information from USC San Francisco Medical Center: A living donor can be a non-blood-relative, but must have a compatible blood type
During surgery about 40 percent to 60 percent of the donor's liver is transplanted.
The average hospital stay for both recipient and donor is seven days.
Recovery time for donors is about two months and for recipients is about six to 12 months
The liver begins to regenerate itself almost immediately
Within eight weeks, both the donor's and the recipient's livers will be almost completely regenerated to normal size
Donors should be:

18 to 60 years of age
In good health with no major medical or psychiatric illnesses
A non-smoker for at least six weeks prior to surgery
Able to understand and comply with instructions for surgery preparation and recovery

Not pregnant and not overweight, but overweight candidates who lose weight could be considered

Watch for and treat the causes and symptoms of the complications of cirrhosis, and ask your doctors how you may avoid these where possible:High blood pressure in the vein that supplies the liver blood to process (called portal hypertension).",How to Treat Cirrhosis4," The liver receives all exiting circulation (veins) from the small and most of the large intestine, as well as spleen and pancreas, merged in the portal vein.Cirrhotic scarring, swelling, and hardening of the liver interferes with the flow of blood from the vein through the liver, raising pressure. This can overexpand the smaller veins that carry the blood from the intestines, pancreas and the spleen to the liver.

If you're diagnosed bleeding due to pressure requires immediate surgery to relieve pressure on the small veins before they burst

Portal hypertension treatment options may include a beta blocker, or nitrate.

Swelling in the legs and abdomen. Portal hypertension can cause fluid to swell the legs (edema) and accumulate in the abdomen (called ascites). Edema and ascites also may result if the liver cannot make enough blood proteins, especially albumin.

Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). Portal hypertension can interfere with the functioning of the spleen.

Decreased white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT). Blood counts can find these signs of portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. This decreased WBC weakens resistance to infections, and lower PLTs makes bleeding harder to staunch.

Life threatening bleeding. Portal hypertension cause blood to flow/backup into smaller veins in the area of the liver. So this increases their size, becoming varices (varicose veins) in the abdomen, straining the smaller veins may burst and cause hemorrhaging/serious bleeding. This occurs when veins in the lower esophagus (esophageal varices) and/or stomach (gastric varices) rupture and may not be detected soon enough to save the person's health/life. If the liver is not making enough clotting factors, this can also contribute to such deadly bleeding.



Deadly infections. Your body can have difficulty fighting infections. Bacterial infections are then a frequent trigger for bleeding. Ascites (excessive fluids in the abdominal cavity) may lead to bacterial peritonitis, a very serious infection. Tests such as lab-culturing can be performed on the ascites to see if any bacteria grow-in cultures seeded with the fluid.

Malnutrition and Wasting. Cirrhosis makes the liver fall behind and mostly fail in processing venous blood, filtering out enough toxins and in converting glycogen to sugar and vice-versa, and itself not able to use essential nutrients, leading to weakness and weight loss. Eat small meals and snacks -- all moderately sized, balanced, healthy, low-fat, low-sugar, not too much at once.

Toxins endanger the brain, especially ammonia. A liver damaged by cirrhosis isn't able to clear enough toxins from the blood. These toxins can progressively affect the brain and cause mental confusion and difficulty concentrating. Hepatic encephalopathy symptoms may range:

FROM: Fatigue, mild to severe intellectual impairment of cognition, personality changes, impaired memory
TO: Loss of responsiveness while apparently awake -- or periods of unconsciousness and to coma and death.


Jaundice. Jaundice occurs when the diseased liver doesn't remove enough bilirubin, a blood waste product, from your blood. Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes and darkening of urine.
Weak bones/osteoporosis. Some people with cirrhosis lose bone strength and are at greater risk of fractures. Treatment for bone loss associated with primary biliary cirrhosis often involves calcium and vitamin D supplements -- and exercising moderately 4 days of the week to help increase your bone density.Increased risk of liver cancer. A large proportion of people who develop liver cancer which originates in the liver (not from another cancer spreading) have cirrhosis.
Multi-organ failure can occur. Some people experience the failure of several organs in acute-or-chronic liver failure. It is a complication of cirrhosis in some people. Avoiding it and its causes are not well understand.

Have a throat swab to diagnose the specific cause of your sore throat.The vast majority of sore throats (cases of pharyngitis) are viral.,
Take antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis.Once the cause or your sore throat has been confirmed (and assuming that it is indeed bacterial), you will most likely be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics.,
Use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) to ease pain and fever.In addition to taking antibiotics to treat the cause of the infection, you may wish to take Acetaminophen to ease other symptoms.,
Be aware of the expected recovery time.Your bacterial pharyngitis symptoms should begin to improve one to two days after beginning antibiotic treatment.,
Drink plenty of fluids.When you are sick, your body loses more fluids than it normally does as it works to fight off the infection.,
Get plenty of rest.As with any infection, it helps to get as much rest (and sleep) as possible, because this boosts your immune system and helps to fight off the bug faster.,
Try sucking on lozenges.Sucking on lozenges can soothe the pain of a sore throat.,
Gargle warm salt water.Mix half a teaspoon of salt in one cup of water.,
Use a humidifier.A humidifier adds moisture to the air and can help to soothe a sore throat.,
Stay away from others for the duration of your illness.Bacterial pharyngitis can be transmitted through droplets in the air or by touching surfaces that have also been touched by an infected person.,
Wash your hands.Washing your hands frequently (and thoroughly) will also help to prevent others from catching it.,
Clean shared surfaces and avoid sharing whenever possible.Finally, to prevent transmission of your bacterial pharyngitis to others, refrain from sharing objects whenever possible.",How to Treat Bacterial Pharyngitis," However, some are indeed bacterial (called ""bacterial pharyngitis""). The first step when it comes to treating your sore throat is determining the cause, and this cannot be done based on symptoms alone. You will also need to receive a throat swab from your doctor.


A throat swab can identify the presence of bacteria.
It can also inform your doctor of what bacteria specifically is present, causing your sore throat.
Throat culture has fallen out of favor due to delay in diagnosis, and rapid antigen detection tests have become popular. Rapid antigen detection tests also know as “rapid strep test” is favorable because they are quick and have up to 90% sensitivity.;
, The antibiotics will be tailored to the specific bacteria. For a Group A Strep infection, the most common treatment is Penicillin, although there are other choices of antibiotics that may be effective as well.


It is key that you complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed to you by your doctor.
One of the main reasons to take antibiotics in bacterial pharyngitis is to prevent complications from the illness.
Other medication that can be used in the treatment of strep throat other than penicillin include amoxicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin. cephalosporins, and macrolides. For patients with hypersensitivity to penicillins, use cephalsporins for treatment.

, It can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. The usual dosage is 500mg every 4-6 hours as needed.


Acetaminophen can ease the pain of a sore throat by blocking pain receptors in the brain.
Acetaminophen can also reduce fever.

, If you do not notice an improvement, or if new or worse symptoms begin to appear, book a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Most people recover completely from bacterial pharyngitis within a week.


Bacterial pharyngitis that goes untreated poses the risk of complications, such as kidney problems and rheumatic fever.Therefore, it is key to have your infection promptly treated with antibiotics.
Treatment is usually for 10 days; however, response to therapy usually take on a few days of time. Make sure you take the antibiotic as prescribed, and do not stop treatment early.

, Therefore, it is key that you drink plenty of water and stay well hydrated. At least 8 cups, or 64 ounces, of water per day is recommended.


You can also consume other beverages such as hot tea, or fruit juices.
Hot water with a mixture of cinnamon, honey, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar has been shown to be helpful in soothing a sore throat.

, In addition to speeding your recovery, adequate rest can decrease your chance of complications following bacterial pharyngitis.


Take time off work while you recover, and cancel any social commitments you may have.
Staying away from others (i.e. not going into work, or canceling social engagements) also prevents others from catching bacterial pharyngitis. Never go into work sick. You will only make other more at risk and susceptible to contracting your illness.

, Some lozenges actually have numbing anesthetic properties, further helping to ease a sore throat. Lozenges can be purchased at most grocery stores, or at your local pharmacy or drugstore.

, Gargle the solution for several seconds in your mouth, and then spit it out. It is not meant to be swallowed. Repeat this process as much as needed to ease your sore throat.

, The hot steam from taking a shower may also help. You may wish to put a humidifier in your bedroom when you fall asleep at night.

, Therefore, if you have bacterial pharyngitis, the best way to prevent others from catching it is to stay away from others as much as possible.


Take time off work if you are allowed sick days.
Cancel social commitments with others to avoid spreading your illness.

, Wash for at least 30 seconds with soap and warm water. Another option is to carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you for use throughout the day.

, Also clean any shared surfaces, such as doorknobs, kitchen appliances, TV remotes, and phones, after use.

Take herbs and supplements.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome," Together, you should create an individualized program that works for you. Dealing with general practitioners can be difficult if they are not intimately familiar with CFS. CFS has a low diagnosis rate,but approximately 1 in 250 people are afflicted with it.Doctors without a thorough understanding of CFS may misdiagnose it as depression, general anxiety disorder, or a psychosomatic illness. Even where diagnosis is accurate, appropriate treatment may not follow unless the doctor has prior experience and knowledge of CFS.


Work with your doctor to eliminate the possibility any other conditions that may have similar symptoms as CFS, such as thyroid issues.
Your CFS treatment should engage a variety of therapists, counselors, and specialists in specific fields. Some of the symptoms that may require special attention include:

A decrease of energy or enthusiasm that interferes with normal daily activities
Loss of livelihood, independence, and economic security
Feelings of anxiety, anger, or guilt
Memory and concentration problems
Difficulties with intimacy and sexual relationships


Always discuss new and alternative therapies with your health care provider. Many so-called ""quick cure"" therapies may do more harm than good.;
, CBT has proven especially helpful in treating CFS.The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to help you better cope with CFS. By talking through the experience, giving it meaning, and discovering what may have triggered your CFS, you may be able to mitigate or better manage your CFS symptoms.It may be helpful to keep a diary to record your thoughts and experiences during the week before you go in to your CBT session. This way you can refer back to specific examples or situations in which you suffered a period of exhaustion, or in which you demonstrated greater acceptance of your CFS., Like CBT, group therapy offers the opportunity to share your experience with someone who cares. The difference is that you can listen to and learn from the experiences of others who are also suffering from CFS. This will help normalize the experience, and provide insight into other ways to deal with the illness. Group therapy can provide an individual with a sense of belonging and community., Many individuals are unaware of CFS or confused about its causes and symptoms. Open up to your friends and family about your condition. They can be an important source of support. Be patient but firm when you explain both what you’re going through personally and what the medical community has concluded as a whole.


One of the many myths about CFS is that it is psychosomatic, or an imagined disease caused by an individual’s state of mind. Many people believe that individuals with CFS can simply “snap out of it” or can cure themselves by simply adjusting their attitude.Be on the lookout for this insidious myth, and let its adherents know that CFS is a serious condition with a firm basis in medical science.

, A common characteristic of CFS is an inability to concentrate on verbal, written, or visual information. Following directions, multitasking, or performing an action which requires a series of steps may become difficult or impossible.You can try either behavioral or medicinal treatments to rebuild your concentration levels.


Behavioral concentration exercises encourage playing word puzzles or games. Crosswords, Scrabble, or similar games can make the process more fun. Getting an adequate amount of deep, restful sleep can help you focus.

, There are many over-the-counter and prescription medications available which can reduce pain, cognitive problems, and other CFS symptoms.Always use medication as directed and talk to your doctor if you experience any adverse side effects.


Antidepressants have shown some promise in alleviating CFS. These medications can reduce pain and improve quality of sleep in addition to treating the depression that often accompanies CFS.Klonopin, a prescription drug, can help concentration and remove the veil of “brain fog” often experienced by those with CFS.Ask your doctor if Klonopin or other tranquilizers might be helpful for you.
Stimulants, like the drugs used to treat ADHD, may improve concentration in individuals experiencing CFS since the symptoms often overlap.Sleeping pills are frequently used as a CFS medication, since individuals suffering CFS find it difficult to sleep and feel less refreshed by sleep than they did before the onset of CFS.Medication might be part of your CFS treatment, but should not be the only part. Try alternative treatments in addition to medication.

, Pain can be the most debilitating aspect of CFS. Whether you experience headaches, sensitivity to being touched, or aches in your muscles and joints, treating your pain should be a top priority in any CFS treatment regimen.


Readily available pain medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen can help manage your pain.
Therapeutic massage can improve circulation and reduce pain.Deep breathing exercises can help block out pain. By breathing in a deliberate, focused way over a long period, pain and other phenomena can be reduced. In a seated position you’re your eyes closed and both feet on the floor, try breathing in deeply, holding the breath, then exhaling slowly for thirty breaths.
Heat treatments include hot water bottles, hot packs, warm baths, or heated mattress pads. These can help relax muscles and ease pain.Cold treatments include applying ice packs or bags of frozen vegetables to areas causing pain. Do not apply cold treatments for more than 15–20 minutes to a single location.Some chiropractors suggest that spinal manipulation can improve energy levels and reduce pain.Acupuncture may also have benefits depending on the severity of pain., Aim for at least thirty minutes of light exercise each day. Swimming, bike-riding, or walking are all good options.You can also try:


Muscle relaxation techniques and deep breathing
Stretching exercises
Yoga
Tai-chi
Do not overexert yourself when exercising, but make sure your workout is vigorous enough that you gain the healthful benefits.

, A diet rich in fiber, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables may reduce CFS symptoms. Avoid refined foods, and foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat.Aim to eat five or more portions of fruits and vegetables each day.
Modest portions of meat, soy, fish, or another source of protein should be included in two of the three daily meals.
Incorporate starchy foods with a low glycemic index into your meals. These may include bread, cereal, potatoes, and rice.
Try to eat several small portions more often in addition to the traditional three meals each day. Many CFS patients find a snack every three to four hours helps food cravings and improves energy.
Take care not to overeat. CFS patients often believe they can boost their energy levels by consuming more at mealtime. Additionally, many medications prescribed for CFS require they be taken with food. These conditions can easily result in gaining excess weight.Drink water with every meal. Try to drink at least eight glasses each day.
Limit your intake of caffeinated beverages. Caffeine is a stimulant which can disrupt biological rhythms and prevent a full night’s sleep. Soda and coffee should be avoided.
Alcohol depresses the body’s immune system and adds an unnecessary processing load to the liver. In CFS patients, their immune systems and liver are already operating at less than optimal performance. Alcohol can push the already compromised CFS body to the breaking point, with toxic alcohol spilling into the bloodstream and even more dramatically depressed levels of energy.

, Do only your most pressing errands, or those which you have energy for. By pacing your daily schedule, you can intersperse periods of exertion with periods of rest, and avoid sudden physical or mental collapse.


When you feel worn out or near exhaustion, set aside your unfinished tasks and work on them another day.
Schedule periods of downtime and rest for yourself as needed.
After working for a week or so with a regular schedule, decide if you feel capable of adding additional tasks to your daily routine. Re-evaluate your energy level and schedule each week.
Maintain a record of your energy expenditures throughout the day. Staying alert to changes in your energy level will not only help you pace yourself, but can also help you build a sense of accomplishment and chart your recovery in your fight against CFS.
Take “energy shortcuts” where possible. Instead of washing the dishes by hand, run them through the dishwasher. Ride a bike instead of walking to your destination.
Divide large tasks into manageable portions. Instead of taking on the task of cleaning the house, for example, try to clean the kitchen today, the living room tomorrow, and the bedroom the day after next., There are a number of herbs and supplements which may limit CFS.Speak with your doctor before trying supplements, as they can interact with other medications you may be taking. The supplement industry is unregulated, meaning there is no guarantee that you are getting what is advertised on the bottle, so ask your doctor or pharmacist for recommendations for reputable brands.


Magnesium can be used to boost energy, but incorporate it slowly into your vitamin regimen; it has been known to cause diarrhea.
Omega-3 fatty acids are found in nuts, seeds, and fish, and can reduce fatigue.
NADH is a naturally occurring chemical which boosts energy. An NADH supplement can have the same energy-boosting effect when taken orally.
DHEA is a hormone which aids the production of estrogen and testosterone, regulates adrenal gland levels, and helps the body deal with stress. Individuals with CFS tend to have low levels of DHEA (or DHEA sulfate), which leads to fatigue, brain fog, and low blood pressure.Medicinal DHEA supplements can correct low DHEA levels in cases of CFS. You will need a doctor’s prescription to obtain DHEA.Melatonin is a hormone which regulates sleep. When the body prepares for sleep, serotonin levels decline and melatonin levels increase. In CFS patients, melatonin production is disrupted, but can be corrected with a melatonin prescription., Sleep deprivation and general exhaustion are the hallmarks of CFS. Getting enough – but not too much – sleep is an important starting point for recovery.Aim for 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.
Do not consume caffeinated food or drink within three hours of your bedtime.
Make sure your bed is comfortable and spacious enough for you.
Set a regular sleeping schedule. Wake and go to bed at the same time each day.
Try sleeping pills if you continue to struggle getting a full, restful night of sleep.

Determine the stage (severity) of your cancer.The stages of cervical cancer are a progression from Stage 0 to Stage IV (four).,
Treat stage 0 cancer with excision.,
Ask your doctor whether you will need further treatment.If your cancer is very large or has already spread, you will definitely need to proceed to treatment options for later-stage cervical cancer; however, if your cancer is caught when it appears to be small and still localized to the cervix, the excision (removal) may be sufficient.,
Opt for surgery.One highly successful way to treat cervical cancer is to opt for surgery.",How to Treat Cervical Cancer1," Classification depends on three factors: the extent of the main tumor, if the cancer has spread to surrounding lymph nodes, and whether the cancer as spread to distant parts of your body.Your doctor will evaluate the stage of your cancer, and will present you with treatment options based upon that.

Stage 0 — Cancer cells are found on the surface of the cervix but have not grown into the tissue. This stage is also called carcinoma in situ (CIS).Stage I — Cancer cells have invaded the cervix, but cancer is not growing outside the uterus.
Stage II — The cancer has invaded the cervix and uterus, but not the walls of the pelvis or the lower part of the vagina.
Stage III — The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis, and it may be blocking the ureters. It may have spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis but not to distant parts of your body.
Stage IV — The most advanced stage of cancer in which the cancer has spread (metastasized) to distant parts of your body.;
, Cancer of any stage can be confirmed with a cone biopsy, which is a procedure in which the doctor excises (cuts out) the lesion on your cervix and then examines it under the microscope. Stage 0 can be treated with minor surgical measures such as cryosurgery, laser ablation, and loop excision.


The microscope examination confirms the diagnosis of cancer, and also informs your doctor about whether or not all of the cancer cells have effectively been removed.
After treatment, you will require lifelong surveillance to ensure all of the cancerous cells were removed and/or that the cancer doesn't return.

, It all depends on the ""margins."" This means that when your doctor examines the piece that was removed under the microscope, they will check the margins (or border) of the section that was removed to ensure that these are cancer-free.


If the margins are cancer-free, it usually means that the entire cancer has been removed. You may not need any further treatment.
If the margins contain cancer cells, it means that the cancer was not completely cured and you will need to talk to your doctor about further treatment options, covered in the next section of this article.

, Generally, both the cervix and the uterus are removed, and additional structures may be removed if the cancer has invaded beyond these areas. The extent of the surgery will depend upon the stage and severity of the cancer. This is usually how stage I cervical cancer is treated.


Recovery time from surgery is generally about six weeks.
Surgery for cervical cancer is by a radical hysterectomy which is more invasive than a regular hysterectomy. The hospital stay is usually for two or more days.
The downside to surgery as a means to treat cervical cancer is that, by removing the uterus, you will no longer be able to carry your own children should you wish to have children down the road.You may need surgical treatment or radiation treatment as well as chemotherapy.
Women with late stage cancer are not candidates for surgery.

Do not cut the corn away.",How to Treat Corns1," If you have a large, hard, thick protrusion, made entirely of skin, it is likely that you have a corn or a callous. If it bleeds or oozes it is not a corn. Instead it might be a wart.


A corn will have a center of skin that is of a slightly different thickness than the rest of the mass, whereas a callous will be consistent throughout. It can be hard to distinguish the two, but it is not necessary. You will treat both the same way.;
, This is the simplest way to get rid of a corn. The skin will become soft after soaking, and you will be able to easily remove the dead skin. Just soak your problem area in warm water for ten or twenty minutes. Use a pumice stone to gently sand the corn away. Repeat the treatment as many times as necessary., Like soaking the foot, moisturizing cream will soften the corn, making it easier to remove with a pumice stone. Apply ample cream and allow it to sink in and loosen up the skin. Repeat this process until the corn has been removed.


One strategy is to apply ample cream and cover overnight with a plastic bag or sock. This will trap in the moisture. In the morning use the pumice stone to remove the dead skin.
Alternatively you can shower, apply moisturizer, and then rub off the dead skin.Moisturizers with the active ingredient “urea” can be particularly effective for treating corns and callouses.

, As mentioned in previous steps, you will want to rub the corn with an abrasive surface to help remove the dead skin. Do not, however, take a sharp object and try to cut the corn. This can be extremely dangerous.

Wear a brace.,
Go to physiotherapy.,
Try massage and manual manipulation.,
Exercise your hand.,
Try the nerve gliding exercise.,
Practice the tendon gliding exercise.",How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Without Surgery1," This physical intervention is also called splinting and is commonly prescribed since it is a cheap and non invasive way of treating carpal tunnel syndrome. With this method, a lightweight plastic or wooden splint is applied under your palm, wrist and lower arm and is fastened around these areas to minimize the amount of bending that your wrist can do. By decreasing the amount that your wrist can bend, you can decrease the pain, numbness, weakness and the tingling sensations you are experiencing.The brace will keep your wrist in a neutral position, which will not only minimize your symptoms, but also allow your compressed nerve to begin to recover.
Splinting is usually prescribed by your orthopedic specialist; he or she will prescribe the length of time that you have to wear the brace based on your own specific condition.;
, This is a form of rehabilitation that uses various methods to restore the functional use of your upper arm. Hand therapy is usually performed by a licensed physiotherapist or a registered physical therapist because they have the specialized skills to assess and evaluate each patient with carpal tunnel syndrome.


Your physical therapist may manually manipulate your affected hand, massage the area that is in pain, and apply a special tape (kinesiology tape) around your upper arm to promote recovery. These will be described further in the following step.

, Massage therapy involves soothing and relaxing the tensed and inflamed muscles of your hand and wrist. It employs repetitive, circular, and one directional strokes that help to ease the pain of the inflamed area. It is generally performed by a physical therapist.


Another intervention used in hand therapy is manual manipulation. This method is used by orthopedic surgeons, chiropractors and physical therapists to realign the affected joints and bones. Your therapist will make a sudden, but smooth, motion of extending and flexing your bone or joint to correct its anatomical position.
Lastly, the use of kinesiology tape enables your therapist to bind the muscle fibers firmly together, relieving the affected part of pain and inflammation. It is also known to improve circulation in the affected area to facilitate healing and repair.

, Certain hand exercise routines can be conducted to improve the functioning of your affected hand as well as decrease the occurrence of the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Two of these exercises include: nerve gliding exercise and tendon gliding exercise. They will be discussed in detail in the following steps.

, Place your hand nearly level with your face so that your hand is in front of you. Your wrist should be in its neutral position and your palm should be facing away from you.Clench your fingers to form a fist while maintaining the wrist in its straight or neutral position. Straighten your fingers with your thumb close to your index finger.
Bend your wrist backward and hold this position for several moments. Bring your thumb forward and away from your other fingers then rotate your palm to face you.
Using your other hand, stretch your extended thumb out for two seconds.
Repeat this process five times, three to four times a day.

, This exercise is also called the rubber band finger stretch. This exercise is intended to strengthen the muscles that open the hand and create balance with the muscles responsible for closing your hands.Place a thick rubber band around all of your fingers and thumb. Spread your fingers widely against the resistance exerted by the rubber band and hold this position for two to three seconds. After this time has passed, bring them back to the starting position.
Try to repeat this process 10 times during the duration of one hour. If you find that it is easy to do this exercise, add another rubber band for extra resistance. Allow yourself rest in between repetitions.

Find a doctor that specializes in Castleman Disease.,
Ask the doctor questions.,
Inform the doctor of any changes in symptoms.,
Undergo tests.",How to Treat Castleman Disease1," Since CD is rare, your doctor or oncologist may not be experienced in treating it. Try to find an oncologist with experience in treating CD. The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) maintains a database of known skilled doctors. Note that over the course of your treatment, you might have to see a hematologist, oncologist, and surgeon.These doctors may diagnose your condition as being either localized or multicentric CD.


Localized (unicentric) Castleman Disease is the most common type. It only affects a single group of lymph nodes. It is usually treated with surgical removal of the mass.
Multicentric Castleman Disease (MCD) is a rarer form, wherein the masses appear on multiple lymph nodes and organs. It may be treated with both surgery and chemotherapy.Make sure that your doctor knows if you are HIV-positive. While not all cases of MCD are caused by HIV, HIV puts you at increased risk for it.;
, It is important that you are informed about all possible treatment options for your CD. You also want to make sure that your doctor has the right experience and tools to treat this disease effectively. You might ask:Have you ever treated this disease before? If not, can you refer me to a doctor who has?
What types of tests are you going to need to do?
Do you think that my CD is related to HIV?
Was my biopsy reviewed by a pathologist who has experience with CD?
Is the CD localized or multicentric?
When do I need to start treatment? How long will treatment last?
Do I qualify for any current clinical trials?
Will I need to undergo follow-up care after treatment?

, If you have localized CD, you may not exhibit any symptoms, but if symptoms develop, let your doctor know immediately. These symptoms may indicate that the disease is worsening. They may also demonstrate that you have MCD instead of unicentric. These symptoms may include:Enlarged lymph nodes
Fever
Night sweats
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Weakness and fatigue
Shortness of breath
Nausea and vomiting
Skin rashes

, There are a number of tests your doctor may administer to determine the exact type of CD that you have. This will help your doctor decide which type of treatment is right for you. Typical tests for CD include:Blood and urine tests: Your doctor will take samples of blood or urine to test for elevated levels of a substance called Interleukin-6 (IL-6).

Imaging tests: Imaging tools including CT scans, PET scans, MRI scans, or ultrasound will look for growths on your lymph nodes to identify where the affected nodes are located.

Lymph node biopsy: Through a minimally invasive surgery, your doctor will extract a sample of the affected tissue and study it. This may help diagnose a microscopic subtype of your CD. This subtype will help identify how aggressively the CD might spread as well as your prognosis.

Inquire about radiation.If you have later stage cancer or if surgery is not your preference and you have stage I cancer, talk to your doctor about radiation therapy.,
Undergo chemotherapy treatments.When chemotherapy is combined with radiation, as described above, it is termed ""chemoradiation."",
Understand that you may need to have some of your eggs frozen prior to treatment.",How to Treat Cervical Cancer2," Radiation therapy requires multiple visits, but the advantage is that it is not invasive like surgery (i.e. it does not require cutting into you to remove the cancer). There are two types of radiation that are commonly used to treat cervical cancer. The first is called external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), in which the radioactive beams are emitted from a source outside your body and directed toward your cervix and the surrounding area. The second type of radiation therapy is called brachytherapy — rods containing radiation are inserted through the vagina up against the cervix. They are then left there for one to two days and emit local radiation which works to treat the cervical cancer. This is done in the hospital.


Again, the extent of radiation as well as the effectiveness of this mode of treatment depends upon the stage and severity of your cervical cancer.
Radiation treatment can have significant side effects. EBRT may cause fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea, skin damage, bladder discomfort, vaginal pain, anemia, and menstrual changes (including early menopause). Brachytherapy may cause irritation of the vagina and vulva. Fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, irritation of the bladder, and low blood counts may also occur.Long-term effects of radiation treatment may include vaginal scarring, which may make vaginal sex painful. You may also experience vaginal dryness, swelling of the legs, and it may weaken your bones.
Radiation is most commonly combined with chemotherapy. This is because, for cervical cancer, the combination of radiation and chemotherapy is synergistic and provides significant additional benefit (rather than simply opting for one or the other).

, This can be a very effective mode of treatment, because the chemotherapy has what is called a ""sensitizing effect"" on the tissues on and around the cervix. What this means is that the tissues then become more susceptible to the radiation, and it is as such that the combined modality of treatment gains its synergistic effect.

, Unfortunately, many of the most effective methods for treating cervical cancer can have deleterious effects on one's future ability to have children. As a result, your doctor may recommend that you freeze some of your eggs prior to undergoing treatment such as radiation, so that the eggs do not become damaged due to the treatment.


Most women will need to have a surrogate carry the pregnancy if they freeze their eggs.

"
"
Ask about your prognosis.,
Be sure to follow through with regular testing after your treatment.In general, people are advised to see their doctor for a physical exam of their pelvic area every three to four months for two years following treatment.,
Be aware that you may need to modify your sex life after treatment.Recovery from treatments, in particular radiation (and to a degree surgery), can have a significant impact on the sex life of some women.",How to Treat Cervical Cancer3," The good news is that the prognosis (outlook) for cervical cancer is excellent when treated early.The faster you see your doctor for treatment of your cervical cancer, the better your chances of remaining cancer-free in the long-run will be. For Stage 1 cancers (ones that are caught very early), there is a 95% cure rate.

, Additionally, a Pap test is recommended annually for surveillance purposes post treatment.


In general, additional diagnostic tests such as MRIs or ultrasounds are not required unless you show symptoms suggestive of a recurrence of cancer (such as abnormal bleeding from the vagina, or unusual pain during sexual intercourse not related to the aftermath of receiving treatment).

, For others, however, it is not such an issue. Concerns that may arise following treatment for your cervical cancer include pain with intercourse and possibly a decreased libido. These are due to shrinking of the vaginal tissues that often accompanies treatment, as well as changes to your hormones that may ensue following treatment.


The good news, however, is that with time and dedication most of these potential obstacles can be overcome.
Your physician may suggest using additional lubricant, and/or a vaginal dilator to help recover your sex life as best as possible.
You and your partner may also opt for counselling and/or coaching to guide you in how to move forward successfully in this area following treatment.

Change shoes.,
Trim your toenails.,
Use silicone wedges.,
Wear protective pads.",How to Treat Corns2," Corns are generally caused by ill-fitting shoes. Purchase a new pair of shoes. Measure your feet at the store to determine if you have been purchasing shoes of the right of size. Typically, corns are a sign that your footwear is too tight.If corns are developing on the front of your toe, it is probably because the shoes are not long enough, whereas if it is developing between toes, it is because they are not wide enough. If you are getting them on the back of your foot near the heel, it is probably because the shoes are too loose.High heels can also cause corns. Refrain from wearing these if you have an issue with corns.

, It is possible that your shoes suddenly aren’t fitting because you have allowed your nails to get too long. When the shoe becomes too tight on your foot, friction is created which in turn can lead to the growth of a corn., Wedges fit around or between toes to prevent them from rubbing together. This will limit friction, slowing the development of corns. Place the wedge on the affected area and walk normally., Orthotic shoe inserts or moleskin will hold the foot in a comfortable position and prevent it from rubbing on the shoe. Insert the pads where you are feeling discomfort."
"
Use salicylic acid.,
Get corrective surgery.,
Seek medical assistance if the corn becomes infected.",How to Treat Corns3," Many solutions with salicylic acid are sold over the counter to treat corns. Apply the acid directly on the corn; it will help soften the skin that has been hardened. Be careful to apply the acid only on the lesion, as it can harm the healthy tissues surrounding it. Use the remedy each day, after you shower or take a bath, until the condition is treated.You may want to purchase salicylic acid plaster patches, which are sold over the counter and contain up to 40% salicylic acid. To use the patch, file down the corn, then cut the patch to an appropriate size and apply over the corn. Keep the plaster in place for 48 to 72 hours and keep it dry. You can apply these until the corn has disappeared; make sure you are using a pumice to remove dead skin between each application.

, Surgical removal of corns are rare, because they often return after removal.If your doctor for some reason considers surgery, it is more likely that they will shave the bone or correct a deformity that it is creating an unnatural gait. Once you are walking normally, your corns might cease to appear. This procedure, however, is rare. , If the corn is painful, discolored, swelling, or draining liquid, it is likely that it has become infected. The doctor might perform a small operation to drain the liquid or prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.

Rest the affected wrist and hand for at least two weeks.,
Apply a cold compress during the acute stage.,
Use a warm compress after the initial six weeks.,
Try a paraffin wax bath.",How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Without Surgery2," This is extremely important because immobilization of the affected wrist lessens stress and strain placed on it during movement, which allow the area to heal. During wrist motions, the tendons and ligaments of the small muscles of your hands and fingers that pass through the carpal tunnel slide and glide, which causes friction on other soft tissue structures. If this continues, it could make your condition worse.


Part of resting your wrist is wearing the brace described in the first step of this article. You may also be advised by your doctor to refrain from participating in activities that cause your to bend your wrist. This could include typing.

, If the condition is still in the acute stage (you have been experiencing the symptoms for less than six weeks) a cold compress can help to minimize swelling and inflammation. The cold compress restricts the blood vessels in the area, both numbing your pain and reducing swelling.Wrap a cold compress or pack of ice in a hand towel. Do not apply the ice or compress directly to your skin, as prolonged exposures to cold temperatures could lead to skin damage. Hold the compress on the area for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove the compress to keep from damaging your skin.

, If the condition is already in the chronic state (you have been experiencing it for more than 6 weeks) cold compresses won’t work anymore. Instead, apply a hot compress or heat to the area to soothe the pain (the area should not be swollen at this time—if it is swollen, do not apply heat). The heat increases blood flow to the area, which can help to speed up the recovery process.


Wrap a heated compress or hot water bottle in a hand towel. Hold the compress against your wrist for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Your physical therapist (PT) may apply a paraffin wax to your wrist and hand. The wax will be heated in a special heater to roughly 125 degrees F (roughly 51 degrees C). While this may sound hot (as it should) touching 125 degree F paraffin is actually cooler than touching water that has been heated to 125 degrees F.Your PT will dip your hand and wrist the wax 10 or more times, each time allowing the wax to harden before your hand gets dipped in again. This helps to trap the therapeutic heat inside the wax glove, allowing the heat to fight pain and speed up the healing process. The wax will be left on your hand for 15 to 20 minutes and then removed.

"
"
Use NSAIDs to relieve pain and inflammation.,
Get a prescription for a topical anesthetic.,
Take corticosteroids.",How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Without Surgery3," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to fight pain and inflammation, which in turn can help to reduce the compression of your medial nerve.


You can purchase NSAIDs over the counter at your local pharmacy. Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and celecoxib.

, A eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) can help to fight the pain associated with the compression of your median nerve. EMLA is made up of two topical anesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine. You can purchase EMLA in a cream or ointment form.


Apply the EMLA to the area where you feel pain two to three times a day. Your physician may prescribe a specific dosage depending on your condition.

, The two commonly prescribed corticosteroids used to combat carpal tunnel syndrome include betamethasone and methylprednisolone. They work to fight inflammation, which in turn can help to relieve your pain. They can also help to speed up the healing process.The usual dosage of betamethasone for carpal tunnel syndrome is a 20 mg tablet once a day every morning. Methylprednisolone on the other hand is a similar corticosteroid that is usually dosed at 10 to 40 mg per day, depending on your symptoms and the severity of your condition.Although corticosteroid injections are usually prescribed and administered by your health care provider, you can also get oral corticosteroids if you are uncomfortable with injections or have an increase bleeding tendency.

Treat carpal tunnel with acupuncture.,
Receive laser treatments.,
Practice yoga.",How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Without Surgery4," In this alternative form of treatment, needles are used to stimulate acupuncture points. Two points, PC5 and PC6, are targeted in particular. These points are located near each other, just above the wrist crease.The stimulation of these points is thought to reduce pressure and swelling in the area that leads to pain and numbness.

, In this alternative treatment procedure, low level lasers are applied along the course of the median nerve to relieve the patient of the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. It is hypothesized that laser light can penetrate deeply in the tissues where it has a “photo-bio-simulative effect”. It is also believed to improve cellular repair by stimulating the immune and circulatory system.A medical practitioner with expertise in low level laser therapy will usually perform this therapy. The session is done once to see if it will be effective for you; if the symptoms subside, it can be done at least once every two to four weeks.

, Another alternative treatment to carpal tunnel syndrome is the performance of yoga routines, specifically those routines that focus on upper body postures and awareness of proper structural alignment and focuses on opening, stretching, and strengthening of the joints of the upper body.A beneficial yoga program for carpal tunnel syndrome would be a 1 to 1.5 hour session twice a week for a period of two months.

Go in for surgery.,
Get a prescription.,
Undergo chemotherapy.,
Go through radiation therapy.,
Take corticosteroids.",How to Treat Castleman Disease2," Surgery is the most effective way to treat localized CD. It is sometimes also used to reduce the symptoms of MCD, although it cannot remove it the same way that it can localized CD. During the surgery, the surgeon will remove the mass. The severity of the surgery depends on where the affected lymph nodes are located. Some patients are able to go home after the surgery while others, especially those whose affected nodes are deep in the chest, may have to remain in the hospital for several days.Follow your surgeon’s advice before and after the procedure.
Some questions you may want to ask your surgeon before the surgery include ""How long will I have to remain in the hospital?""; ""What will I have to do after the surgery to recover?""; ""Am I at risk for any side effects during this surgery?""; ""Should I discontinue taking any medications before I go in?""
If you have MCD and the spleen is growing too large, the surgeons may decide to remove it entirely.

, Immunotherapy drugs may be the most effective for your CD. While the use of prescription drugs is still undergoing research, some have been found to be effective in managing the size and expansion of the masses. If prescribed a drug, ask your doctor if these medications interfere with any other medications you are taking, including aspirin and birth control.


There may be a connection between MCD and human herpes virus type 8. Because of this, your doctor will likely choose antivirals for follow-up treatment.Siltuximab (Sylvant) may be used for those with MCD who are also HIV negative.Side effects include constipation, headaches, weight gain, and throat, mouth, or stomach pain. If a rash or infection develops while on siltuximab, contact your doctor immediately.Rituximab (Rituxan) may be prescribed for those who are HIV positive. Antiviral agents may also be prescribed.Common side effects include chills, fever, or other cold-like symptoms. If you become confused, dizzy, or weak on one side of your body, contact your doctor immediately.Monthly injections of tocilizumab (Actemra), which is typically used for rheumatoid arthritis, have also been approved for off-label use on CD.Let your doctor know if you have muscle pain, fever, night sweats, mouth or skin sores, or blurred vision.Taking both tocilizumab and rituximab at the same time may increase your risk of infection.

, If your MCD is severe, you may have to undergo chemotherapy. The treatments for MCD are very similar to those for lymphoma. You will most likely be given a combination of chemotherapy drugs, given to you either as a pill or by injection. You may be cycled through weeks of chemotherapy followed by a few weeks of rest.Chemotherapy can cause a wide range of side effects, including hair loss, mouth sores, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infection, fatigue, and weakness. It also make you more susceptible to bruising or bleeding. Let your medical team know about your symptoms, and they will prescribe ways to manage them.
Chemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiation therapy and corticosteroids.

, Radiation therapy is the use of a powerful beam of radiation to reduce the spread and size of your tumors. It is an alternative to surgery for those whose localized CD is difficult to reach. Doctors will place you under a device similar to an X-ray where a beam will target the mass for several minutes. You may have to go in for treatment as often as five days a week for several weeks.Radiation therapy can cause rashes, nausea, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.

, Corticosteroids can be used alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat MCD. Your doctor may either inject it or they may give you a pill, like Prednisone, to take. Side effects may include increased blood sugar, mood swings, infection, weakened bones, fatigue, muscle weakness, weight gain, fluid retention, and high blood pressure."

Find support and research organizations.,
Join a clinical trial.,
Donate your tissue to research.,
Confide in your family and friends.",How to Treat Castleman Disease3," National support groups and organizations help provide emotional support as well as information about new research and treatments. While CD is rare, there are active networks that can help put you in touch with others suffering from the same disease.


The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network maintains an active community of researchers, family, and people with CD. They also provide updates on recent research into the disease.RareConnect maintains an international, online support group for those with CD.
Although CD is not cancer, the American Cancer Society provides general support, as CD can potentially develop into lymphoma. Furthermore, many of the symptoms and treatments available are similar to cancer treatments.

, Clinical trials are research projects on new medications. While the trials are still experimental, they can potentially provide new, cutting edge treatments before they are available widely. By participating in these trials, you can help advance research on CD.


The US National Institute of Health keeps a database of clinical trials for CD that are currently active, recruiting, or completed.
The CDCN maintains a database of people with CD to aid researchers. By adding your information and pathology report to the ACCELERATE Patient Registry, you can contribute to research for treatments., Another way to contribute to new research is to donate your affected tissue after a biopsy or surgery. The CDCN currently manages collections of tissue for research. To see if you qualify, you can fill out a form on their website.

, Your personal support network will be invaluable in helping you remain strong and healthy during this time. If you are feeling upset, scared, or nervous, find someone you trust to talk to about these problems.


If you don't have someone close to you for support, you can still reach out to others. Places of worship can coordinate someone to help you with daily tasks if needed. Schools and universities may be able to provide accommodation. Your coworkers may be willing to pick up slack around the office.
Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need someone to give you rides to appointments, treatments, and possibly the hospital. Make sure you have one or two people who can commit to taking you.
If you are feeling depressed, hopeless, or anxious, you may want to contact a licensed therapist.

Rest.,
Exercise healthily.,
Consider acupressure therapy.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Maintain low cholesterol levels.,
Avoid or minimize the intake of high fat condiments, such as butter and mayonnaise.,
Ask your doctor about medication.,
Talk to your doctor about electrical stimulation.,
Consider surgery.,
Get physical therapy and stick to it.,
Know what avascular necrosis really is.,
Know the risk factors and causes.,
Know what the symptoms are.,
Know how AVN gets diagnosed.",How to Treat Avascular Necrosis," Decreasing the amount of stress and weight on the affected bones will result in a huge amount of pain relief, slow the damage rate, and give your body a chance to heal. Apart from physical therapy, make efforts to minimize your daily physical activity movement as much as possible.


You may need the aid of crutches or a walker if the affected joint is your hip, knee or ankle. Consider crutches an invitation to stay off your legs. However, crutches should only be used upon the advice of your physiotherapist.;
, You should see a physiotherapist to show you certain exercises to maintain or enhance your joint movement. The physiotherapist's role is to help you using the walking aid at first and then slowly wean you off it. Improvement will lead you to some stretching exercises that you can do in the clinic or at home.


The exercise bike is helpful too, as the forward and backward moves will assist the joint's overall state, increase the blood flow and keep your hip and associated muscles strong.
Your motion improvement and strength will help the physiotherapist to choose the proper exercises that best suit you and guide you on how to perform them on your own.

, This is another helpful method done by pressing certain areas/points on the body that help in relaxation. Talk to your physical therapist about acupressure. You can do it yourself regularly or you can make an appointment with a professional and turn it into a full-on day of veritable stress-blasting.


Alternatively, performing simple yoga or massage therapy (especially for the buttocks, anterior/lateral hip muscles and back) is also helpful in relaxing and avoiding stress. The more relaxed you are, the better you'll feel 24/7.

, Drinking alcohol is one of the risk factors of developing AVN. Continually drinking alcohol will worsen your case due to the elevated levels of fatty substances in your blood which tend to accumulate and block your blood vessels in the affected areas. Stick to a glass of red wine at night if need be.


There are a number of reasons you should limit your alcohol intake, or consider quitting entirely. Sure, one glass of wine a day is okay, but any more of that can wreak havoc on your heart, organs, and, obviously, your bones. Take care of your body and go non-alcoholic.

, Ensure a healthy, low-fat diet by avoiding hydrogenated oils, fried food, and reducing your intake of whole fat dairy products, which you can replace with low or non fat alternatives. Doing this will keep your cholesterol levels to a minimum, helping your blood and heart.


When adding red meat to your diet, make sure to trim any visible fat before cooking.
Consume food rich in Omega 3 fatty acids as fish, walnuts, flax seeds, soybeans, tuna and olive oil. Avoid frying the olive oil as it’ll destruct the omega 3s in it and lose all the benefits.

, Take your needed fats from healthy sources such as raw nuts, vegetable oils like olive oil and cold water fish such as salmon and mackerel. Eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains without butter, cheese, and cream sauces.


If you’re diabetic, make sure to always control your blood sugar levels within a normal state. Consult your doctor immediately if you’re facing any sudden high or low sugar concentrations, as diabetes is considered one of the risk factors that may lead to AVN. Adjusting your glucose level should be one of your top priorities by paying attention to your food and medicines.

, Here's the knowledge you should be armed with:


Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed for relieving pain and reducing inflammation (redness, swelling, pain). Well-known NSAIDs in the pharmacies are Ibuprofen and Diclofenac salts (“Voltaren or Cataflam”); most are available in variable dosage forms.

Tablets should be taken when needed (when having pain) but a usual dose of Voltaren 50 mg twice daily after meals should be enough.


Osteoporosis drugs such as Alendronate (“Fosamax”) helps in slowing the progression of AVN.
Cholesterol drugs are used to decrease the fat concentration in the blood circulation caused by the intake of corticosteroids; this prevents blood vessel blockage that leads to AVN.
Blood thinners such as Warfarin help patients with clotting disorders to prevent clot formation that can block the blood vessels.

, This is a process that stimulates the body to grow new bones to replace the damaged area. It’s performed during surgery by being applied around the bones as electromagnetic fields, putting electricity directly to the bones or by attaching electrodes to your skin. It's not surgery per se, but it is generally used in conjunction with surgery.


If surgery puts your bones in line, electrical stimulation sets the ball in motion. However, it's not right for everyone, so ask your doctor if it's a feasible option.

, More than 50% of patients with AVN will need a surgical treatment in about 3 years of diagnosis.Your doctor will determine which type of surgical therapy you may need. Here are the details:



Core decompression. The surgeon removes parts of the bone's inner layer. The aim of this is to decrease the pressure inside, increase the blood flow, and let the extra space stimulate new healthy bone tissue production with new blood vessels.

Bone transplant (graft). This is a transplantation process of a healthy bone section from another site of your body to support the affected area, usually done after a core decompression. Increasing the blood supply may be done by performing a vascular graft, including both an artery and a vein.

Bone reshaping (osteotomy). This is where the surgeon removes a section of the affected bone above or below a weight bearing joint to change its shape in order to decrease the stress on it. This is effective for early stages/small areas and postpones the joint replacement.

Joint replacement. In late stages, when totally collapsed or damaged and with medication failure, the damaged joint is replaced with an artificial one, usually made from plastic or metal parts.

, After surgery, it is absolutely imperative that your bones A) heal, and B) heal correctly. Physical therapy (done regularly) will ensure that both of these things happen. Here's how it's beneficial:


Your physical therapist will hook you up with crutches, a walker, or some device to reduce the weight the joint has to bear. This will greatly speed up the healing process.
Your physical therapist will work on exercises with you to prevent joint deformity and improve your joint flexibility and mobility. Very important things!

, Avascular necrosis (AVN) or osteonecrosis is defined as the death of bone tissue due to lack and loss of blood supply to a particular bone. The affected bone will have tiny breaks which, overall, would lead to bone collapse. If AVN affects bones near a joint, the joint surface may collapse. Usually, the affected bone or joint area in AVN is the hip.AVN occurs in bones with a single terminal blood or end-artery supply (meaning there is a limited blood supply), such as the femoral (hip) and humeral (shoulder) heads, carpals (hand bones), and talus (foot bones). Closure or interruption of this single terminal blood supply will lead to death of bone tissue and, later, bone collapse.
Although bone tissue regenerates or grows back again, the rate of bone destruction is faster than bone regeneration. If the bone collapses, the joint structure breaks down and leads to pain. Corticosteriods and radiation applied to the bone may further contribute to progression of AVN.

, Some causes can increase your risk of developing AVN. Any of the following can lead to AVN:


A bone fracture or joint dislocation can interrupt blood flow
Radiation during cancer treatment weakens the bone and affects the blood vessels
Elevated pressure inside the bone causes the blood vessels to narrow and make it difficult for fresh blood to enter leading to poor blood supply
Alcohol intake in huge amounts (daily for several years) causes fats to accumulate in blood vessels and block them
Medications such as corticosteroids (Prednisolone) when taken on a long basis in high doses can increase your risk of AVN. Other medication such as biphosphate (a treatment for osteoporosis), when used over long periods, can lead to a rare condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Diseases such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, sickle cell anemia, organ transplantation, and dialysis can lead to AVN

, Often AVN is missed because, early in the course of this disorder, there are no symptoms. The first symptom present is pain in the affected bone/joint such as groin pain in AVN of the femoral head. Here are the specifics:


This groin pain is worsened by weight-bearing, may be mild or worsen progressively across time. Pain may occur at rest or at night.
Walking with a limp may be seen in the case of the involvement of the hip joint, and pain on pressure will be felt on or around the particularly affected bone.
Joint movements may be limited and painful. The affected joint may be deformed or disfigured through time.
If a nerve is compressed in the area of the affected bone or joint, the muscles supplied by that nerve may be paralyzed and deformed through time.

Usually, signs and symptoms occur late in the course of the disease and patients consult doctors when the disease is more advanced than it had to be. Without treatment, the affected joint will be destroyed within five years from the start of AVN., During the examination, your doctor will identify your state by pressing around the pain site checking for tenderness. He may need you to perform certain moves or body positions -- that will help in knowing if any certain movement or joint position will increase or decrease the pain, or if your movement is reduced. To determine your state and if surgery is necessary, your doctor may require any of the following:



X-rays. It usually appears normal in the early stages, but in later stages it reveals clear bone change

Bone scan. Via an intravenous line, a safe radioactive material is slowly injected in your vein. The material flows with your blood circulation till it reaches its destination; a picture on a special device will show the affected sites as clear bright spots. This method is commonly used when the X-ray results are normal.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging “MRI”. This is known as the most sensitive method for the early stages of AVN because it reveals any chemical change in the bone marrow and bone rebuilding process. This is done by radio waves and a strong magnetic field.

Computerized Tomography “CT scan”. This is more clear than x-rays and bone scans; it determines the extent of bone damage by taking a three dimensional picture of the bone.

Bone biopsy. This is a procedure wherein a small amount of bone tissue is taken and examined using the microscope in order to view the microscopic appearance of AVN.

Irritability
Dizziness
Increased heart rate
Difficulty breathing
Slowed growth
Pale skin;
, Splenic sequestration occurs when a large number of sickle cells get trapped in the spleen, causing it to rapidly enlarge.


Splenic sequestration is a potentially deadly condition that should be treated immediately with a hospital visit and may result in having the spleen removed.Symptoms include sudden worsening of anemia, weakness and fatigue, pale lips, rapid breathing, constant thirst, and pain in the stomach area.

, A stroke can occur when the sickle-shaped cells impede blood flow to the brain. Often, this happens because the cells are stuck in blood vessels in or near the brain.Signs of a stroke include sudden weakness usually one side in an upper and/or lower extremity, sudden speech difficulties, loss of consciousness, and seizures.
Strokes in children with SCD may cause learning difficulties and long-lasting disabilities.

, These red, exposed breaks or holes in the skin typically appear on the lower part of the leg, usually showing up between the ages of 10 to 50. Such ulcers are more common in men.


Ulcers may form due to trauma, infection of a wound, inflammation, or an interruption of circulation in the leg’s small blood vessels.
Leg ulcers are visible openings in the skin, so regular visual inspection is the easiest way to detect them.

, Vision loss, and in some cases blindness, can happen when blood vessels in the eye become blocked with sickle-cells, damaging the retina.In some patients, extra blood vessels may develop in the eye due to lack of oxygen.
Vision loss can be monitored and minimized. It is important to work with not only a physician, but an ophthalmologist familiar with SCD to properly manage any potential vision loss.

, Acute chest syndrome manifests much like pneumonia with symptoms that include chest pain, coughing, difficulty breathing, and fever.


Acute chest syndrome can be life-threatening. Do not attempt to treat it at home — go to the hospital immediately for treatment.Chest pain is more common in adults, while fever, coughing, and abdominal pain are more common in children and infants.If not treated quickly, acute chest syndrome may cause rapid inability to breathe, and could be fatal.

, When sickle cells journey through small blood vessels, they may become stuck and clog the flow of blood. This can cause pain episodes or extremely painful crises.Such pain often strikes quickly, and is described as intense stabbing or throbbing sensations.
It may be mild to severe, and can last for any amount of time from a few seconds to multiple days.
Pain often occurs in the lower back, limbs, abdomen, and chest.

, People with SCD, chiefly infants and children, are more at risk for harmful infections. Damage to the spleen, in particular, makes those with SCD vulnerable to infection by certain bacteria such as e. Coli and salmonella.


Infections from common illnesses such as the flu or pneumonia can quickly become dangerous for those with SCD.
The most common infection-causing organisms for those with SCD are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, both of which are known to cause pneumonia, blood infections, and meningitis., Sickle cells get lodged in the blood vessels and block the flow of blood in and out of the hands and feet, causing the extremities to swell. This is commonly the first symptom of the disease.Symptoms include swelling in the hands and feet, as well as extreme pain and tenderness.
While often painful, hand-foot syndrome does not harm the body.

, Sickle-cell anemia can be treated, but the only proven options require a medical professional.Blood transfusions are used to treat severe anemia, along with supplemental oxygen. Blood transfusion are especially common if anemia is made worse by an infection of the spleen.
Patients requiring multiple transfusions may also have to undergo iron chelation therapy in order to avoid hemosiderosis, or an overload of iron in the blood.
Iron supplements will not help those with sickle-cell anemia. This anemia is not caused by an iron deficiency, but rather is brought on by having too few red blood cells. Taking iron could cause a harmful buildup in the body, which could damage internal organs.

, As fluid sometimes builds when blood is released from the spleen, treatment should only be done under the supervision of a medical professional to monitor fluid levels.Blood may need to be removed from the spleen to prevent patients from being overloaded with fluid.
Only a specialist should provide transfusions for treatment.

, Strokes, like many complications of SCD, should only be treated by a medical professional. If someone with SCD reports signs of a stroke, immediately get them to the nearest hospital or call an emergency number such as 9-1-1.


If not treated quickly, a stroke may be fatal.
A doctor’s diagnosis will determine what treatment is right for a stroke. Neuro-imaging and a blood transfusion are common first responses.
Depending on the levels of damage after a stroke, cognitive and physical therapy may be necessary for rehabilitation., A doctor may prescribe a topical treatment to help heal leg ulcers and reduce the risk of infection.


In cases where the ulcers cause severe pain, a strong pain medication may also be prescribed.
A doctor may recommend bed rest and keeping the legs elevated if the ulcers are severe or large enough to interfere with daily activity. This may also help reduce swelling., Often, it can prevent further vision loss if the retina is damaged due to excessive blood vessel growth.Laser eye treatments will be performed by a specialist. Consult with an ophthalmologist to get a referral.

, Problems with acute chest syndrome must be intensely monitored, and will be treated differently depending upon the origin of the problem.Acute chest syndrome is commonly caused by respiratory infections such as pneumonia, as well as fat embolisms. Fat embolisms are a blockage of blood vessels caused by dislodged fat.
Depending on the originator, treatment could include oxygen therapy and antibiotics for infection-related symptoms.
For embolism symptoms, medicine to open up blood vessels for better blood flow, oxygen therapy, and/or blood transfusions may be necessary.
Any reports of symptoms related to acute chest syndrome in an individual with SCD warrant an immediate hospital visit.

, Acute pain episodes do not always require hospitalization. Talk with a doctor to develop a plan for SCD-related pains.Many specialty clinics also work with local Emergency Rooms to avoid too many procedures and interventions, and start to manage your pain quickly. Electronic Medical Records are also making it easier to share treatment plans. However, you may want to keep a copy with you in case you need to go to a hospital that does not have access to your records.
Many doctors recommend taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication and drinking plenty of fluids as a first step for pain episodes.
Pain medications may be coupled with massages or heating pads to further relax pained areas.
The doctor may prescribe a stronger medicine for persistent pains.
For pain that cannot be controlled, the patient should opt for an emergency room or outpatient clinic visit to seek stronger medication and professional treatment.

, The type of infection will determine what antibiotic treatment is necessary. Consult a medical professional at the first sign of an infection, such as a fever, for a screening to determine the reason for infection.Let the doctor know right away about any potential allergies to antibiotics such as penicillin.
For blood infections, a blood transfusion may be necessary.

, A doctor will often recommend treating swelling of the hands and feet with over-the-counter pain medication and lots of fluids.Applying a cold compress to the affected areas may further help reduce the swelling. Alternate on and off the compress for about 20 minutes at a time.Consult with a medical professional to see if a vitamin B6 supplement would be helpful in controlling repeated episodes of swelling.
If swelling persists, visit a medical professional for further evaluation.

, Transfusions of healthy red blood cells may help reduce the risk of a recurrent episode.


Surgical spleen removal, or a splenectomy, may be necessary for some patients depending on the recommendations of their doctor.
If an episode of splenic sequestration has not already occurred, there is currently no proven way to prevent it, but working with a doctor is key to catching any signs early and lessening its likelihood.

, This ultrasound method is non-invasive, and examines blood circulation within the brain. Using TCD, doctors can periodically identify children who are at risk for a stroke.An ultrasound can be completed by a trained technologist or a registered nurse in around 30 minutes.
Sometimes, a doctor might recommend repeated blood transfusions as a means of stroke prevention.

, A yearly visit to an eye doctor is recommended for anyone with SCD.If possible, find a doctor that specializes in diseases of the retina. Ensure the doctor knows they are treating someone who has SCD.
Report any loss of vision or increased difficulty seeing to a specialist immediately to prevent further damage to the retina. Signs of this may include difficulty reading, distinguishing shapes or faces, vision blurring, and headaches.

, Adults with severe sickle cell disease can take a medicine called hydroxyurea to help prevent acute chest syndrome. Such medication can only be prescribed by a doctor.A patient who is on bed rest or who has recently had surgery may use an incentive spirometer (i.e. a blow bottle) to monitor their respiratory capacity and thus their chances for acute chest syndrome.

, While there is no way to guarantee a person with SCD will never have a pain episode, creating a healthy, regulated environment does lessen the risk.Drink plenty of water - around 8-10 glasses every day.
Avoid areas that are overly hot or overly cold.
Avoid high altitude places whenever possible, as well as situations with low oxygen, such as mountain climbing or extremely vigorous exercise.
Adults with severe SCD can take hydroxyurea to lessen the number of pain episodes.

, Vaccinations can protect against harmful infections, and are important for both children and adults with SCD.Infants and children with SCD should have all of the normal childhood vaccinations, plus a flu vaccine every year after 6 months of age, a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine at ages 2 and 5, and a meningococcal vaccine (if recommended by a pediatrician).Adults with SCD should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, as well as an annual flu vaccine.
Further transmission of infections may also be prevented by regular hand washing, as well as avoiding common bacteria-carrying animals such as snakes, lizards, and turtles.

Reduce your stress levels.,
Practice breathing exercises.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Watch the amount of caffeine you consume.,
Limit the amount of fat you eat.,
Up your intake of potassium.,
Avoid foods that contain a lot of salt.,
Stop eating grapefruit.",How to Treat Atrial Fibrillation1," While you might think of stress more as a mental issue rather than a physical one, being stressed can actually have a huge impact on your heart. When you get stressed, extra pressure can be put on your heart, leading to atrial fibrillation. There are many ways you can reduce the amount of stress you feel. Some of them include:


Getting enough sleep. When you are tired, things can seem a lot more stressful. Try to aim for six to eight hours of sleep each night.
Coming up with a plan so you feel in control. If work or other activities are stressing you out, take a moment to really think about the problem that is causing you stress. Come up with a plan to handle the problem, and then move forward in a calmer fashion.
Making time to do things that you love. It is really important that you spend some time each day doing things that make you happy. Happiness can be the best cure for stress. Read a chapter of your book, watch a movie, go out with friends, or go on a hike.;
, One of the best ways to help combat atrial fibrillation is to do breathing exercises. The most common and easiest breathing exercise to relieve stress is simply to breathe in for 10 seconds, and then out for 10 seconds. Repeat this process until you feel calm and collected.


A slightly more involved breathing exercise that you can try is called an abdominal breathing technique. To do this, place one hand on your belly and the other hand on your chest. Breathe in through your nose, making sure that your diaphragm (right above your belly) expands, rather than your chest; an expanding diaphragm means that you are breathing deeply, rather than breathing shallowly in your chest. Exhale slowly and repeat., Alcohol is one of the main triggers for atrial fibrillation, especially if you have had this condition before. Some studies show that alcohol can create changes in your heart muscle, which could lead to atrial fibrillation.Because of this, its best to cut alcohol out of your diet. While one glass of champagne is generally considered okay, binge drinking must be avoided at all costs because such an increase in alcohol concentration in your body can lead to an episode.

, While researchers are still looking for evidence explaining why caffeine affects atrial fibrillation, many people with the condition comment that caffeine increases their symptoms.Its generally best to avoid really caffeinated drinks, like espresso or Red Bull. However, one cup of coffee or tea a day will likely not have much of an impact on you.

, A high-fat diet, which generally go hand-in-hand with obesity, is one of the major causes of atrial fibrillation. Because of this, its important that you reduce the amount of fatty foods that you eat; you don’t necessarily need to completely cut fatty foods out of your diet, but you should try to eat less of them. You should avoid:


Saturated fat (found in butter, cheese, and animal fat).
Trans fats (found in margarine).
Cholesterol (found in fatty meats like sausages, and in most dairy products).

, Potassium is one of the four most powerful electrolytes that we can consume. It is important to get enough potassium because it helps to control the movement (or contraction) of your heart muscles. Because of this, if you have low potassium levels, it can lead to atrial fibrillation. Some of the best sources of potassium that you can include in your diet are :


Fruits like bananas, apricots, and oranges.
Root veggies like sweet potatoes and beets.
Other foods like tomatoes, squash, avocados, and prunes.

, When you eat things that are super salty, you increase your chances of getting high blood pressure. When you have high blood pressure, you put a lot of extra stress on your heart that can lead to atrial fibrillation. To keep your blood pressure at a healthy level, try to eat things that have less salt in them., While this may sound strange, particularly because grapefruit is delicious and generally healthy, you will have to stop eating grapefruit if you start taking medication for your condition. Grapefruit interferes with the medications doctors prescribe to control atrial fibrillation because it contains a compound called naringenin."
"
Take antiarrhythmic medication.,
Try anticoagulants.,
Consider electrocardio therapy.,
Discuss surgery with your doctor.",How to Treat Atrial Fibrillation2," These drugs are the most commonly prescribed treatment when it comes to atrial fibrillation because the control your heartbeat and get rid of your irregular pulses. This medication changes the amount of electrolytes that are found in your heart in order to control your heart’s beat. There are tons of different kinds of antiarrhythmic medications out there but the two most commonly prescribed kinds include:


Beta-blockers: As the name suggests, this medication blocks the beta receptors (things that control your heart’s activity) in your heart so that your heart rate decreases. Common beta-blockers include metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, and propranolol.
Calcium channel blockers: These drugs act by blocking the calcium channels in the heart muscles. By doing so, these drugs also decrease the heart rate. Diltiazem and verapamil are examples of this group of antiarrhythmic drugs.

, Anticoagulants are also referred to as “blood thinners” and they do just that--thin your blood. When your blood becomes less thick, there is a lot less chance that a blood clot will develop. When you develop atrial fibrillation, your blood isn’t properly pumped out of your heart, meaning that some of the blood gets left behind. The blood that remains in your heart increases your chances of developing a blood clot.Aspirin is the most common form anticoagulant. While you can get it over-the-counter, you should still talk to your doctor before starting to take aspirin when you have atrial fibrillation.
Warfarin is another blood thinner, but this one is prescribed rather than over-the-counter. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of choosing between warfarin and aspirin.

, While this may sound scary, this is actually a very standard way to bring the heart back to a normal, rhythmic beat. During this treatment, pads that conduct electricity would be put on your chest. The doctor would then turn the electricity current up to a low level, essentially shocking your heart into its regular beat., Surgery is the very last treatment option and will only be considered if your condition gets worse after all of the other treatments have been tried. The surgical procedure, which is referred to as the Maze procedure, creates insulation for your heart so that the electricity in your heart runs in a straighter, normal route.


Some doctors may recommend a catheter, or pacemaker, surgery instead of the Maze procedure. If this is the case, you would get a catheter placed in your heart that would regulate your heart’s beat.

Work with your doctor to develop an Asthma Action Plan.,
Get a prescription.,
Use an anti-inflammatory.,
Take a bronchodilator.,
Use allergy medication.,
Consider bronchial thermoplasty.,
Limit exposure to triggers.,
Maintain your overall health.,
Control heartburn and GERD.,
Employ deep breathing.,
Explore herbal remedies.,
Learn your risk factors.,
Recognize signs and symptoms.,
Undergo asthma tests.,
Receive definitive diagnosis.",How to Treat Asthma," You and your doctor should work together to create a plan that describes the use of your asthma medications, your triggers and how to avoid them, as well as what to do when your asthma is flaring.Everyone will have a different action plan as everyone experiences asthma differently.For instance, if the person suffering from asthma is a student, his action plan would include permission to take his medicine at school.The action plan should include emergency phone numbers, a list of triggers to avoid, flare-up symptoms and what to do when they appear, plus how to prepare before exercise so you don't have an attack.;
, Medication is usually the foundation of asthma treatment. Medication prescribed by your doctor can help keep the disease under control and prevent asthma attacks.There are two types of oral and inhaled asthma medication your doctor may prescribe, and most people take both at the same time:


Anti-inflammatories that reduce swelling and mucus in your airways. This can make breathing easier.
Bronchodilators that relax the muscles around your airways to improve breathing rate and the amount of oxygen in your lungs., Oral or inhaled medications that control inflammation can be the most important for a person with asthma. They reduce swelling and mucus in your airways and can help control or prevent asthma symptoms if taken daily.Your doctor might prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, or mometasone.It may take daily use over a longer period of time for these medications to have their full effect and they come with few side effects.Your doctor may prescribe leukotriene modifier such as montelukast, zafirlukast, or zileuton to help prevent and relieve symptoms for up to 24 hours.Use these drugs carefully, however, as they are linked to psychological reactions including agitation and aggression.Fortunately, these reactions are rare.
Your doctor may also give you a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.For severe symptoms not controlled by other methods, your doctor may prescribe short or long courses of oral steroids. These have more possible side effects, so are only used when other treatments aren't effective or when acute symptoms are severe.

, Bronchodilators come as short- or long-term medications. Short-term bronchodilators, which are often called rescue inhalers, relieve or stop symptoms and can help during attacks.Long-term bronchodilators help control symptoms and prevent attacks.For some people, pre-treating with medication before exercise can reduce asthma symptoms caused by exercise.
Your doctor might prescribe a long-acting beta agonist such as salmeterol or formoterol.These can open your airways, but may also increase your risk of a severe asthma attack. You will usually take them with a corticosteroid.You may also use a combination inhaler such as fluticasone-salmeterol, or mometasone-formoterol.Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that can help control acute or new asthma symptoms. Theophylline is a long-acting bronchodilator which is rarely used for asthma anymore except in certain situations.

, Studies have shown that allergy medications can alleviate asthma symptoms, especially if they are a result of allergies.Talk to your doctor about taking allergy meds for asthma.Allergy shots may decrease your body’s reaction to allergens over the long-term.Nasal steroids such as fluticasone may reduce allergy symptoms and thus reduce asthma triggers.
Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine may reduce or relieve your asthma symptoms. Your doctor can prescribe or recommend an antihistamine for you.

, This treatment, which uses heat to limit the ability of airways to tighten, is not widely available. Speak to your doctor about bronchial thermoplasty if you have severe asthma that doesn’t improve with other treatments.Bronchial therapy requires that you undergo three outpatient hospital visits.The treatment heats the insides of your airways, which reduces the amount of smooth muscle that can contract and limit your air intake.The results of bronchial thermoplasty last for up to a year, which means you may need repeat treatments in subsequent years., Asthma is often worse following exposure to environmental factors that trigger symptoms. Limiting or avoiding triggers can minimize your symptoms or prevent attacks.Add avoid exposure to very hot or cold weather. Cover your face if you are out in the cold or wind.
Keep your immunizations up to date, especially a yearly flu shot, to reduce infections that can trigger an asthma attack.
Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke if you have asthma, as smoke is a significant trigger of asthma symptoms.
Use an air conditioner to reduce airborne pollen circulating indoors.
Reduce the dust in your home through daily vacuuming or removing carpeting.
Cover mattress, pillows, and box springs in a dust-proof cover
If you are allergic to pets, keep them out of the house, or at least out of your room.
Clean regularly to remove dust, pet dander, mold spores and pollen.Avoid exposure to pollens or air pollution by limiting the time you spend outside.Reduce psychological stress., Keep yourself healthy with diet, exercise, and regular doctor’s visit to help relieve symptoms of asthma. Conditions like obesity and heart disease may exacerbate or cause asthma.Exercise regularly to strengthen your heart and lungs. This may also help manage your weight.Eat a healthy, balanced, and regular diet. Consuming recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables may even help lung function and reduce asthma symptoms., There is some evidence that heartburn and GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, may damage airways and make asthma worse. Speak to your doctor and treat both conditions, which may help any symptoms of asthma you experience., There is some evidence that using deep breathing exercises in conjunction with medication can help control symptoms and reduce how much medication you need.It can also relax you, which may relieve psychological stress that exacerbates asthma.


Deep breathing helps distribute oxygen in your body. This can reduce your heart rate, normalize your pulse, and relax you, all of which may help control asthma.Inhale and exhale completely through your nose. You may want to breathe to a specific count. For example, you can inhale to a count of four and then exhale for the same number.To optimize your deep breathing, sit upright with your shoulders back. Breathe slowly and evenly, pulling in your belly to expand your lungs and rib cage., Some studies have shown that herbal and natural remedies may help control asthma. Speak to your doctor before using these remedies.Look for products containing black seed, caffeine, choline, and pycnogenol, as these may help relieve asthma symptoms.Mix three parts tincture of lobelia with one part tincture of capsicum. Take twenty drops of this mixture in water to help a severe asthma attack.Eat ginger and turmeric, which may help decrease inflammation., Doctors don’t know what causes asthma, but they are aware that certain factors increase your risk for the disease.Learning whether you are at risk for asthma can help you identify symptoms and get treatment.Risk factors include:Having a blood relative with asthma
Having allergic conditions like atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis
Being overweight
Being a smoker or exposing someone else or yourself to secondhand smoke
Working with or being exposed to exhaust fumes or other pollutants

, Asthma has a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Recognizing potential symptoms have can help you get proper treatment.Some of the symptoms of asthma include:Shortness of breath
Tightness or pain in the chest
Sleeping difficulties
Coughing, especially with exercise, acute attacks, or during the night
Whistling or wheezing sounds when breathing

, If your think you might have asthma, see your doctor. If she thinks you may have asthma, she may order tests after examining you. The following kinds of tests may be the only way to confirm asthma:Spirometry, which examines how much your bronchial tubes narrow and how much air you can exhale after a deep breath.
Peak flow meter tracking, to determine your ability to exhale.Methacholine challenge, which uses an asthma trigger to see if you have asthma.
Nitric oxide testing to measure the amount of nitric oxide in your breath, which can confirm asthma.Scans like X-ray, CT, or and MRI to look at the tissues of your lungs and nose cavities that can make asthma worse.
Allergy tests
Sputum eosinophils, to look for the presence of certain types of white blood cell called eosinophils., Depending on the results of your tests, your doctor may confirm a diagnosis of asthma. Speak to her about the best treatment for your specific case.

Put on compression stockings.,
Elevate your legs.,
Take NSAIDs to reduce swelling.,
Consider other medications.,
Use natural remedies for reducing swelling.",How to Treat a Swollen Vein1," One way to get relief from swollen veins is to put on compression stockings. These are tight-fitting stockings that put pressure on your legs to help push blood through your veins, reducing vessel diameter and improving blood flow. There are two types of compression stockings you can get without a doctor’s prescription, or you can get the strongest kind by talking to your doctor.Follow manufacturer recommendations regarding when and how long to wear compression stockings. Make sure to check your skin condition underneath the stockings multiple times each day. Advanced age, diabetes, nerve damage, and other conditions can place an individual at greater risk for skin damage associated with prolonged pressure and skin infections. The stockings should be the appropriate size for the person using them and not too tight.
Support pantyhose. These are merely tight stockings, which offer the least amount of pressure. They will provide pressure to your entire leg, not a particular part, but can be helpful if the swelling isn’t serious.
Over-the-counter (OTC) gradient compression hose. These are sold in medical supply and drugstores, and will provide more targeted pressure. Look for products labelled “gradient” or “graduated.”
By talking to a doctor, you can get prescription stockings. These are the stockings that give the most pressure to your legs. They can be targeted to different parts of your legs to make sure you get pressure where you need it most. Make sure you wear them as often as directed. If you do get a prescription, don’t stop wearing them without consulting your doctor.;
, To get blood flowing out of your legs and back towards your heart, lie down and raise them above your heart. Elevate your legs at least 15 minutes, three to four times a day.:


Some good ways to elevate your legs include putting pillows under your legs while you lie in bed, lying on a couch with your legs elevated on pillows on a chair in front of you, or leaning back in a reclining chair that will elevate your legs above your heart.
Do not elevate your legs more than six times a day, as it puts a good deal of pressure on your vein’s walls.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce swelling in your veins. NSAIDs provide relief by blocking the release of prostaglandins, which cause swelling and pain. It is important to take NSAIDs on a full stomach to prevent tummy aches and hyperacidity.Do not start taking NSAIDs without consulting your doctor first. He can recommend dosage amounts to provide the best relief while not overdoing it. Use of NSAIDs for more than two weeks may cause the side effect of stomach or intestine ulcers.
Common NSAIDs include aspirin, Ibuprofen (sold commercially as Advil or Nuprin), Naproxen (Aleve), and Ketoprofen (Orudis KT).

, If you are suffering from thrombophlebitis, you may need medication that thins the blood or dissolves clots. You will need a prescription for these drugs, so talk to your doctor about the best options for you.Blood-thinning medications will prevent your blood from clotting, creating better flow in your veins. Common blood-thinners include heparin or fondaparinux (sold as Arixtra), warfarin (Coumadin) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
Clot-dissolving medications deal with clots that already exist, and are usually used for more extensive and serious cases. These include alteplase (Activase), and will dissolve blood clots currently in your veins.

, If you are uncomfortable, or unable, to take NSAIDs, consider some natural remedies to reduce the swelling. You should talk to your doctor about using these treatments as well, making sure that your dosage is right and that they don't interact with other medications you may be taking.Licorice root extracts can be taken internally or externally. Make sure the form you take it in is diluted properly. Avoid using if you have heart disease, hormone-sensitive cancers (breast, ovarian, uterine, or prostate), high blood pressure, diabetes, disease of the liver or kidney, low potassium, erectile dysfunction, or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.Apply marigold herbs to the affected area before putting on compression, either a cloth or your stockings.
Epsom salt baths can also reduce swelling. Add one to two cups of salt to bath water and let it dissolve before soaking in it. You don’t need to wash yourself with it, just sit and relax.Take at least one bath per week, or soak your feet in lukewarm water with Epsom salts daily.

Do leg stretches after sitting for a long time.,
Stretch your chest a couple times a day.,
Take advantage of any breaks that come during the day.",How to Treat a Swollen Vein2," Whether you are working at a desk, sitting in a car, riding in an airplane, or spending a lot of your day sitting down at home, make sure you stretch a few times a day. Sitting all day can cause your veins to become swollen because of decreased blood circulation. There are several good stretches you can do, even while sitting down.Sit with your legs straight out in front of you under your desk with only your heels touching the ground.
Curl your toes so that they are pointing towards you and hold this position for 30 seconds. You should feel a stretch in your calf muscles, however, do not stretch so much that you feel pain.
Point your toes away from you and hold this position for 30 seconds. You will feel a stretch in the front leg but make sure that there is no feeling of pain.

, Your legs are not the only thing that need to be stretched. This chest stretch helps your chest muscles and strengthens your back muscles to combat poor posture. Having good posture helps to keep your blood flowing smoothly throughout your body.


Sit up tall in your chair. Imagine that there are strings from the ceiling that are pulling your chest upward. Interlock your fingers, and turn your palms toward the ceiling. Lift up your chin, tilt your head back, and gaze at the ceiling. Take a deep breath in this position, exhale, and release., Whether you are sitting at your desk for work, or in the car for a long ride, look for chances to get up from sitting. If one isn’t coming up, make some time for a break to happen.


While in the car, use trips to the gas station, bathroom breaks, even sightseeing to get up and stretch for a bit. These can work even if you aren’t actually filling up the tank or using the bathroom. Just a little break from sitting can be helpful for the veins in your legs.
When you are at work, look for excuses to get up during the day. Rather than sending an email, walk to the person’s desk or office to have a conversation in person. When you go to lunch, walk somewhere for food instead of just sitting at your desk.This can be tough when flying, but for long flights consider getting up and walking to the back of the plane and back to your seat. Maybe get up and go to the bathroom once during the flight as well.

Know the symptoms of swollen veins.,
Avoid standing for long periods.,
Avoid sitting with your legs crossed at the level of your knees.,
Exercise.,
Lose some weight.,
Quit smoking.",How to Treat a Swollen Vein3," If you are suffering from these symptoms, this can be a sign you should start treatment and maybe contact a doctor. The sooner you take action, the quicker you can get relief. Symptoms of swollen veins only occur in the area where the swollen vein exists.Common symptoms include fullness, heaviness, aching, and pain in the legs; mild swelling of feet or ankles; and itching. You will probably also see visible swollen veins, particularly in your legs.
More severe symptoms include leg swelling, leg or calf pain after sitting or standing for long periods; color changes to the skin of the legs or ankles; dry, irritated, and scaly skin that cracks easily; skin sores that don’t heal easily; and thickening and hardening of the skin in your legs and ankles.

, This causes strain on your legs, which can lead to pain and poor blood flow. Find ways to take a break and sit down for a while, breaking up the time when you are standing.When you sit, make sure you avoid crossing your legs. Keep them raised when possible, which will let the blood flow away from them. If possible, probably while lying down, raise your legs above your heart level to further reduce blood flow.

, Sitting in this position will lead to a restriction of your blood flow. Your restricted blood flow can cause the lower veins to dilate (because the venous drainage to the heart is restricted., Look for workouts that helps to stimulate your legs muscles. The contraction of skeletal muscle in the legs will help blood flow back into your heart and through the rest of your body, putting less pressure on the veins in your legs.Even just flexing your foot up and down when sedentary can help propel blood through the veins of your legs.Exercises that are recommended for people dealing with this condition include walking, jogging, and swimming. Swimming, in particular, is good because it keeps your body horizontal, which means that your blood is less likely to accumulate in your legs and cause your veins to become swollen.

, If you are overweight, you should consider losing some weight to help treat your swollen veins. When you are overweight, more pressure is put on your lower body, including your legs and feet. This can cause more blood to go to that area, which can lead to swollen veins.To best lose weight, find ways to control your diet. Limit portion sizes and get a good balance of foods. Look for lean proteins, low-fat dairy, whole grain cereals and fibers, healthy oils, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid eating sweets, fried or processed meals, and foods high in trans or hydrogenated fats.Talk to a doctor about your weight loss goals. She can tell you if they are realistic or manageable, and can provide additional guidance to help you reach them. Your doctor can also help you create a diet plan that takes into account any medications you are taking.

, Aside from being generally unhealthy for you, smoking can also increase pressure in your veins. Some substances in cigarette smoke have very negative effects on your blood vessels, including the venous walls. It is better to stop smoking so that your veins will not become too dilated, leading to swelling."

Talk to your doctor about sclerotherapy.,
Consider laser therapy.,
Learn more about ablation.,
Discuss getting an ambulatory phlebectomy.,
Talk to your doctor about vein stripping.",How to Treat a Swollen Vein4," This is a relatively painless procedure that injects a liquid chemical or saline solution into your veins to close them off, causing them to disappear. These are good for smaller varicose or spider veins. It may take several treatments, done every four to six weeks. After treatment, your legs will probably be wrapped with elastic bandaging to decrease swelling.There is also a form of the treatment called microsclerotherapy, which targets spider veins. It uses a very fine needle to inject the liquid chemical into the veins.

, This procedure is generally only used for small varicose veins. A laser will be applied to your skin near the swollen vein. It generates energy to heat the venous tissue, destroying all blood elements nearby. After that, the swollen vein will be obstructed, closed, and, after some time, reabsorbed by your body., Venous ablation uses intense heat to treat your veins, and can be performed either using radio-frequency or laser technology energy. Your doctor will puncture the vein, thread a catheter into the vein up to your groin, then send heat through it. This heat will close off and destroy the vein, and it will disappear over time., This is a surgical procedure in which the doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small veins. He will then use small hooks to pull the vein out of your leg. This procedure is good for spider veins and other small veins.In normal cases, this is a same-day surgery. The doctor will only numb the area around the vein, so you will remain awake during the procedure. You may experience some slight bruising.
Phlebectomy procedures may be done along with other procedures, including ablation. Your doctor will know if it is useful to do the treatments together., This is an invasive procedure for dealing with problem veins, and is usually done only for severe cases of varicose veins. The doctor will make small cuts in your skin, and tie off and remove the veins from your leg. You will be put under anesthesia during the procedure, and should recover fully in one to four weeks.Even though you are removing veins, this surgery won’t affect your blood circulation. Additional veins deeper in your leg will deal with the blood, and the circulation in your leg should be fine.

Figure out if you have a boil.,
Avoid squeezing or lancing a boil.,
Place a warm compress on the boil.,
Soak in a lukewarm bath.,
Keep the affected area clean.,
Utilize colloidal silver on the boil or internally.,
Apply tea tree oil to the boil.,
Employ turmeric powder internally or topically.,
Fasten a castor oil compress to the boil.,
Wear loose and smooth clothing.,
Try a saltwater solution.",How to Treat Boils at Home1," Boils can happen for a number of reasons, but are usually caused by a Staphylococcus aureus bacteria infection on your skin.Figuring out if you have a boil can help you most effectively decide on the right treatment for you at home.


A boil may present itself as an inflamed area with pain that starts the size of a pea and increases as it fills with pus. There may be a tiny, pimple-like bump or tip on the boil.;
, You may want to squeeze or lance the boil, but avoid the temptation to remove it this way. Picking at and touching your skin can spread bacteria and may cause further infection.Picking or touching your boil may also cause further irritation and swelling., Place a warm to hot compress on the boil and surrounding skin. This can help rupture and drain a boil more quickly, and may also reduce the pain.Heat a glass of water to a comfortable, warm to hot temperature that won’t burn your skin. Dip a soft cloth or washcloth in the water and apply it to the affected area. Do this procedure several times a day.Gentle, circular rubbing may help release rupture the roil. It’s not unusual to see a small amount of pus or blood if you do this., Take a short bath in lukewarm water.If you feel that the boil is about to burst, take a warm shower instead.


Consider sprinkling the water with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal, all of which may help calm your skin and treat the boil.Stay in the bathtub for only 10 – 15 minutes and repeat as necessary or as you wish.

, Bacteria can inflame and infect the boil even more. Keeping anything that comes into contact with the boil clean will inhibit the growth of infection-causing bacteria.In particular, avoid letting anyone else touch the area, as they may have different or more resistant bacteria that can worsen the infection.


Wash the area with a mild antibacterial soap. After you have applied the washcloth and the boil starts to drain, clean the area with a mild, antibacterial soap. Dry it with a towel by dabbing the area.Wash your hands thoroughly after touching or treating the boil.Wash anything that comes into contact with your boil such as clothing, sheets, towels, and even the washcloth you use as a compress., Colloidal silver is a natural antibiotic. Ingest it internally or use it topically to treat your boil.Mix one tablespoon of colloidal silver with one 8oz. glass of water and drink three times a day to help heal the boil.You can apply colloidal silver to your boil using a bandage or by spraying it on in a mixture of water. It is painless and won’t hurt your sensitive skin like many other treatments may.You can purchase colloidal silver for topical or internal use at pharmacies and medical supply stores.

, Use a bit of tea tree oil on your boil and the surrounding skin. This antiseptic, antibiotic, and antifungal is a centuries-old treatment, though there is little scientific evidence of its efficacy.There is a high incidence of sensitivity to tea tree oil. It is always a good idea to first do a patch test on an area that is not affected.
Mix a 1-1 solution of tea tree oil and water. Use diluted tea tree oil twice daily on the affected area., Turmeric is a spice that has antiseptic and antibiotic properties. You can either ingest turmeric powder or make a paste, which may help dissolve and heal the boil in as little as three days.You can mix one teaspoon of turmeric powder with one glass of warm water three times a day.You can also purchase turmeric capsules and take at least 450mg each day.You can make a paste of turmeric powder and place it directly on the boil. Cover it with a piece of gauze to help it heal and prevent it from staining your clothes., Moisten a cotton ball with some castor oil and place it directly on the boil. Secure the cotton ball with gauze or a band-aid. This may help to drain the boil and help it heal.You can get castor oil and many pharmacies, grocery stores, and health food stores.

, Tight fitting clothing can irritate your skin and make a boil worse. Wear loose, smooth, and light clothing to allow your skin to breathe and avoid irritating the boil.Smooth-textured clothing such as cotton or merino wool can keep your skin from getting irritated and can prevent excess sweating that may irritate the boil.

, Saline solution, which is water mixed with salt, may help draw out pus and dry out a boil. Hold a washcloth soaked in saline on the boil as after as necessary after it pops.Only use the saline solution once your boil has popped.Use a saline solution purchased from a pharmacy. This is recommended over attempting to make your own — it is easy to oversaturate the saline and create a very drying solution.
If you do want to make your own, mix one teaspoon of salt for every cup of hot water.
Dip a washcloth in the mixture and place it on the boil. Repeat the procedure as necessary."

Dab benzoyl peroxide on the boil.,
Bandage the boil.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat Boils at Home2," Boils can cause pain that ranges from mild to severe. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever to help alleviate associated pain and possible swelling.


Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may also help alleviate some of the swelling associated with the procedure.

, Wash the boil and surrounding area with a medicated, germ killing cleanser. This may not only help rupture and drain the boil, but may also keep infection from spreading.You can get antiseptic washes at most pharmacies and health supply stores.

, Apply an antibacterial ointment up to twice per day and cover the surface with a bandage. This can help to kill any bacteria in the boil or on the affected area.You can use an antibiotic ointment such as bacitracin, neomycin, polymyxin B, or a combination. Many brands will put the three into one product and call it “triple antibiotic ointment.”Use the ointment as indicated on the packaging.
Some people have allergies to antibiotic ointment, particularly bacitracin. Do a patch trial on an unaffected area of skin before using antibiotic ointment.
You can purchase antibiotic ointments and creams at most pharmacies and some grocery stores.

, Over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide creams, which are usually used for acne, may help dry out a boil. Dab on a small amount of this topical antiseptic twice a day to help reduce the boil.You can purchase benzoyl peroxide creams at most pharmacies, some health supply stores and even some grocery stores.

, Loosely cover the boil with a sterile gauze pad or bandage when it begins draining.This can help keep the area dry, clean, and prevent infection from spreading.Replace the gauze or bandage any time it gets moist.You can purchase sterile gauze and bandages at any pharmacy, health supply store, and some grocery stores.

, If home treatment doesn’t heal a boil or if it returns, make an appointment with your doctor. This can help ensure you don’t have a serious infection and may help prevent further boils.Be aware of MRSA, a potentially life-threatening form of staph that is resistant to antibiotics.MRSA can look like a common staph infection, so it is important to see your doctor if symptoms don't improve or you have been in contact with someone with MRSA or who has a chronic illness.
If your boil lasts longer than two weeks, make sure to see a doctor.If you have a boil on your spine or the middle of your face, see your doctor as soon as possible.If you have or develop a fever with a boil, consult a physician. This may be a sign of larger infection or one that has spread.Your doctor may need to lance your boil if it doesn’t rupture on its own or it is very serious."

If you have any of these symptoms, it’s best to see a health care professional to get a diagnosis.;
, Adrenal fatigue is caused when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones your body needs to function properly. While it can present with the above-mentioned symptoms, many people will show no symptoms at all.


Adrenal fatigue is usually associated with intense or prolonged stress. But the syndrome can also appear as a result of acute or chronic infections, influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia.As the name suggests, the most prominent symptom of the syndrome is fatigue. You may not even notice that you have adrenal fatigue, but simply feel a general sense of being unwell or fatigue., While there is a wealth of information available on the internet about adrenal fatigue, it is a controversial diagnosis. Not recognized as an actual condition by medical doctors, most proponents of adrenal fatigue are holistic and alternative medicine practitioners.Medical doctors, including those at renowned institutions such as the Mayo Clinic, don’t recognize adrenal fatigue as an illness; however, they do support the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency or Addison’s Disease to denote inadequate production of one or more of the hormones essential to life that the adrenal glands produce.The symptoms of Addison’s Disease are similar to adrenal fatigue and include: fatigue, body aches, unexplained weight loss, low blood pressure, lightheadedness, loss of body hair, and skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation).Proponents of adrenal fatigue maintain that the syndrome is a mild form of adrenal insufficiency caused by chronic stress. They theorize that the adrenal glands are unable to handle constant stress and thus can't produce enough of the hormones an individual needs to feel well. According to their theory, blood tests cannot detect this minute change in adrenal function, but the body can.You may notice that many sites with information about adrenal fatigue will not give you complete information, but instead will prompt you to buy books and products.

, If you have the symptoms of adrenal dysfunction and are concerned that you may have the syndrome, get tested by a medical professional. You should also consider getting tested for Addison’s Disease and other illnesses, since the symptoms of adrenal function overlap with them.


Remember that a medical doctor may not recognize your concern about adrenal fatigue and may test you for Addison’s Disease or another illness.
Adrenal dysfunction can be tested by various methods. Your doctor or health care professional may prescribe blood tests to analyze levels of the following hormones secreted by your adrenal glands and thyroid: cortisol (which controls stress), ACTH, FT4, FT3, and total thyroxine.Two additional tests that you or a health professional may administer for adrenal fatigue are the iris contraction test and postural low blood pressure test.The iris contraction test measures how long the iris can contract in response to repeated exposure to dark light. Go into the dark bathroom and allow your pupils to adjust to the lack of light, then shine the light from a penlight or flashlight into your eye. You will notice the pupil contract (or get smaller); however, someone with adrenal fatigue’s irises will not be remain contracted for a prolonged period of time, and after about 30 seconds they will begin to dilate, despite shining the light on them.Postural low blood pressure measures how quickly blood pressure rises when a person stands up. Someone suffering from adrenal fatigue will see no change in their blood pressure or even a slight fall, which is also called orthostatic hypotension.To test this, lie down for five minutes and have someone measure your blood pressure. Then stand up and, after one to three minutes, have the person take another reading. Not the change, if any, in your blood pressure readings.

, Once you have a diagnosis for adrenal dysfunction, talk to your health professional about your treatment options and the recovery time. If you’ve diagnosed yourself, you may want to do some additional research on how to treat the syndrome.


The treatment options for adrenal fatigue range from changing diet and exercise, to reducing stress, and taking herbal or hormonal supplements.
Estimates for the recovery period from adrenal fatigue range from about six to about eighteen months. Some individuals may need less time, while others need more, depending of the severity of the syndrome.There are some adrenal fatigue treatment programs online including Dr. Wilson’s Adrenal Fatigue Supplement Program.

, Before you start any treatment program for adrenal fatigue, consult with your doctor. Talking to your doctor will help ensure that your treatment plan will not harm your health.

, Making some simple changes to your diet can optimize your health and help combat the symptoms of adrenal fatigue. From eating bone broth to avoiding caffeine, these suggestions will help you to recover faster.


Avoid foods to which you are sensitive or allergic. These foods prevent the body absorbing vital nutrients and cause inflammation that can spur a host of problems including sleep disorders.Eat a healthy breakfast to get your body off on the right food and help stabilize your blood sugar and keep your body from stressing because it doesn’t have enough sustenance to function.Good food choices for breakfast include steel cut oats with fruit, Greek yogurt, eggs, and whole wheat toast.
Eat less sugar to help control your cortisol levels. Cortisol regulates excess sugar so consuming less means that you’re less likely to overstimulate your adrenal glands. Avoid foods like cookies, cakes, and fruit juices.Avoid caffeine, which stimulates your adrenal glands to produce adrenaline and cortisol, which put your body into a state of stress.Try eating superfoods such as bone broth and seaweed, which are very high in nutrients and can reduce inflammation., Since many people with adrenal fatigue are in pain or are simply too tired to do vigorous exercise, adding a gentle exercise program to your treatment plan can help alleviate the symptoms of adrenal fatigue. Activities such as walking or swimming will also decrease stress, which in turn helps stabilize your cortisol levels.Some examples of good exercise options are walking, swimming, yoga, and tai chi.
If you are not suffering from severe adrenal fatigue, you can jog or run, or even lift light weights.An added benefit of exercise is that it will help you sleep better., One of the underlying causes of adrenal fatigue is stress and its related hormone of cortisol. Reducing the stress in your life through activities such as meditation and unplugging from electronics will help your body recover from adrenal fatigue.


Try meditation and pranayama, or deep breathing. These exercises help reduce stress and normalize our the levels of the hormones adrenaline and cortisol.These activities aid circulation and toxin elimination as well as increasing our energy levels through oxygen saturation.In today’s world, we are inundated with emails, text messages, and other forms of ambient knowledge. Unplugging from your electronic devices is another good way to help decrease your stress levels.
Exercise will also help decrease stress and cortisol.

, Although adrenal fatigue may cause a deficiency in hormones, it may also cause a deficiency in vital nutrients the body needs. Taking medications and supplements can help alleviate the symptoms of adrenal fatigue and put you on the path to recovery.


Know that any medications and supplements should be taken only after consulting with a health care professional so that you do not endanger your health.

, People with adrenal fatigue are often lacking in several vitamins and minerals. Consider taking a multivitamin or specific vitamins to help replenish the levels in your blood.You may want to take the following vitamin supplements if you do not want to take a multivitamin: Vitamins B5, B6, and B12.These specific B vitamins are important role to cell metabolism and will boost your energy level.Although there are studies on the benefits of the B vitamins with certain conditions, there is no evidence to support that taking the B vitamins will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is directly involved in the production of cortisol in your adrenal glands as well as in the recovery of your adrenals. Vitamin C will also help boost your immunity.Although there are studies on the benefits of Vitamin C for the adrenal glands, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.Magnesium will help maintain energy flow and fight symptoms like fatigue and depression. Start with 400mg because taking too much magnesium can cause digestive problems.One older study examines the relationship between adrenal insufficiency and magnesium.However, there is no direct evidence that taking the supplement will alleviate your adrenal fatigue., There are also several herbal supplement you can take that might help adrenal fatigue, including licorice root, Siberian ginseng, Rhodiola Rosea, and Maca root.Remember the herbal supplements are unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, so their claims are often not proven with research.
Licorice root is used to stimulate hormone production, maintain energy levels and increase endurance by helping your cortisol to circulate in your system for a longer period of time. Licorice root can elevate blood pressure, so avoid it if you have high blood pressure.Although there are studies on the medical uses of licorice root, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.Siberian ginseng is used to improve stamina and mental awareness, and boost energy levels. Siberian ginseng can elevate blood pressure, so avoid it if you have high blood pressure.Although there are a few studies on the medical uses of Siberian ginseng, including for stamina and mental awareness, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue. In addition, the results of these studies was often contradictory.Rhodiola rosea can help with muscle tension, poor circulation, depression, and fatigue by increasing circulation and cortisol production.Although there are studies on the medical uses of Rhodiola for depression, stress, and fatigue, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate adrenal fatigue.Maca root can help cortisol blood sugar regulation as well as aiding your body to get the most out of its low levels of hormones.There isn’t enough research or information to know how it might work, or if it will alleviate adrenal fatigue., Hormone replacement is another option to help treat adrenal fatigue. You’ll need a prescription from your health care professional for any hormones you take, including cortisol, DHEA, pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and adrenal extract.You’ll have to consult with your doctor if you are considering hormone replacement because this type of therapy requires prescription medication.
Your doctor will likely prescribe a blood test to establish your baseline hormone levels in order to best figure out which hormone replacements you should take.Although hormone replacement may help with adrenal fatigue, there is almost no research on it as a therapy for the syndrome. It is thus important that if you choose this method, that you do it only under a doctor’s supervision.Cortisol has been long used to treat for Addison’s Disease, or adrenal insufficiency.But cortisol can have significant side effects including obesity, muscle weakness, diabetes, and thin skin, so use with care.Because of these side effects, most doctors are reluctant to prescribe corticosteroids for a long period of time.
Taking DHEA can reinvigorate sex drive and some of the other symptoms of well-being that adrenal fatigue disrupts. If you are taking DHEA, get levels of the hormone tested regularly so that you’re not getting too much.Pregnenolone is directly involved with sex and stress hormones and taking it may help reduce the symptoms of adrenal fatigue.Testosterone can help improve symptoms of adrenal fatigue related to general well-being, libido, endurance, and mood. It may also improve overall quality of life.Progesterone may help with lower energy levels, irritability and depression, as well as weight gain.Adrenal glandular extracts may help with fatigue and stress. If you decide to take this hormone replacement, make sure that it comes from a quality, organic source."

Rest the muscle.,
Ice the area.,
Compress the muscle.,
Elevate the injured limb.,
Avoid HARM.,
Eat well to help heal a torn muscle.",How to Treat a Torn Muscle1," For either a first or second degree injury, medical care is not typically needed. You can treat these injuries with RICE, a mnemonic for the steps treatment. Step one is to rest the injured area.Take a break from exercising until you can move the muscle without pain. Do not participate in any sports until you are feeling stronger. This should not be any longer than two weeks. If significant pain persists beyond that, make an appointment with your physician.
You should still be able to walk and/or move your arms. If you cannot do this, then your tear may be severe. You should see your healthcare provider.;
, Apply ice, either in the form of a bag of frozen peas or crushed/cubed ice in a protective plastic wrapping. Wrap the ice pack in a cloth or thin towel before you use it. Apply the ice to the affected area for 15 to 20 minutes every two hours for the first two days after the injury.The ice will decrease the internal bleeding (hematoma), swelling, inflammation, and discomfort.

, You can also wrap the injured area with an ace bandage to protect the area for the first 48 to 72 hours. Be sure to wrap it snugly, but not too tight.To wrap the affected area, start wrapping at the furthest point from your heart and move inwards towards your body. For example, if your injury is in your bicep, then start wrapping near your elbow and move upwards towards your armpit. If your injury is in the lower part of your calf, then start wrapping your leg near your ankle and move upwards towards your knee.
Be sure you can still fit two fingers between your skin and the wrap. Remove the wrap if you notice any signs of decreased circulation, such as numbness, tingling, or paleness in the area.
Compression will also serve to protect the area from re-injury.

, You can also elevate the injured limb above your heart to help reduce the swelling. Place the limb up on some pillows and lay down. Make sure that you are in a comfortable position.If you can't get the injury above your heart, try to at least keep it parallel to the ground.
If you are still feeling a great deal of throbbing, try raising the limb higher.

, For the first 72 hours after you tear a muscle, it is important to avoid doing certain things that can make your injury worse. The activities you should avoid can be represented by the acronym HARM, which stands for:Heat. Don’t use a heating pad or take a hot bath.

Alcohol. Don’t drink alcohol because this can increase the bleeding and swelling. It may also cause your injury to take longer to heal.

Running. Don’t run or do any other strenuous activities that might worsen your injury.

Massage. Don’t get a massage or massage the injured area because this can cause more bleeding and swelling.

, Eat foods that contain a lot of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, antioxidants, and protein to speed up the healing process. Some foods that would help include: citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, blueberries, chicken, walnuts, and many more."

Take acetaminophen for the first two days.,
Take an anti-inflammatory medication for a short time period.,
Ask your doctor about prescription pain-relief creams.,
Request a prescription pain-reliever for severe pain.",How to Treat a Torn Muscle2," Acetaminophen is recommended for the first two days after you tear a muscle because it is less likely to increase bleeding.Then, you can switch to an NSAID, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, after the first two days.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can help to rehabilitate your torn muscle. Take recommended doses of Ibuprofen or Aspirin for 3-7 days after the injury. Don’t take NSAIDs for a longer time period than this or you may suffer from long term side effects such as upset stomach.NSAID medications stop pain, but also may stop a phase of chemical reactions that are important in long-term healing.Many doctors recommend their use starting 48 hours after the injury.
Take ibuprofen or naproxen with food and a glass of water to avoid gastric complications such as ulcers. Be careful if you have asthma, as anti-inflammatory drugs can make an asthma attack more likely., You can get prescription NSAID creams to rub onto the skin over the torn muscle. These creams work locally to reduce pain and swelling in the muscle.Apply the cream to the affected area only and use the medicine as directed by your physician.
Make sure that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream to the affected area.

, If your injury is severe, then you may experience severe pain as well. In this case, your doctor may prescribe a pain reliever, such as codeine.Keep in mind that these medications can be habit-forming and they are much stronger than over-the-counter medicines. Follow your doctor’s instructions for dosage carefully.

Get a diagnosis.,
Ask about physical therapy.,
See a doctor to rule out other conditions.,
Seek medical attention for a third degree tear.,
Discuss surgical treatment options for ruptures and tears.,
Follow up with your physician.",How to Treat a Torn Muscle3," Many minor tears will heal on their own with the help of self-care measure. However, it is difficult to determine the extent of your injury without seeing a doctor. If you are in pain, having difficulty using the affected limb, or experiencing excessive bruising and swelling, then you may want to see a doctor for a diagnosis.


A doctor can perform a physical exam of your injury and order imaging tests, such as an X-ray and an MRI. These tests can help your doctor to rule out broken bones and to find out how badly the muscle has been torn.Depending on the severity of your injury, your doctor may provide you with a brace or splint to keep the affected limb immobilized as it heals., Physical therapy may also be necessary if you have sustained a severe muscle tear. Doing physical therapy can help to ensure that the muscle will heal correctly and that you will regain full use of it.During your physical therapy session, you will learn about and perform exercises as directed by your physical therapist. These exercises will help to build strength in a safe way and increase your range of motion.

, Some conditions are related to muscle tears, but are much more serious. If you believe you have one of these conditions, then you will need to seek immediate medical care.



Compartment syndrome. If you experience severe pain with numbness and tingling, a pale limb, and a feeling of tightness, seek immediate medical attention.Compartment syndrome is an orthopedic emergency that requires surgical treatment within hours. Otherwise, you may need to have the limb removed. If you have any of these symptoms it is important you tell your doctor right away. The blood from a tear can place internal pressure on blood vessels and nerves. This cuts off circulation as the pressure builds.

Achilles tendon rupture. The Achilles tendon is located at the back of your ankle and calf.It can be ruptured by vigorous exercise, especially in men over 30. If you experience pain along the back of your foot, especially when stretching your ankle, you may have a ruptured Achilles tendon. The condition requires complete immobilization and casting in flexion.

, If you have torn your muscle completely, then you will not be able to move the affected limb. You will need to seek treatment from a qualified healthcare professional as soon as possible.The treatment and recovery time will vary based on the severity and location of the tear. For example, for a complete bicep tear, you'll need surgery with a recovery period of four to six months. Partial tears usually heal within three to six weeks.Depending on the type of tear, you may need to see an orthopedist or other specialist.

, In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a ruptured muscle or torn ligament.Ask your doctor about your options if he or she recommends surgery for your injury.


The need for surgery to repair a torn muscle is rare, and it may only be recommended if you are a sports professional because your performance may not return to normal without surgery.

, Your doctor will likely want to see you again in the near future for a follow-up visit. This is to ensure that your injury is healing normally. Make sure that you attend this follow-up visit.Inform your doctor right away if your injury worsens or if it does not seem to be improving.

, Icing the area reduces swelling and helps ease the pain. Fill a large food storage bag with ice cubes. Wrap it in a thin towel, to protect your skin from getting damaged by direct ice. Hold the ice pack to your sore area for 20 minutes at a time several times a day until the swelling has gone down.A bag of frozen peas or another vegetable also works well as an ice pack.
Avoid using heat, which won't reduce inflammation caused by a pulled muscle.

, Wrapping the site of the pulled muscle can reduce inflammation and provide support to prevent further injury. Use an ace bandage to loosely wrap your arm or leg.


Don't wrap the area too tightly, or you might inhibit circulation.If you don't have an ace bandage, cut an old pillowcase into one long strip and use it to compress the area.

, Raising the inflamed area can help the swelling go down and provide it with the proper rest it needs to heal.


If you pulled a muscle in your leg, rest it on an ottoman or chair while you're sitting.
If you pulled a muscle in your arm, you can elevate it using a sling.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen reduce pain and help you move around more easily with a pulled muscle. Be sure to take no more than the recommended dosage, and never give aspirin to children.

, Resting the muscles and using ice packs should take care of a pulled muscle within a few days. If you experience severe pain that won't dissipate, see a doctor. You may have a severe injury that needs medical attention.


If your doctor determines your injury needs extra care, you may be given a pair of crutches or a sling so that the pulled muscle can rest. Prescription-strength painkillers may also be administered.
In rare cases, a pulled muscle requires physical therapy or surgical care.

, Sometimes muscle pain is related to something besides overexertion.You may think you pulled a muscle during a physical activity, but if you experience these other symptoms at the same time, make an appointment to see a doctor:


Signs of infection, like itchiness and red, raised skin.
Bite marks in the area of soreness.
Poor circulation or numbness in the area where the muscle pain is felt.

,
You have shortness of breath or dizziness.
You have a stiff neck and a fever.

, Pulled muscles happen when your muscles get overstrained, which can often occur as a result of exerting yourself before you've properly warmed up. Take the time to stretch and get your muscles warmed up before you participate in a physical activity.


If you enjoy running, take a light jog before doing sprints or faster running.
If you play a team sport, jog, play catch, or do light calisthenics before diving into the game.

, Incorporating weightlifting and other strength training into your exercise routine can help prevent the chance that you'll pull a muscle during an activity. Use free weights at home or work out in the weight room at the gym to build a solid, strong core and keep your muscles limber.

, It's easy to get caught up in the moment when you're doing a physical activity and force yourself to keep going even when the pain in your leg or arm indicates you should stop. Remember that putting more strain on a pulled muscle will only make things worse. If you cause a deeper tear, you may have to sit out for an entire season instead of just one game.

Get more iron.,
Avoid iron-decreasing foods.,
Ingest more vitamin B12.,
Consume more folate.,
Take more vitamin C. To make healthy RBCs to keep up your blood supply, your body needs vitamin C. Adults over 19 should get 85 mg of vitamin C per day.,
Make sure you get enough.,
Take supplements.,
Avoid getting too much.,
Get retested.",How to Treat Anemia Naturally1," If you have anemia caused by an iron deficiency, you need to get more iron in your diet. Men and non-menstruating women need about 10 mg of iron a day. Menstruating or nursing mothers should have 15 mg of iron a day, which pregnant women need 30 mg. Eat at least two to three servings of iron rich foods every day to help get this dosage of iron. Iron rich foods include:


Red meat, liver, poultry, pork, and fish
Spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, beet greens, all different kinds of lettuce, broccoli, and kale
Tofu, soy milk, and other soy products
Legumes, such as peas, white beans, red beans, baked bean, chickpeas, and soybeans
Dried fruits, such as raisins, apricots, and prunes
Prune juice
Whole grain cereals and breads that have been iron-fortified;
, Certain foods can cause your body to decrease its iron absorption. If you are trying to up your iron intake, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with your meals because they lower the amount of iron you absorb. You should also not take an iron supplement with your meals.


Avoid milk and dairy products for at least an hour after taking iron because the calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption., If you are suffering from a vitamin B12 deficiency that is causing your anemia, you need to get more of this nutrient from your diet. You should be getting 2.5 mcg of B12 every day. If you are pregnant, you should get 2.6 mcg per day. If you are nursing, you should be getting 2.8 mcg every day. Eat at least two to three servings of vitamin B12 rich foods every day to get these daily amounts. Foods rich is vitamin B12 include:


Breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12
Beef, liver, poultry, sardines, salmon, tuna, and cod
Eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese
Foods with added vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers, Deficiencies of folate, another form of vitamin B, can also cause anemia. Men over 13 years old should have 400 mcg of folate per day. Women over 13, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding should have 400 to 600 mcg per day. To help with this, you should eat two to three servings of folate rich foods every day. These foods include:


Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid, which is a form of folate
Kale, broccoli, lettuces, spinach, Swiss chard, beet greens, and collard greens
Dried beans, such as lentils, black-eyed peas, pinto, garbanzo, and kidney
Beef liver
Eggs
Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and other fruits and fruit juices, Smokers should get an extra 35 mg daily. Vitamin C also enhances iron absorption, so vitamin C containing foods can be taken with the iron-containing foods to increase your overall absorption. Vitamin C rich foods include:


Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, and limes
Kiwi fruit, papaya, and pineapple
Berries such as strawberries and raspberries
Cantaloupe
Vegetables including broccoli, tomatoes, red peppers, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and leafy green vegetables., You should keep track of how much of iron, B12, folate and Vitamin C you get each day. You can do this by keeping track of the serving size of the foods you eat and checking online to see how much of each nutrient is in the serving size you eat.


You can also determine how much of each nutrient is in the food you eat by using the an online Food Advisor, which is a questionnaire that can help determine your overall vitamin and mineral intake., If you find that you can't get enough nutrients from food sources, you can take a supplement to pick up the slack. Try to buy vitamins and minerals derived from organic, whole foods, instead of those that have been chemically synthesized. You can buy supplements for each separate vitamin and mineral, or you can buy a multivitamin that has them all in it.


Make sure any supplement you buy has been tested by an independent lab. It also needs a Seal of Approval from a reputable investigation agency, such as Consumer Labs, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), LabDoor, or the Natural Products Association (NPA).Always follow your doctors instructions and recommendations in regards to supplements.

, Although these nutrients exist in nature, you can get too much of them. If you are getting too much of them from food and supplements, you can have some adverse effects on your health.


For example, there is a condition called hemochromatosis that can be acquired if you are taking too much iron as a supplement. It can be very serious., Once you have been using nutrition for awhile, you should get retested to see the if your anemia has improved. The general timeline for getting tested again is six to eight weeks. Your doctor may recommend you get retested sooner, so do as he or she recommends.

Avoid triggers.,
Treat sickle cell anemia.,
Deal with a G6PD deficiency.",How to Treat Anemia Naturally2," For hereditary forms of anemias, you cannot get rid of them. However, you can treat them by avoiding certain triggers that cause you to destroy more RBCs. Common ways to keep yourself healthy so you do not trigger RBC destruction include keeping yourself warm, staying hydrated, limiting contact with food triggers, and avoiding contact with people with colds, the flu, those with other bacterial or viral disorders.


This can be easier said than done. You can't always know if the people you come into contact with has a cold or the flu.
Stay as healthy as possible to keep your immune system health and be less susceptible to infections., Sickle cell anemia can be triggered by cold, dehydration, exercise, fever, and infections.When you have sickle cell anemia, there are certain lifestyle changes you can make to help avoid a sickle crisis. These include:


Drinking plenty of water every day
Avoiding temperature extremes, either cold or hot
Exercising in moderation
Flying only on airplanes with pressurized cabins
Using supplemental oxygen at high altitudes, A certain form of anemia is caused by the deficiency of a specific enzyme called G6PD. This form of anemia can be triggered by foods, drugs, and other substances. Always read the list of ingredients on any product you eat or come into contact with to make certain it doesn’t contain anything that can trigger it. Ingredients that trigger issues if you have G6PD deficiency are:


Fava beans and all legumes
Sulfites
Menthol and artificial blue coloring
Black or green teas
Ascorbic acid
Tonic water, which contains quinine
Some gluten-free products, which may contain fava beans"

Notice the symptoms.,
Determine the cause.,
Know the risks.,
Diagnose anemia.,
Treat anemia medically.",How to Treat Anemia Naturally3," The symptoms of anemia can vary depending on the specific cause or your specific case. However, in general, the symptoms of anemia include:


Constant fatigue or a feeling of weakness that is not well relieved by rest or sleep
Pale skin and cold hands and feet
Dizziness
A rapid or an irregular heartbeat
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain
Confusion and memory loss
Headache, If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your physician to determine the cause. There are four main causes of anemia, which lead to multiple types of anemia.


The most common type of anemia is a result of a nutrient deficiency, which causes your body to not make enough RBCs. This is generally caused by a lack of iron or B vitamins in your system.
Anemia can also be caused by chronic disease, which lowers the production of the RBCs. These include arthritis, HIV/AIDS, kidney failure, and leukemia.
Anemia can also be caused by microbleeds or microhemorrhages, which are microscopic internal bleeds that cause blood loss that the RBCs cannot keep up with. These are often in the intestines.Anemia can also be caused by autoimmune issues, which are often genetic. Hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemias are genetic anemias that cause your immune system to destroy your RBCs., There are many risk factors for anemia, some which can be prevented and others that you cannot. The most common risk factors for anemia include:


Nutritional deficiencies, such as a diet lacking in vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, riboflavin, B12, folate, iron, and copper, needed to produce RBCs.Intestinal conditions that prevent the absorption of nutrients, such as celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), irritable bowel diseases (IBD), and leaky gut syndrome.Menstruation
Pregnancy
Chronic disease
Chronic blood loss from a bleeding ulcer or the use of certain medications
Family history or genetic conditions
A history of alcoholism, certain viral infections, liver disease, exposure to toxic chemicals, and a history of certain medications, Your doctor will perform a physical exam, which means he will listen to your heart and breathing. He or she will also check for physical signs of anemia as well as ask you about other symptoms. Your doctor will also likely draw a small amount of blood to check your blood count. This is a test that counts the number of RBCs and other cells in the blood and check the quality of your RBCs.


If the underlying cause of the anemia is not clear, other tests may be ordered., You have to get the correct diagnosis in order to find the best treatment that is designed for that type of anemia. You will likely be referred to a hematologist, a doctor who specialize in blood disorders, to get the best treatment. The treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause and severity of the anemia.


Medical treatments include dietary treatments and supplementation, hormones, immunosuppressant drugs, erythropoietin, chelation therapy, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, or surgery."

, Recent studies have shown that the long-time home remedy of chicken soup can decrease inflammation and reduce symptoms, congestion in particular.Eating chicken soup as you can may minimize your symptoms and help you get over your cold more quickly.Chicken soup has anti-inflammatory properties and also temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, which in turn relieves congestion.You don’t have to make your own chicken soup to get the benefits — store-bought, canned soup works just as well.

, Alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products can exacerbate the symptoms of a cold. Avoiding these products while you are sick may make you feel better and reduce the duration of your symptoms., Rinsing with a simple solution of salt water can keep help relieve a sore and scratchy throat.Although the benefits are temporary, you can use this remedy as often as you need it to help yourself feel better.Make a salt solution by dissolving 1/4 – 1/2 tsp of salt in 4 – 8 oz of warm water.
Gargle the solution, being careful not to swallow.

, Throat lozenges or sprays containing mild analgesics can help soothe a sore throat. Products that have eucalyptus or camphor may also help to relieve congestion.Suck on throat lozenges or use sprays every two to three hours, or according to the package or your doctor’s directions.Suck on the throat lozenge until it is completely gone. Don't try to chew it or swallow it whole, which can numb your throat and cause swallowing difficulties.You can buy throat lozenges and sprays at most pharmacies and some grocery stores and larger retailers.

, Nasal congestion is one of the peskiest symptoms of a cold. A saline nasal spry can help relieve congestion by loosening mucus.It is safe to use on children and can generally be used as frequently as you wish.You can get saline nasal drops over-the-counter at most pharmacies or large retailers. Make sure to follow the packing instructions or those of your doctor.
For some infants, doctors recommends using a few drops in your baby’s nose and then suctioning each nostril., You may have body aches and a headache with a cold. Consider taking an OTC medication (decongestants, nasal sprays, or antihistamines) to relieve pain and discomfort from a cold. It is important to take with care as directed on package and remember that these are for temporary use.


Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium to minimize pain.
Do not give children or teenagers aspirin, which associated with Reye’s syndrome.
Check with your healthcare provider before giving an infant or child any medication.

, Getting enough rest can help relieve your symptoms. If possible, stay home from work or school, especially if you have a fever or have taken medications that make you drowsy. Staying home from work or school can also prevent you from infecting other people with a cold.Take naps during the day if you can and make sure you get at least eight hours of sleep a night to help your body recover., Sleep in a bedroom that is comfortable, warm, and slightly humid. By controlling factors such as the temperature and humidity, having comfortable bedding, and keeping air circulating, you may help relieve the symptoms of a cold.Set temperature in bedroom to between 70 to 75°F (21 to 23.9°C), which can keep you warm and help you sleep.Use a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer to moisten the air, which can help relieve congestion and coughing.Make sure to clean the humidifier to prevent mold or bacteria growth.Breathing in steam from running a hot shower in a closed bathroom can help ease congestion.
Use a fan to keep air circulating or open a window if it is not cold outside., Many people rely on alternative medicine to prevent and relieve colds; however, studies have had mixed results regarding the effectiveness of vitamin C, Echinacea, or zinc as cold remedies.Use these remedies if you feel they work for you and make you feel better.


There is limited evidence that taking Vitamin C at the onset of cold symptoms may reduce the duration of your symptoms.Some studies have shown that taking echinacea at the onset of a cold can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.As with vitamin C and echinacea, studies on zinc have shown that it can reduce symptoms such as nausea and a bad taste in the mouth if taken within 24 hours after the onset of your cold.Do not use intranasal zinc, which can cause permanent damage to your sense of smell., A cold will usually resolve on its own and does not require a visit to the doctor. There are, however, some circumstances in which you should see your doctor. These include:


If there is no improvement of your cold symptoms after 10 days.
If you have a sore throat and a fever with no cold symptoms, you may have strep throat, a bacterial infection that requires an antibiotic.
If you experience any of the following symptoms: high fever (over 101.3°F or 38.5°C for adults), severe or worsening symptoms, severe headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, wheezing, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing. These symptoms indicate you may be developing or have a secondary infection such as pneumonia, sinusitis or ear infection.
Any infant three months old or younger who develops a cold or fever should always be seen by a healthcare professional.

, Although there is no cure for the common cold, there are effective ways to help prevent it. Employing basic measures such as handwashing, cleaning surfaces, and covering your mouth can help minimize your risk for contracting it.Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine for the common cold.Antibiotics will not be effective in treating a cold, as a cold is caused by a virus and antibiotics treat bacterial infections.

, One of the most effective ways to prevent a cold is by proper hand-washing techniques.This minimizes the spread of bacteria and the flu virus from surfaces that many people touch.Wash your hands in warm water with a mild soap for at least 20 seconds.Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.Make sure to wash your hands after touching anything in crowded places, such as handles on public transportation.

, Always cover both your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow to avoid contaminating your hands.Make sure to discard the tissue right away and then wash your hands.Covering your nose and mouth minimizes the risk of spreading your cold to those around you.
Encourage others to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.

, Colds are very contagious, especially for children, and spreads most easily in places where there are large crowds of people. Minimizing time in crowded spaces may reduce your risk of getting a cold.Avoid contact with infected individuals. Do not share utensils and other personal objects with someone who has a cold.
If you have a cold, stay home to reduce the risk of spreading it to others., Germs spread easily in shared spaces such as bathrooms or on kitchen surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting these spaces frequently may help prevent spreading the cold to other members of your family or your friends and colleagues.Focus on spaces that everyone in your vicinity uses. This includes the toilet, bathroom sink, kitchen counters, and the kitchen sink. You may also want to disinfect door handles.
You can use any type of surface disinfectant available commercially.

Ask your doctor about an esophagram.,
Have an endoscopy.,
Take a blood test.",How to Treat a Hiatal Hernia1," If you are experiencing heartburn, belching, difficulty swallowing, or chest pain that you think might be caused by a hiatal hernia, ask your doctor to run some tests. To confirm that these symptoms are from a hiatal hernia and not just acid reflux (GERD), your doctor will need to see your stomach. He or she may perform an esophagram, which is a procedure where you drink a chalky liquid containing barium that coats your upper digestive tract. You will then be given an X-ray, which will, because of the barium, provide a clear outline of your esophagus and stomach.


If a hiatal hernia is present, bulging may be seen around the esophagus stomach junction.;
, Your doctor may also order an endoscopy. During this exam, a thin flexible tube with a light and video camera, called an endoscope, is slid down your throat and into your esophagus and stomach. This tool checks for obvious structural changes or visible signs of tissue inflammation that may provide evidence of an existing hiatal hernia., To test for complications that arise from a hiatal hernia, your doctor may run a blood test. Acid reflux and symptomatic hiatal hernias can lead to bleeding if the tissue is inflamed or irritated as well as lead to blood vessel rupture. Too much bleeding can lead to anemia and low red blood cells. Your doctor may take a small amount of your blood and send it out to a lab to detect if you have low red blood cells."

Stop smoking.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Eat healthier foods.,
Consider other dietary concerns.,
Reduce pressure in your stomach.,
Lose weight.",How to Treat a Hiatal Hernia2," Since hiatal hernias cause acid reflux symptoms, the first method of treatment is to prevent reflux, reduce acid production, and increase esophagus clearance. This can be done by reducing risk factors and implementing lifestyle changes.Smoking can make your hiatal hernia symptoms worse. Studies have shown that smoking tobacco relaxes this sphincter, a band of muscles around where the esophagus meets the stomach. The sphincter squeezes to prevent stomach contents from coming back up.



Quitting smoking can be challenging. Speak with family, friends, and your doctor if you are seriously considering it. They can motivate and guide you to treatment options such as medications, nicotine patch, nicotine gum, and other healthy choices.

, Certain types of foods can lead to stomach irritation and increased acid production. In order to prevent and control your symptoms, avoid or limit foods such as:Chocolate
Onions and garlic
Spicy foods
Fatty foods such as fried foods
Citrus foods such as oranges
Tomato based foods
Alcohol
Peppermint or spearmint
Carbonated beverages like sodas
Dairy products, such as milk and ice cream
Coffee

, In addition to avoiding certain foods, there are foods you can eat which may help you prevent further symptoms from your hiatal hernia. Try to include healthier options for your stomach to handle, such as lean meats like skinless chicken, red meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. You can also improve your diet by:Baking or broil foods instead of frying.
Skimming off fat from meat during cooking.
Trying not to use too much spicy seasoning.
Eating low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt instead of ice cream.
Steaming your vegetables with water instead of broth.
Limiting butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautéing.
Choosing low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products.

, There are other food-related concerns that need to be considered when you are dealing with a hiatal hernia. When purchasing food items, always check the content or ingredient lists. If you are unsure if other food products may be triggering symptoms, take note before eating them and compare to it to how you feel after eating them. Also try eating smaller meals throughout the day rather than large meals. This gives your stomach an easier time to digest and produces less acid than larger meals.


Do not eat too quickly either as this may give a similar effect., Increased abdominal pressure can put more pressure on the sphincter, leading to acid reflux or hernias. To reduce pressure on your stomach, try not to strain when passing stool. If you do strain or feel more constipated, add more fiber based foods to your diet such as fruits and grains. Try not to lift heavy objects because this puts pressure on your stomach and can aggravate symptoms or cause a hernia.


Avoid lying down on your back or side after you eat.Think of it as tipping over a glass of water — if you are flat and the sphincter isn't functioning the stomach contents will easily enter into the esophagus causing symptoms. Being upright will help to minimize the risk.

, If you are overweight or obese, this can cause problems related to your hiatal hernia. Studies have shown that excessive body weight is a risk factor for hiatal hernias.Try walking for about 30 min after meals to help you digest and possibly lose more weight. A study has shown that walking for 30 min after eating reduced weight over a month when compared to walking after waiting an hour after mealsAs you go along, gradually increase your workouts. Perform more cardio based workouts such as running, jogging, jumping jacks, and biking, to help you burn more fat and calories.
If you do this in addition to changing your diet to help your hernia, you are more likely to lose weight.

Ask your physician about medication.,
Understand the need for surgery.,
Ask your doctor what happens during surgery.,
Be familiar with the surgery.",How to Treat a Hiatal Hernia3," You should not start medicating you have been assessed and properly diagnosed by a physician. Once your doctor has confirmed your diagnosis, she may suggest some different medications that you can take to help with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Be aware that these medications will not treat the hernia itself; rather, they will treat the GERD symptoms caused by your hernia. Antacids such as Rolaids, tums, Mylanta, and Maalox can be used before, during, or after meals to neutralize stomach acid. They come in many forms such as tablets, chewables, and liquids.You can also take H-2 blockers such as Zantac and Pepcid, which block receptors in your stomach to reduce acid production. It takes 30 to 90 minutes for the medications to take effect and it is advised to be taken before the first meal of the day. These can last up to 24 hours.Proton pump inhibitors like Nexium and Prilosec work similarly to H2 blockers by blocking glands that produce acid in the stomach. Take 30 min before your first meal of the day.All of these medications can be bought over the counter without a prescription. No matter the medication, always follow directions as labeled.
There are some fairly significant illnesses on the differential diagnosis list that have very similar symptoms to a hiatal hernia, such as esophagitis, an esophageal motility disorder, and coronary artery disease. You need to see your doctor to rule these out before attempting treatment, even with over-the-counter products.

, 95% of hiatial hernias are Type 1 or sliding and these do not require surgery. 5% are other types of hiatial hernias called ""paraesophageal."" Patients with paraesophageal hernias who are symptomatic are recommended to have surgical repair.A paraesophageal hernia may lead to severe symptoms requiring emergent attention, such as a blockage of the passage of food, strangulation (blood supply becoming cut off to herniated tissue), perforation, and respiratory compromise., When all else fails, surgery is presented as an option. The surgeon will attempt to reduce the contents of the hernia, mobilize the esophagus, close the hiatal defect, reduce esophageal reflux and fixate the stomach. To treat a hiatal hernia, there are three types of surgeries that you may need. One type is a Nissen fundoplication, a procedure that involves a 360 degree wrap around of the stomach esophagus junction. The hiatus where the esophagus passes through is also repaired. You may also have a Belsey fundoplication, which is an operation that involves a 270 degree wrap in an attempt to reduce the incidence of gas bloating and trouble swallowing.


You may also have a Hill repair, which is a procedure where the top part of the stomach, before it becomes the esophagus, is anchored to the back of the abdomen, strengthening the anti-reflux mechanism. Some surgeons then tack the stomach down in the abdomen to prevent it from migrating upwards again.The choice depends on the surgeon's familiarity and comfort with each procedure.

, The most common type of surgical approach is laparoscopic. The surgeon uses an inserted camera probe to visualize the area and another probe to perform the surgery. This approach, as opposed to the open stomach surgery, leads to less scarring, better outcomes, and quicker recovery. Your surgeon will make three to five small cuts in your belly. A thin tube with a tiny camera, called a laparoscope, on the end is inserted through one of these cuts, while other surgical tools are inserted in the others.


The laparoscope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon does the repair while viewing the inside of your belly on the monitor.
The surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia, so you are asleep and pain-free. Surgery usually takes two to three hours."

Most people who have H. pylori will never experience symptoms.If you do experience ulcer-like symptoms, there's a good chance H. pylori is the problem. Here are the symptoms to look for:Pain in the abdomen with a burning, acidic quality
Indigestion or ""gnawing pain"" in the stomach
Acid reflux
Nausea
Bloody or black and tarry stools
Blood in Vomit
Sudden unconsciousness
Rigidity of the stomach (peritonitis), in severe cases;
, Prolonged abdominal pain requires treatment, regardless of the cause. The infection won't go away on its own, so it's important to visit your doctor to find out whether H. pylori is the problem. This way, you can begin treatment right away to heal your stomach.


Rarely, an H. pylori infection can lead to stomach cancer. That's why it's essential never to ignore abdominal pain, bloody stools, and other signs that you might have H. pylori.

, Speak with your doctor about your concerns that the problem might be H. pylori. Doctors test for H. pylori in a variety of different ways. The doctor will choose the testing method that best suits your symptoms and condition. The following tests are most common:A urea breath test. The bacteria produces a urea compound. A urea breath test is the gold standard of diagnostic methods. It is the most accurate test for H. pylori.
A stool test antigen, in which a sample is examined in a laboratory for signs of H. pylori. This is considered the second most effective.
A blood test. This test reveals the presence of antibodies that fight H. pylori. It is 65 to 95% effective, making it the least reliable test.
A biopsy. A tissue sample is removed from your stomach using a procedure called an endoscopy. A biopsy is usually only performed if an endoscopy is needed for other reasons such as treating an ulcer, bleeding, or making sure there is no cancer.Most doctors will order one of these tests if your symptoms match those of an H. pylori infection.

, H pylori is often spread through poor sanitation and hygiene practices. If you believe you have the bacteria, you should get other people who live in the same environment as you tested also.This is important not only for the health of other household members, but also to prevent reinfection.
This is especially important for spouses or other romantic partners. The bacteria may be transmitted through kissing with saliva.

, Since H. pylori is a bacteria, it can be successfully treated with a short course of antibiotics.In most cases, you'll taken two different antibiotics at the same time. Your doctor will likely prescribe one of these:


Amoxicillin, 2 grams 4 times per day, for one day, and Flagyl, 500 mg orally 4 times per day, for one day. This regimen is 90 percent effective.
Biaxin, 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days and Amoxicillin, 1 gram orally twice daily for 7 days. This regimen is 80 percent effective.
Children will often taken Amoxicillin, 50 mg/kg in divided doses, twice daily (up to a max of 1 gram twice daily ) for 14 days. Along with this they will often be prescribed Biaxin:, 15 mg/kg in divided doses twice daily (up to a max of 500 mg twice daily) for 14 days.
It's important to take the full course of antibiotics, even after your symptoms have subsided. Your doctor will prescribe the amount necessary to kill the bacteria. Even if your symptoms die down, you may still have H. pylori in your system.

, While you're taking antibiotics, your doctor will also recommend that you take acid-protectors. They keep your ulcer from getting worse. They will also give your stomach lining time to heal.


Your stomach naturally produces acid to aid in digestion, but when you have an ulcer the acid can cause further damage.
Most often, doctors will prescribe Bismuth subsalicylate, or Pepto Bismol. It coats the stomach to protect it from acid. It also helps kill the bacteria. The amount and frequency will vary based on which antibiotics you are taking.

, Your doctor will also prescribe a PPI. These medications prevent acid production by inhibiting the ""pumps"" in stomach cells that activate gastric acid secretion.


In most cases, you'll receive a prescription for Lansoprazole. The amount and frequency of doses will depend on which antibiotics you are taking.
Children may prescribed Omeprazole, 1 mg/kg divided twice daily (to a max of 20 mg twice daily) for 14 days.

, Your doctor should perform a second round of tests after four weeks to make sure that the H. pylori infection is gone. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders during your treatment and before your second testing session.


Reinfection can occur and start the cycle over again if the entire household is not cured. This must be confirmed after four weeks of treatment.If you have severe symptoms during treatment, make an appointment with your doctor right away. Antibiotics do not always work, and your doctor may prescribe different treatment.

, Studies suggest that eating broccoli helps to reduce H. pylori. Consuming broccoli regularly doesn't entirely kill off the H. pylori. But, it can reduce the population.Eating a serving of broccoli several times per week may be beneficial.

, Studies have shown that green tea brings about a significant reduction in the H. pylori for people who drink it every day. It contains high levels of polyphenols, which inhibit H. pylori production. If you don't like the taste of green tea, green tea extract has the same beneficial effects.
Red wine, which also has high levels of polyphenols, has similar benefits to green tea.

, Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that keep harmful bacteria populations from getting out of control. Studies show that regularly ingesting probiotics may be a good natural way to keep H. pylori at bay.Yogurt, kimchi, kombucha and other fermented products contain probiotics.

, The primary factor in avoiding H. pylori infection is to practice proper hygiene and good hand washing. You should wash your hands, especially after using the restroom, or before handling food. Wash your hands in the following manner:Use warm water ( 120 degrees) and 3-5 cc (roughly a teaspoon) of liquid soap. The soap does not have to be antibacterial. Wash for a total of 15-30 seconds.

, Eat a diet containing adequate proportions of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals and water. This will help you maintain good health. Having a strong immune system can reduce the risk of infection with many bacteria.


Exact proportions vary based on weight,gender activity level, etc. But, caloric intake should be approximately 2000 calories per day, as a broad approximation. Get the majority of calories from fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes and grains, and low fat proteins.
Even with a balanced diet, 67% of dieticians recommend dietary supplements. These supplements fill nutritional gaps that are not satisfied by food alone., Many physicians recommend about 500 mg per day.Be aware that vitamin C is acidic and can irritate the stomach. It's a good idea to take a buffered form of the vitamin or try to get it through foods.Good choices include cantaloupe, cabbage, citrus fruits, and red pepper.Because of its acidity, its a good idea to talk to your doctor about Vitamin C supplements you take if you are receiving treatment for H. pylori.

, Studies suggest H. pylori may be transmitted via saliva.If you know someone who has H. pylori, avoid saliva contact with them until it is confirmed that their treatment was successful.


For example, if your spouse has H. pylori, avoid kissing him or her, and do not share a toothbrush.

, Especially when traveling to countries with poor sanitation, be careful about what you eat or drink.Consider drinking bottled water when visiting countries with poor water sanitation.
Refrain from eating at any questionable or roadside food trucks, etc. Eat only in restaurants with sanitation standards similar to an American standard of sanitation. Kitchen utensils should be washed in hot water (as warm as you can safely tolerate) with antibacterial soap.
Using hand sanitizer can also be helpful in these types of situations. Washing your hands with unclean water can do more harm than good.

Continue to apply ice and heat.",How to Treat a Groin Injury," Apply ice to the injured area as soon as possible to help limit the swelling, stop any bleeding under the skin, and avoid bruising.Apply ice every two to three hours, for 15 minutes each time, for the first 24 to 72 hours following the injury.Avoid applying ice directly to the skin. Use an ice pack, crushed ice in a baggie, or frozen veggies like peas, wrapped in a cloth or towel.Continue to apply ice for several days after the injury and, upon returning to activity, three to four times each day or directly after mild activity.;
, The severity of your groin injury determines how long you need to refrain from physical activity.Mild to moderate groin strains require at least two to four weeks of rest. More severe injuries require at least six to eight weeks or even longer for adequate recovery.Take at least five to seven days off from physical activity to allow your injury to start healing. Evaluate your pain at that time to determine a gradual return to your sport., Compression helps to further reduce swelling and stabilize the injured muscle.The use of a special brace designed for the groin area is especially helpful. It is made to fit the groin area snugly without being too tight, which can cut off circulation to the region. Braces are available in most drugstores.
Elastic wraps or groin strapping can also be used, but use caution to avoid wrapping the area too tightly., This helps to prevent swelling and to encourage adequate blood flow.Use rolled towels, blankets, or pillows to raise the injured leg as often as possible. Try to raise the area above the level of the hip., Once several days has passed beyond the initial injury, and if time permits, apply heat between the ice applications.Heat can help to relieve some of the pain and discomfort associated with the injury., Drugs that help reduce inflammation and pain include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.Acetaminophen products available over-the-counter can help with pain management, but do not address inflammation.
Follow the instructions on the product label, or directions provided by your doctor.

, Groin strains or injuries can can have similar symptoms to other conditions, such as a sports hernia.Make sure what you are experiencing is actually a groin strain and not something else.


The symptoms commonly seen with a groin strain or injury include feelings of tightness or cramping, sudden or sharp pain, and pain when the muscle is either contracted or stretched.Severe injuries can include extreme pain even when just walking.A sports hernia is indicated by pain in the lower abdomen and groin, pain when coughing or sneezing, and continuing groin pain that flares up when you are active.Stress fractures in your femur or pubic bone may cause pain in the groin and spread to your buttocks.You will likely feel pain in the evening, tenderness and swelling, and your symptoms will not improve when you apply rest, ice, compression, and elevation.Testicular pain, numbness, tingling, increased swelling, urinary symptoms, and fevers should prompt you to see your doctor to investigate other potential causes.

, If your symptoms are mild, and you are not sure what type of injury you have, an exercise may help you to determine if you have a groin injury.An adduction exercise that helps identify a groin injury involves placing a lightly weighted object, like a medicine ball, between your legs. Try to compress it by gently squeezing your legs together. If this causes you pain, then you most likely have a groin strain., A dull and painful ache that gets worse with movement or exercise may indicate a hernia rather than a groin injury.Another sign of a hernia includes a bulge in your lower abdomen area, or upper groin region. A hernia occurs when a weakened part of the muscle tissue along the abdominal wall allows a part of the intestine to push through.A hernia requires medical attention., There are five muscles that support movements of your legs called adduction.Adduction means to move inward towards the center of your body. People that commonly experience injuries involving the adductor muscles are athletes that run, kick, sprint, quickly change position, or exert great strength when performing a cross-over motion, as in kicking a soccer ball.The five adductor muscles are called the pectineus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, gracilis, and adductor magnus., Groin injuries are graded based on the severity of the injury.Grade 1 injuries are milder and are caused by overstretching one or more of the five muscles, with micro-tearing of muscle fibers within the injury.Grade 2 injuries are the most common type, and involve partial tearing of muscle tissue.Grade 3 injuries are the most severe, cause more intense pain, and result from complete tearing, or rupture, of one or more of the five muscles., The amount of time you will need to recover depends on the grade of your injury.In many cases, up to six to eight weeks, or even longer, are needed to allow the muscle tissue to properly heal.It is important that you take the time recommended by your doctor in order to prevent re-injury.

, If you feel your symptoms are worse, or if you do not see significant improvement within a reasonable amount of time, there may be another cause of the pain.See your doctor as instructed to evaluate the persistent discomfort and examine you for other possible causes.Monitor your pain. If you have little or no improvement, or if your pain worsens after the first few days following the injury, seek medical attention., A knotted area, lump, or swollen mass, in or near a testicle requires medical attention.Any pain that occurs along your lower abdomen and to the side, or pain that radiates into your groin, also warrants seeing a doctor., Use the severity of symptoms as a guide to return to activity.Returning to your sport while you still have pain can lead to subsequent injury.Avoid activity if you have any pain. Do not walk quickly, jog, or run, if you have any pain.Once you are pain-free, resume your activity very gradually to prevent further injury., As you begin to resume your activity, pay attention to your body signals and respect the limits of your body. Notice pain that goes beyond the normal ""burn"" of exercise and take it as a signal to stop what you are doing.You want to challenge yourself during your workout, but you don't want to push yourself to the point of injuring yourself again. ]


If you feel pain during your activity, then reduce the intensity or duration and work back towards that level more gradually.It may be frustrating, but it would be even more frustrating to have to sit out after re-injuring yourself.
Persistent pain may indicate a greater potential to reinjure the area or may be a warning sign that another underlying injury may be involved. Back down on the intensity or duration of exercise until the pain improves. See your doctor if the pain persists., Slowly go through the movements that you will need to accomplish in order to actively participate in your sport.Move slowly but deliberately, avoiding weight or friction, to determine if you are pain-free before you return to actively participating., A trainer who is knowledgeable in your sport can not only help you to recover up to 100% of your capacity, but can also teach you the proper warm up and stretching activities that will help you avoid future injury.

, A major cause of groin injury is the lack of proper warm up and stretching exercises prior to physical activity.Stretching loosens the adductor muscle and prepares it for activity, while a sufficient warm up period before exercise gets the blood flowing to the muscle and preps it to work properly under stress.Massaging the area can also help get blood flowing and warm up your joints.
Perform a simple stretch that targets the groin area before and after you work out or participate in sports. Sit on the floor with your back gently against the wall. Place the bottoms of your feet together and pull your feet in toward your groin. Gently and slowly move your knees toward the floor. Hold this stretch for 20 seconds and repeat once., For several weeks upon resuming activity, continue to apply ice to the area after exercise, along with compression and periods of rest.Continue to apply heat after exercise to help reduce any residual pain."

Schedule a doctor's appointment to diagnose the condition and begin treatment.,
Follow the doctor prescribed treatment for hyperkalemia.,
Enter the hospital for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia.",How to Treat Hyperkalemia," If symptoms are present and the patient has a risk of hyperkalemia because of kidney dysfunction, adrenal gland disease or medications, physicians should monitor for the condition.


Severe cases of hyperkalemia require immediate medical attention. An extremely elevated potassium level is a life threatening condition that requires medical intervention.
The doctor can determine levels of potassium in the body with a blood test. In most cases, the physician orders blood tests to monitor for elevated potassium because of a medical condition or medication.;
, Mild cases of hyperkalemia may be controlled through diet or discontinuing a medication, but some patients require treatment in a hospital.


In mild cases, the doctor may prescribe a low potassium diet to control levels. Patients must avoid foods rich in potassium such as bananas, tomatoes, lentils, nuts, potatoes, salmon, peaches and watermelon. In addition, patients should avoid food allergens such as dairy, wheat, soy and food additives. A diet to treat hyperkalemia also reduces or eliminates refined foods such as pasta, white bread and sugar.

, The physician uses a combination of medications and treatment to decrease potassium levels and protect the body from damage caused by hyperkalemia.


Medications that treat hyperkalemia include Albuterol and Epinephrine to force potassium back into the cells. Potassium levels can be elevated when potassium leaves the cells and enters the bloodstream.
Physicians use medications to encourage the excretion of potassium through the gastrointestinal system.
Doctors prescribe diuretics to lower potassium levels by encouraging excretion through urine.
Physicians treat patients hospitalized for hyperkalemia with the administration of intravenous calcium to protect the heart and muscles from the effects of elevated potassium.
Treatment also includes intravenous administration of insulin and glucose to encourage potassium back into cells.
When other treatment measures fail, the patient may require dialysis. Physicians also treat patients with dialysis when the patient experiences renal failure.

Symptoms usually develop slowly over the years. You may not notice any symptoms at first or attribute them to other things.If your doctor find that you have laboratory abnormalities compatible with hypothyroidism in the setting of having clinical symptoms, he will recommend to start you on thyroid hormone replacement.

Your doctor will listen to your symptoms and take a blood sample to test your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels and the level of thyroid hormone thyroxine.;
, Before starting your thyroid medication, you should ask your doctor about any foods, supplements, or medications you need to avoid. Likewise, you should also talk to your doctor before starting any new supplement or medication to make sure that it will not interfere. Many drugs interact with levothyroxine.Amphetamines

, Hypothyroidism is almost always treated with the synthetic thyroid hormone called levothyroxine (Levothroid, Synthroid) which is a daily, oral medication. When working right, it restores your thyroid hormone levels to the correct balance and reverses the symptoms of hypothyroidism.If the dosage is correct, you should start feeling less fatigued within one to two weeks.
The medication should also help lower cholesterol levels that might have been raised by your hypothyroidism, and it has also been known to reverse weight gain related to the disease.
Note that most patients will need to be treated for the rest of their lives. You will likely have your thyroid hormone levels checked on a yearly basis to determine if the dosage is correct or needs to be altered.

, It can take a few months before your doctor determines the right dosage. The doctor will likely measure your TSH level via a blood test before prescribing an initial dosage.Six to eight weeks after you start your medication, another similar test will be performed to determine if the dosage is right.


A typical starting dose will be calculated by your doctor, based on your weight. This amount may increase every three to four weeks until TSH levels are normal.The proper dosage depends on how elevated your TSH levels are, your age, and presence of any other medical problems that may be affected by thyroid replacement treatment (e.g. heart failure, depression, osteoporosis).If the dosage is too low, symptoms associated with hypothyroidism might still persist, including constipation, feeling cold, feeling sluggish, and gaining weight.
If the dosage is too high, you might feel excessive nervousness, have problems sleeping, and suffer from shaking or tremors.

, Even though you will typically have your thyroid hormone levels checked yearly, there is some chance that your thyroid levels can drop again before your yearly check-up comes along. Watch for signs of hypothyroidism, including sluggishness, constipation, confusion, and a frequent feeling of being cold.See your doctor if you feel like your medication is not working.


If you develop a bowel disease or take medicine that affects your intestinal tract, your thyroid medication may not be getting absorbed correctly. The condition will either need to be treated or your thyroid medication will need to be increased.
Similarly, your doctor may increase your thyroid medication dosage if you are taking estrogen or phenytoin.
You also need to make sure that you are not taking too much thyroid medication. Over time, an excess can cause irregular heartbeats and osteoporosis.

, Some foods are known to interact with thyroid medications. You can still eat these foods, but they need to be consumed several hours before or after you take your medication. These foods include walnuts, soybean flour, cottonseed meal, and large amounts of dietary fiber.It is best to take your medication on an empty stomach and with a full glass of water.If you eat a high-fiber diet, you will need larger doses of medication. Discuss this with your doctor.

, Levothyroxine is a safe medication and side effects are not common when you are on the right dosage. Less common side effects include chest pain or discomfort, decreased urine output, difficulty swallowing or breathing, fever, increased blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, menstrual changes, skin irritation, sweating, mood changes, muscle weakness, increased appetite, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.See your doctor if you experience any of these side effects.

, Before synthetic levothyroxine was developed, doctors used to prescribe desiccated thyroid tablets (Armour and Nature-Throid)with thyroid obtained from animal thyroid glands. Since these lacked consistency and potency, such extract is rarely used today, but you can still opt for it if you prefer a natural alternative.


These extracts contain thyroxine and triiodothyronine, two types of thyroid hormones. Synthetic medication, in contrast, only offers a supply of thyroxine, but the triiodothyronine you need can be derived from the thyroxine.Note that you should only use extracts prescribed by a doctor and not a glandular concentrate sold over-the-counter at a natural food store.

Know that there is no hypothyroidism diet.,
Consider alternative medicine.,
Avoid foods that contain iodine.,
Wait before consuming soy products.,
Take essential fatty acid and B vitamin supplements.,
Talk to your doctor about L-tyrosine supplements.,
Consider taking herbs.,
Be careful with alcohol and tobacco.",How to Treat Hypothyroidism2," There is a lot of information about using your diet to cure and manage hypothyroidism. However, there is no evidence that a specific diet can improve your thyroid function.Focus on eating an overall healthy diet and taking care of yourself.

, If you are interested in using alternative medicine, find a Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Practitioner and let your primary care physician know that you are trying alternative treatments.Your regular doctor may not be supportive of you using alternative treatments, but you still need to let her know any additional treatments that you begin taking because some may interact with your prescribed medications. Some common natural treatments may, in fact, make hypothyroidism worse.Visit the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians website to find a certified doctor.These doctors have special training in using nutrition to heal the body.

, Too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in some people.Your doctor may recommend that patients with hypothyroidism avoid certain foods — be sure to ask before making any dietary changes.Iodine is found in fish, dairy products, and seaweed. Your daily iodine intake should not exceed 600 mcg/day.Talk to your doctor about the appropriate amount of iodine for your diet.
Organic milk may have less iodine than non-organic milk.
This is not, however, true in developing countries. In fact, in these countries, a lack of iodine is actually a common cause of hypothyroidism.

, It is unclear whether people who have hypothyroidism should avoid soy. Soy may interfere with your body's ability to absorb synthetic thyroid medication.Current recommendations state that you do not have to avoid soy foods if you have hypothyroidism, but if you are taking synthetic thyroid medication, then you should wait four hours after taking thyroid medication before consuming any products that contain soy.It is important that you have an adequate intake of iodine if you eat soy foods.Most people in the United States get enough iodine in their diet. There is no need for you to supplement your iodine intake.
If you have questions or concerns about consuming soy, speak with your doctor.

, If your hypothyroidism is caused by an autoimmune reaction, fatty acids can help reduce inflammation in your body. High doses of fish oil can be used to decrease inflammation. Your doctor should help you determine the proper dosage and monitor your intake because high doses of fish oil affects your body's blood clotting ability.Vitamin B-12 supplementation can help reduce your hypothyroid symptoms and give you more energy.

, L-tyrosine is a supplement that is thought to help your hypothyroidism. People with hypothyroidism have low levels of tyrosine, so some people think that increasing your levels of tyrosine may help treat hypothyroidism, though this has not been proven. You must talk to your doctor before you begin taking L-tyrosine especially if you are taking a prescribed hypothyroid medication, or you risk worsening your condition.The recommended dose is 500 mg, two to three times a day.Be aware that there is no scientific evidence to support that the use of L-tyrosine helps with hypothyroidism.You should not take this supplement if you have high blood pressure or symptoms of mania (e.g. racing thoughts, fast talking, irritability, high energy, overly good mood). In addition, it can interact with the drug Levodopa., Herbs that have been studied for treating hypothyroidism are Coleus (Coleus forskohlii), Guggul (Commiphora mukul), and Bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus). These herbs can be taken as capsules, powders, teas, glycerine extracts, or alcohol extracts.Do not take alcohol extracts if you have a history of alcoholism.
Put 1 tsp of herb in 1 cup of hot water and allow it to steep for 5-10 minutes if using a leaf or 10 - 20 minutes if it is in root form. You will need to drink two to four cups per day.
Speak with your doctor before you try any of these herbs as they may interact with your other medications or medical conditions.

, Both alcoholand tobaccohave a negative effect on thyroid function. However, moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to protect against hypothyroidism.Speak with your doctor about your alcohol consumption habits. Smoking is harmful for your health overall and should be avoided. However, if you quit smoking after you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, make sure your doctor monitors your TSH levels. Smoking cessation is associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism.Although hypothyroidism risk increases after you quit smoking, you should still try to quit smoking. This will be best for you in the long term.
Moderate alcohol consumption is one drink a day for women, and up to two drinks per day for men. One drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits."

To lessen the strain and irritation on your shoulder pull the weight down in front of your neck.
Start with two appropriately weighted dumbbells in each hand. Bend your knees slightly, straighten your back, push out your chest a little bit, and keep your arms at your sides.
Begin to slowly raise both of your arms — palms facing the ground — to the sides in a controlled motion. When your arms are parallel to the ground, begin lowering them until they are at your sides again.;
, This exercise targets the chest and uses the shoulder muscles as a secondary and supportive muscle group.Lie on a bench with appropriated weighted dumbbells in each hand. Your feet should be firmly planted on the floor to help you stay balanced.
Start with your arms extended out straight in front of you and up towards the ceiling. Your palms should be facing each other.
Slowly lower your arms out away from your body. Keep a slight bend in your arms while you lower them. Stop when your arms are almost parallel to the floor.
To make sure you do not hurt yourself with this particular exercise, keep your arms in front of your shoulder when you're lowering the weights. Also, do not stretch your arms below the level of your torso.
Slowly bring your arms back up towards the ceiling and their starting position. Repeat as many times as you can without pain.

, The front raise works both the anterior and frontal part of the deltoid and can still be performed even with some of the worst shoulder injuries. Hold onto one plate instead of two individual dumbbells to help prevent further injury.Bend your knees slightly, straighten your back, push out your chest a little bit, and keep your arms at your sides. Grab an appropriated weighted plate with both hands.
Slowly raise both of your arms in front of you in a controlled motion. The plate should remain straight.
When your arms are parallel to the ground, begin lowering them until they are at your sides again. Do as many repetitions as you're able without pain.

, This exercise primarily targets the chest, with the shoulders helping stabilize your body.Since the shoulders are not the targeted muscle group, it shouldn't cause further injury.


This exercise requires a cable machine. Set the weight on the cables to an appropriate weight for your condition.
Stand up straight and relax with your arms resting in front of your hip bones. Keep your fists closed with the palms facing away from you.
Slowly raise both of your arms to the sides holding the end of one cable in each hand, then in front of your head — as if you were doing a jumping jack — until your arms cross. In a slow, controlled motion, bring your arms back down to starting position.
As a word of caution, crossovers may not be safe if your specific shoulder injury is aggravated by raising your arms over your head.

, This particular exercise targets your lateral and rear deltoid muscles and shouldn't cause too much pain in the shoulder joint.Stand straight up with feet hip-width apart. Hold an appropriate weighted dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing toward your body.
Slowly bring your hands up to mid-chest or slightly underneath nipple level. As you raise your arms, bend your elbows out away from your body. Do not continue the movement all the way up to the top as this can aggravate your shoulder.Slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position. Repeat this exercise as many times as you're able without furthering injuring or hurting your shoulder.

, This exercise focuses on strengthening the lateral muscles in your back. The shoulders are a secondary muscle group that provides support.Grab two appropriately weighted dumbbells holding one in each hand. Keep your arms at your sides with your palms facing in towards your body.
Bend over at the waist until your torso is almost parallel with the floor. Ensure to keep your back stiff and straight while allowing your arms to hand relaxed in front of you.
Slowly pull your arms up towards your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Bend your elbows so that your arms are flushed with the side of your body.
Slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position and repeat as many times as you're able without pain.

, Just because your shoulder is injured, doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be totally inactive. As long as it doesn't cause you pain, continue with your cardio and lower body exercises.


Most health professionals will recommend that you do 2 1/2 hours of moderate intensity cardio activities each week.
Focus on activities that do not require you to use your shoulders. Walking, slow jogging, cycling on a recumbent or upright (without leaning forward on your hands) bike or using the stair master should all be OK. However if any cardio hurts your shoulder, do not continue to do it.
Many lower body exercises do not require you to use your shoulders or any part of your upper body. Exercises like lunges, squats or leg lifts should be OK. Again, if it hurts your shoulder do not continue.

, Whenever you're injured, have recurrent pain or are restarting exercise after a healed injury, it's always important to talk to your doctor first.


Even if your injury wasn't serious or complex, you always need to get a medical clearance from your doctor prior to restarting any type of physical activity. She will be able to tell you whether or not exercise is safe and appropriate for you.
Ask your physician how much activity you can do, how often you can perform it and when you will be expected to have a full recovery.
In addition, keep in touch with your doctor about your injury. She will want to know if everything is OK, whether or not exercise is easy or difficult or if you're having continued or worsening pain.
Always discontinue exercise if your pain comes back or worsens. Call your physician immediately. If the pain is worsening, imaging maybe ordered or you may need a referral to a therapist (physiotherapist or chiropractor).

, Even without an injury, including regular rest and recovery days is important to any type of physical activity routine. It may be more important if you have an injury.When you're cleared for activity, it's important to take it slow and easy.You will need to include regular rest days as you ease yourself back into your normal exercise routine.
The shoulder joint involves a lot of ligaments, tendons and muscles. When its been injured and has been less active, you may feel some soreness once you restart activity.
Soreness is generally considered OK after an injury. However, when you feel sore, you want to include at least 24 – 48 hours of rest before exercising your shoulder again.
You need rest and recovery in order for the muscle to continue to heal and to rebuild strength., When you restart your typical exercise routine, take extra precautions with your shoulder. Being extra careful can help you prevent further injury to your shoulder.


Ice it. If you're feeling a little sore or just as an extra safety net, ice your shoulder after you exercise. Icing can help prevent inflammation and swelling.Also use compression shirts or wraps. Like ice, this can reduce inflammation and swelling in your shoulder and help keep your shoulder in place.Use proper form. This is always important for all types of exercise, but definitely important when you're recovering from an injury.If you do not use the correct form, you risk re-injuring or worsening your current shoulder injury.

, Do not continue with or start any exercise that causes your shoulder any pain. This can worsen your injury.


There are a few particular exercises that are recommended to avoid while recovering from a shoulder injury including: overhead presses, incline bench press, upright rows above shoulder level, dumbbell side lifts and lateral pull downs behind your neck.

Place the crutch under the arm opposite your injured leg.,
Position and balance the crutch properly.,
Prepare to take a step.,
Determine if there is a rail.,
Grab the railing with the hand on your injured side.,
Be extra cautious going down stairs.",How to Walk With One Crutch," When using a single crutch, you'll have to decide which side to use it on. Medical professionals recommend placing the crutch under the arm on the side of your healthy leg — or in other words, on the opposite side of your injured leg.Squeeze the crutch underneath your armpit and grab the hand grip that's roughly in the middle of the crutch.


Putting the crutch on your uninjured side allows you to lean away from your injured side and put less weight on it. However, in order to walk with one crutch, you'll have to put some weight on the injured side with each step.
Depending on your injury, your doctor may decide that putting weight on your injured side is not a good idea, so you may have to stick with two crutches or use a wheelchair. You should always listen to recommendations set forth by physician to ensure best rehabilitation outcome.
Adjust the length of the crutch so at least three fingers can fit between your armpit and the padding at the top of the crutch when you are standing straight. Adjust the hand grip so that it's at wrist level while your arm is hanging straight.;
, Once the single crutch is adjusted correctly and placed underneath the arm opposite your injured side, position it about 3-4 inches away (laterally) from the mid-point of the outside of your foot for best stability. Most, if not all, of your body weight should be supported by your hand and straightened arm because too much weight placed on your underarm can lead to soreness and potential nerve damage.There should be padding on both the hand grip and armpit support of your crutch. Padding provides better grip and shock absorption.
Avoid wearing bulky shirts or jackets while walking with a single crutch as it can lead to reduced movement and stability.
If your foot or leg is in a cast or walking boot, consider wearing a thicker-heeled shoe on your healthy foot so that there's not such a height difference between your two legs. Equal leg lengths provide greater stability and reduce the risk of hip or low back pain.

, As you prepare to walk, move the solitary crutch about 12 inches forward and also step forward with your injured leg at the same time.Then step past the crutch with your healthy leg while firmly grabbing the hand grip with your outstretched arm.To move forward, keep repeating this same sequence: stepping with the crutch and injured leg, then stepping past the crutch with the healthy leg.


Remember to balance yourself by keeping most of your weight on the crutch when stepping with your injured leg.
Be cautious and take it slow when walking with a single crutch. Make sure you have firm footing and there is nothing in your path to trip you up — make sure the environment is clear of clutter and area rugs are rolled up. Allow for extra time in getting from one place to another.
Refrain from supporting your weight with your armpit in order to prevent soreness, nerve damage and/or some sort of shoulder injury.

, Walking up and down stairs is actually much more difficult with two crutches compared to just using one. However, you should only use a solitary crutch to navigate stairs if a stair rail or support is present.Even if there is a railing, make sure it's stable and securely attached to the wall and able to support your weight.


If there is no stair rail, then either use both crutches, take the elevator, or get assistance from someone.
If there is a railing, you can grab it with one hand and carry one (or both) crutches in the other as you climb up the stairs — it might be easier and/or quicker without any crutches.

, As you start to climb the stairs, keep the crutch underneath the arm of your uninjured side and grab the railing with the hand from your injured side. Put pressure on the railing and the crutch on the opposite side at the same time and then step up with your uninjured leg first.Then bring your injured leg and the crutch up beside your uninjured leg, onto the same step. Repeat this pattern until you get to the top of the stairs, but be careful and take your time.


If possible, practice this skill with a physical therapist first.
If there is no railing, no elevator and no one around to help you and you absolutely must climb the stairs, then try to use the wall beside the stairs for support in a similar manner that you'd use the railing.
Allot more time for steep stairways and narrow steps, especially if you have large feet or are wearing a walking boot.

, Going down stairs with two crutches or a single crutch is potentially more dangerous than going up because of the distance you can fall if you lose your balance. As such, grip the railing firmly and place your injured leg on the lower step first, followed by the crutch on the opposite side and your uninjured leg. Don't put too much pressure on your injured leg, though, because a sharp jolt of pain may make you nauseated or dizzy. Always maintain balance and don't rush yourself. Follow the pattern of injured leg, then healthy leg all the way down to the bottom of the stairs.


Remember the pattern for walking down the stairs is opposite to that of walking up stairs.
Take note of any objects lying on the stairs that might get in your way.
It's always best to have someone help you down the stair if at all possible or convenient.

Know the major types of hormone replacement therapy or HRT.,
Learn the benefits of hormone replacement therapy.,
Discuss the form of HRT with your physician that will best work for you.,
Understand the risk of using hormone replacement therapy.,
Evaluate the cost of HRT treatment.,
Always keep a list of medications, including over the counter, that you are currently using.",How to Understand Hormone Replacement Therapy," Progesterone and estrogen are two widely used medications for hormone replacement.


Progesterone and estrogen combined therapy is used during the perimenopause or phase one of menopause.
Progesterone ""only"" therapy can be used by women who have their uterus.
Estrogen ""only"" therapy is used by women that had a hysterectomy or removal of the uterus.
Estrogen ""only"" taken by women that haven't undergone a hysterectomy have a greater risk for uterine cancer.;
, Generally, a physician prescribes HRT for the following conditions:


Hot flashes - A sudden and temporary increase in body temperature. Sometimes this is referred to as night sweats if it occurs at night.
Vaginal dryness - Hormone contributes to the natural lubrication of the vaginal walls. Lubrication decreases or diminishes with menopause or age
Osteoporosis - HRT has been proven to lower the risk of broken bones
Mood swings - Hormone therapy has been proven to lower the episodes of anxiety and depression in women
Colon cancer - Studies have shown with HRT, colon cancer rates are lower
Dental care - Because the risk of bone loss has decreased, tooth loss has been lowered as well.

, Hormone replacement comes in several forms. The forms are creams, patches, sprays, pills, tablets, vaginal rings and gels.


Pills, gels and creams are time released for the best benefit and are taken or applied daily
Patches are applied one to two times a week

, As with any medication, there are benefits and risks. Studies have shown that the major risks for patients taking HRT are high blood pressure, strokes, headaches, nausea, mood swings, bloating, blood clots, gallbladder disease and water retention.

, Most insurance companies cover the cost of HRT with the exception of the normal co-pay that is paid by the patient. The costs will range from $5 to $40 per month depending on the method used, manufacturer and your health prescription plan.

, There are some medications that have a harmful effect if combined.

However, you’ll need to keep your hands still throughout the practice.Watching TV or listening to the radio are great things to do while practicing a mudra. The length of the show can help you keep track of the time you spend in the mudra.
Some practitioners believe that meditating while performing a mudra increases its benefits. So you may prefer to limit distractions.
30 minutes per day is recommended for maximum benefits.;
, There are many mudras. Each one corresponds to a different element of the body, and each performs a different function. There are several mudras that people practice for thyroid disorders.


Use prana mudra for hyperthyroidism.Use prithvi mudra for hypothyroidism, This is the base of most mudras. Relax the hands and let the thumbs touch the correct spot with gentle pressure. Strong pressure is not important. Let any other fingers relax.Always perform mudras with both hands at the same time.
For prithvi mudra the thumb tip touches tip of ring finger.For prana mudra the thumb tip touches tips of ring finger and pinky together., There are multiple mudras that can be practiced for thyroid health. You may add them whenever you want for additional benefits.


Gyan mudra is also recommended for hypothyroidism. For this mudra, touch the thumb tip to the tip of the index finger.Vayu mudra is also recommended for hyperthyroidism. For this mudra, cross the thumb over the middle digit of your index finger., Add or subtract mudras as needed. You can also increase the amount of time you spend in the mudras. However, always practice each mudra for 30 minutes, if possible. This can enhance the benefits. If you're going to add mudras, do not shorten the amount of time you spend in each one.

, Yoga poses are great compliments to mudras. Many yoga poses are designed to encourage a healthy thyroid.Sarvangasana is highly recommended for thyroid health. This pose is also known as shoulder stand. You can practice this pose for one to two minutes per day.
Other useful poses are Halasana (plow pose), Bhujangasana (cobra pose), Viparita Karani (Inverted Pose), Janu Sirsasana (One legged forward bend), Matsyasana (Fish Pose), Marjariasana (Cat Stretch), and Ushtrasana (camel pose). You can practice each of these poses for one to two minutes per day.

, Take it easy, and do your best. If the pose feels like a strain, do less.

, Yoga benefits the entire body. Taking a full yoga class can incorporate these poses with others. Most yoga classes are 60 to 90 minutes long. However, even practicing for a few minutes per day can provide benefits., In addition to the yoga postures, you can add various breathing techniques to your practice. Try adding about 10 to 15 minutes of one or more breathing technique to your daily yoga practice, such as:



Kapal Bhati also known as skull shining breathing technique, which is when you take in a slow deep breath through your nostrils pulling the breath into your chest and belly. Then, you expel the breath somewhat forcefully through your nostrils again.Nadi Shodhan also known as alternate nostril breathing, which is when you place one finger over your right nostril and breathe in and then switch your finger to the left nostril and breathe out., Thyroid disorders can develop gradually, and the symptoms can be subtle.This can make diagnosis difficult. If you suspect you might have a thyroid disorder, keep track of your symptoms. If you have symptoms consistently for a few weeks, you may have a thyroid disorder.Hypothyroidism symptoms include muscular weakness, constant fatigue, a slow heartbeat, sensitivity to cold, and slow mental processing.Hyperthyroidism symptoms include a quick, strong heartbeat, muscular weakness, restlessness, anxiety, and weight loss despite a healthy appetite.Thyroid cancer is not very common but is still a concern. A notable symptom is a nodule (a localized swelling) in the thyroid gland.

, Medical reference sites often contain questionnaires about symptoms. These questionnaires can help assess the likelihood that you have a thyroid disorder.Once you fill out a questionnaire, you can bring it to your doctor for a consultation.

, Laboratory tests can be performed to confirm a thyroid disorder. Ask your doctor to have you tested for any likely disorders.Most patients who develop a lump or nodule in the thyroid actually have normal thyroid function. Laboratory tests can determine if nodules are malignant and need to be removed.
Repeated laboratory tests can also help monitor a patient’s progress throughout treatment.

, Your doctor can advise you about the need medication or therapy beyond the practice of mudras. They might prescribe oral medication or other kinds therapy.Beta-blockers are commonly used to decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These medications can take several months to take full effect and have possible side effects such as rashes on the skin and lower white blood cell counts.
Some patients instead choose to have radioactive iodine-131 treatment.
Thyroid cancer may require surgery. This can sometimes involve removal of the thyroid itself.

, When used in conjunction with your Yoga Mudra and medical treatments, proper nutrition may help to improve thyroid conditions. You can ask your doctor or visit a dietitian for some specific recommendations about what you should and should not eat.


For hyperthyroid conditions, include berries, broccoli, foods rich in vitamin D and Omega 3’s, and lean meats such as turkey.

For hypothyroid conditions, focus on fish, nuts, whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and beans.

Rule out other possible conditions.,
Get a specific diagnosis.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Treat Vulvodynia1," You will need to discuss your symptoms with either your primary care doctor or a gynecologist. Don’t be embarrassed to talk about the pain you are experiencing. You need to make sure the pain is not caused by another medical problem before you attempt to treat it.


Vulvodynia has only one primary symptom – vulva pain. This pain is described differently by different women. It may feel like itching, burning, aching, throbbing, stinging or stabbing in the areas around the labia, clitoris or vaginal opening. It can come and go and be affected by touch or pressure.
Some women with vulvodynia experience pain only during particular times – while exercising, for example, or during sexual intercourse.;
, If your doctor suspects you may have vulvodynia, he or she will probably perform an examination of your vulva area. There are also a few procedures and tests that the doctor may perform. These procedures can help pinpoint any problems that may be aggravating your symptoms.


It is common for your doctor to order blood tests to check hormone levels, such as estrogen, progesterone and testosterone.
The doctor will probably perform a cotton swab test. He or she will use a cotton swab to put gentle pressure on various locations of the vulva. You’ll be asked to describe any pain this test produces and rate its severity.If any particular parts of your vulva appear to be especially painful, or if the skin looks inflamed or suspicious for any reason, your doctor may decide to take a biopsy., Vulvodynia is diagnosed only after a doctor excludes other diseases and conditions that may produce pain of the vulva. Your doctor may test you for sexually transmitted infections, skin disorders, yeast infections, hormone imbalances and other conditions that could be responsible for your symptoms. If all of these conditions are ruled out, he or she may diagnose you with vulvodynia.

, There are two kinds of vulvodynia: vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and dysesthetic vulvodynia. Your doctor will diagnose you with one or the other, depending on what your symptoms are. Be sure to give your doctor as much information as possible.


Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS) means you have a painful response to pressure or touch around the vaginal opening. Women with this type of vulvodynia usually experience pain during sexual intercourse, tampon insertion, gynecological exams and at any other time that pressure is placed on the vestibule (the area around the vaginal opening).
Dysesthetic vulvodynia (DV) means you have a generalized pain of the vulvar area, which may affect the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, perineum, anus, mons pubis, urethra and/or inner thighs. It can happen suddenly, and while the pain is usually present to some degree, symptoms can come and go. Touch or pressure does not usually cause the pain but can make the symptoms worse., If you don’t think your doctor is taking your symptoms seriously, find a different one. Some doctors do not understand that vulvodynia is a real problem that isn't just in your head. You need a medical specialist who will listen to you, support you and help you find the treatments that work for you. Be persistent in pursuing a diagnosis, and don’t give up.

Try topical medications.,
Ask your doctor about hormonal treatments.,
Consider antidepressants.,
Ask about anticonvulsant medications.,
Use additional medications as needed.,
Discuss surgical treatment with your doctor.",How to Treat Vulvodynia2," Local anesthetics may provide temporary pain relief from your symptoms. You can use ointment with 5% lidocaine applied in a thin layer several times a day as needed. EMLA cream, which is 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine, is generally applied in a thin layer 15-20 minutes before sexual activity to prevent pain.


Do not apply local anesthetics to broken or irritated skin.
Local anesthetics will increase the likelihood of condom failure because the alcohol in the anesthetic can cause latex to tear. Make sure you and your partner have been tested for sexually transmitted infections, and use a back-up method of birth control.
Patients with long standing vulvodynia that does not respond to local anesthetics may get relief from receiving a nerve block.Talk to your doctor about getting evaluated for a nerve block and see a trained anesthesiologist if you are considering this option.

, Some patients with vulvodynia find relief with estrogen tablets or creams.Applying estrogen products can relieve pain, itching, dryness, redness, urinary symptoms and pain during sexual intercourse.


Estrogen therapy can be helpful for vulvar pain caused by atrophy (thinning of tissues and drying out).Your doctor may recommend a 1% estradiol cream if other estrogen measures are not as helpful. However, some medications, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCP), can cause atrophic changes and lead to increased pain.

, Antidepressant medications are sometimes used successfully to treat chronic pain conditions that do not have a clear cause, such as vulvodynia.Your doctor may suggest antidepressants (typically tricyclic antidepressants, or TCAs, which alter the way that the neurotransmitters in your brain transmit the signal of pain) as a possible treatment for vulvodynia.


Amitriptyline, a TCA, is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for vulvodynia. Generally, patients start with a small dose of 10 milligrams taken orally at night. This dose is increased by 10 milligrams per week until you achieve an effective dose (never exceeding 150 milligrams). Your doctor will likely recommend that you stay at the effective dose for 3 months before tapering off the medication. In some women, the symptoms of vulvodynia do not reappear after treatment.
Be aware of antidepressant side effects. Side effects of TCAs include drowsiness, weakness, fatigue, dry mouth, headache and constipation. Notify your physician if these effects persist or worsen. Always seek immediate medical attention if you experience rashes, itching, swelling or difficulty in breathing while taking any medication.
Effexor and Cymbalta (a separate class of drugs) have also been used for vulvodynia treatment.

, Anticonvulsant medications can work to manage chronic pain conditions, including vulvodynia.The most commonly prescribed medication in this class is called gabapentin. It works by altering the transmission of pain signals in the brain.


Gabapentin dosages can vary considerably. Patients usually start with 300 milligrams orally each day, then gradually increase to reach an effective dose (never take more than 3600 milligrams a day). Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, unsteadiness and fever. Notify your physician if these effects persist or worsen.
Other medications include pregabalin which is similar to gabapentin. It is approved for postherpetic neuralgia it is now being used as an off-label drug for vulvar pain. Your doctor may start you on 50 mg of pregabalin three times a day. Your doctor may increase your dose to as much as 600 mg per day divided in three doses, if you tolerate the drug and it is helping.

, Your doctor may suggest that you try corticosteroids or antihistamines if you have itching, swelling or inflammation.You may also be prescribed fluconazole to treat any yeast infections. Talk to your doctor to be sure that you are taking all your medications safely.

, Surgery should only be considered when every possible alternative diagnosis has been ruled out and all other treatment options for vulvodynia have been exhausted. Furthermore, it may only be effective for women with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome.


See multiple specialists. Many physicians may not be well-versed in all treatment options for vulvodynia. See a second (and even a third) physician before agreeing to try surgery.
Consider a vestibulectomy. If you have tried all other treatment options and sought a second opinion, you might consider a surgery called vestibulectomy.This procedure involves the removal of the painful tissues of the vaginal vestibule (the area around the vaginal opening). This surgery is usually performed under either spinal or general anesthesia.

Find a physical therapist.,
Try biofeedback.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Find a counselor.,
Consider cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT).,
Get support.",How to Treat Vulvodynia3," Ask your doctor or gynecologist for a referral to a physical therapist with experience treating vulvodynia. A good physical therapist can use gentle manual manipulation to help you strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and deal with tension and pain.


Some patients find that physical therapy alone reduces or eliminates their symptoms. However, you can certainly try physical therapy in combination with medication and other treatment options.

, Biofeedback therapy is a technique in which patients learn to control and manipulate physical processes that usually occur involuntarily. Through biofeedback, patients with vulvodynia can learn to contract and relax the pelvic floor muscles voluntarily. This allows the patient more control over the way this area of the body responds to pain signals.


Some patients find relief with biofeedback alone, but you can also combine the technique with medication or other treatment options.

, Acupuncture is a medical technique that involves inserting very thin needles into specific points on your body. There is some evidence that it can relieve acute and chronic pain. It has been used to treat migraines, muscle problems, neurological conditions, reproductive ailments and rheumatic diseases. Some patients with vulvodynia report that acupuncture relieves symptoms., Counseling can provide an important source of support, increasing your knowledge about your condition, helping you develop coping mechanisms and giving you a place to express your feelings about your condition. Vulvodynia can be stressful and upsetting, affecting your quality of life by limiting activities and making sexual and romantic relationships difficult. Counseling will help you deal with all of this.


Note that counseling tends to be non-directive. Your counselor will listen to you and help you make your own decisions, but he or she will not typically give direct advice or suggest particular treatment options.

, CBT is a specific form of counseling that focuses on practical coping strategies.A cognitive-behavioral therapist will help you understand the way that you think, feel and act. He or she will then offer strategies for modifying your behaviors. For patients with vulvodynia, this can be an effective tool for dealing with symptoms.


There is evidence that cognitive-behavior therapy, when adapted particularly for women with vulvodynia, can help you take control of your pain. This self-management therapy allows you to recognize the connection between your thoughts, feelings and behaviors regarding pain, sexuality and emotional function.

, In addition to counseling, consider other forms of support, such as support groups in your area or an online support group. It can be helpful to find others dealing with the same problem. Check your local hospital for information on support groups nearby.

Eat a diet high in probiotics.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Reduce activities that put pressure on your vulva.,
Try cold compresses.,
Choose lubricants with care.,
Take a sitz bath (a sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing purposes.,
Consider trying a low-oxalate diet.",How to Treat Vulvodynia4," Daily probiotics have been shown to fight many digestive tract and genital tract infections. They can help to maintain a healthy level of good bacteria in your vagina and this may prevent infections.For patients with vulvodynia, a diet rich in probiotics may help fight inflammation and infections.


Foods rich in probiotics include yogurt, kefir and sour cream. Look for yogurt that contains live and active cultures. You can also take probiotic supplements.
In addition, you can also consume foods rich with pectin. Foods high in pectin enhance the work of probiotics by making digestion work more smoothly. Apples and citrus fruits are the best sources but berries, peaches, apricots, cherries and grapes are also high in pectin.

, Wash your vulva with gentle, unscented soaps and rinse well.If urinating seems to increase your symptoms, rinse your vulva with cool water after you go to the bathroom.Avoid irritants. Replace any scented soaps, sprays and lotions with unscented, chemical-free products. Similarly, replace nylon underwear (which traps moisture and can irritate your skin) with 100% cotton.

, Some activities, such as bicycling and horseback riding, can trigger vulvar pain.Pay attention to physical activities that seem connected to your symptoms. Once you know which activities are contributing to the problem, try to avoid them as much as possible.

, Applying a cold compress can also help with vulvar pain.Cold slows down blood flow and circulation. This can reduce pain and inflammation. Make a cold compress by wrapping ice in a towel or cloth and applying it to the affected area.


Never apply ice directly to your skin.

, Lubricants can help with vulvar pain during sex.If you are able to have sexual intercourse, look for a water-soluble lubricant rather than an oil-based lubricant. Oil-based lubricant may contain chemicals that can aggravate your symptoms. Avoid any lubricants with added sugars or glycerin because these can also irritate your skin.

, the water covers only your hips and buttocks) with oatmeal or baking soda. Oatmeal contains anti-inflammatory substances called avenanthramides. These substances can reduce pain, irritation and itchiness. Also try baking soda--it is alkaline and can help regulate vaginal pH levels. This may correct excess acidity that can contribute to itching and burning.


For an oatmeal bath, dissolve one sachet of powdered oatmeal into your bathwater and bathe for 20 minutes.
For a baking soda bath, mix 4 to 5 tablespoons (59.1 to 73.9 ml) of baking soda into your bathwater and bathe for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Oxalates are compounds found in plant foods that bind to minerals and reduce their absorption.Some doctors recommend a low oxalate diet for vulvodynia because foods high in oxalates can produce urine that is irritating, and this may contribute to vulvar pain.Talk to your doctor about your urine oxalate levels, and consider modifying your diet accordingly.


Foods high in oxalates include chocolate, berries, spinach and nuts.
You can also take a calcium citrate supplement. Calcium citrate may inhibit the growth of oxalate crystals, relieving pain and itching. Consider taking 200-250 milligrams of calcium citrate 3 times daily.

Instead, Bright's disease as a diagnosis has been superseded by the contemporary medical terms ""nephritis"" or ""glomerulonephritis"" (GN).The term Bright's disease is most often found today by people researching their genealogy.;
, There are two types of GN: acute and chronic. Acute GN may be caused by some other illness like strep throat or Wegener's disease.Chronic GN can run in families, but often the cause is not known. A person may suffer an acute attack and then develop chronic GN later on. Other causes may include:Lupus
Bacterial endocarditis
Viral infections (such as (HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C)
Goodpasture's syndrome
Polyarteritis
Diabetic kidney disease
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

, Chronic kidney diseases affect the kidney's ability to function at a normal, healthy level. The loss of kidney function has subsequent effects on the rest of the body, including the body's ability to:Filter waste out of the blood
Maintain normal blood pressure
Produce vitamin D
Produce erythropoietin, which helps produce red blood cells

, GN has some variance of symptoms, depending on the particular causes and conditions of the disease; however, the typical symptoms include:Pink or cola-tinted urine, caused by red blood cells in the urine
Foam in the urine caused by excessive protein content
High blood pressure
Fluid retention, especially in the face, hands, feet, and abdomen
Weight gain (mainly caused by fluid retention)
Fatigue, usually accompanied by anemia and/or kidney failure

, In addition to the presence of telling physical symptoms, there are a number of tests that can confirm a diagnosis of GN. Common tests include the following:Urine analysis to check for red and white blood cells, increased protein levels, or increased levels of creatinine and urea
Blood tests to measure for levels of waste products like creatinine and blood urea nitrogen
Ultrasound
Biopsy of the kidney

, Kidney disease is categorized as a chronic and progressive disease. Each stage of the disease is marked by its own symptoms and the gradual loss of kidney function, measured by the kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).The stages of kidney disease are:Stage one — Marked by mild symptoms and normal GFR of at least 90 percent of normal kidney function.
Stage two — Marked by mild symptoms and reduced GFR, with the gradual reduction of kidney function to between 60 and 89 percent of normal function.
Stage three — Marked by moderate symptoms and significantly reduced GFR, with kidney function ranging between 40 and 59 percent of normal function.
Stage four — Marked by severe symptoms and drastically reduced GFR, with kidney function ranging between 15 and 29 percent of normal function.
Stage five — The kidneys operate at less than 15 percent of normal function.

, Because many cases of GN are caused by underlying conditions, your treatment plan may include treating those conditions. This treatment plan will vary, depending on what conditions are causing your kidney disease.Talk to your doctor about your condition, and understand how it may impact your kidney health.

, Medications like corticosteroids can help decrease immune system responses like inflammation, which is a common problem for people with kidney diseases and disorders;however, corticosteroid use carries the risk of significant side effects, including increased appetite/weight gain, sudden and significant mood swings, delayed healing of injuries, weakened bones, diabetes, and high blood pressure., Chronic kidney diseases often affect the body's ability to regulate its blood pressure. Because of this, many treatment plans include taking blood pressure medication. In addition to regulating the body's blood pressure, these medications can also reduce the amount of protein released through your urine, which may help you manage the symptoms of the disease.Common blood pressure medications prescribed to treat kidney diseases like GN include benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), and enalapril (Vasotec).Some doctors may also prescribe angiotensin II receptor blockers like losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan) to achieve similar results., Diuretics like water pills can help reduce water retention. Decreasing water retention will help manage swelling in the body and can increase your kidneys' ability to function by increasing water output.Common water pills prescribed for kidney diseases include furosemide (Lasix) and spironolactone (Aldactone)., Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants, reduce your blood's ability to form clots, which may help prevent blood clots in your body (specifically the kidneys).This may help manage the symptoms of kidney disease and improve your kidneys' ability to function.


Common anticoagulants prescribed to treat kidney diseases include heparin and warfarin (Coumadin)., The efficacy of taking cholesterol medication (also known as statins) for kidney disease is unclear; however, some studies suggest that taking cholesterol medications may help reduce the risk of death in some people.Commonly-prescribed statins for people with kidney diseases include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), and lovastatin (Altoprev, Mevacor)., There is no known way to prevent all types of kidney disease. But some studies suggest that practicing good hygiene — including engaging in safe sex and refraining from intravenous drug use — may help prevent viral infections (such as hepatitis and HIV) that could eventually lead to chronic kidney disease., Some people find that making dietary changes can help manage some of the symptoms of GN. Common dietary recommendations for people with kidney diseases include:Choosing lean protein over fatty proteins
Lowering the overall consumption of fat and cholesterol in the diet
Maintaining a low-salt diet
Reducing potassium in the diet
Maintaining a healthy, manageable body weight
Avoiding smoking

, Changing your gut culture to have healthy and beneficial bacteria is seen as a good way to improve the digestive enzymes and be able to detoxify trimethylamine in the system.

, There has been mixed success at reducing TMAU symptoms by taking vitamin B2, zinc, kelp pills, or copper chlorophyllin.

, Coffee and beer have been reported to increase the odor issues of those with TMAU.

, Find soaps for the body that are have pH level of between 5.5-6.5 which should help to break down or wash away trimethylamine on the body's surface. Also use the same level detergents for washing clothes.

, Sweating too much doesn't help. Also staying calm is a good idea.

, People who are overweight may have additional stress on their body which can make it more difficult for the body to work efficiently. For instance, a fatty liver will make it more difficult to eliminate waste/toxins from the system. A lighter person who follows a good diet also usually has a better digestive system and a lot more beneficial bacteria.

, When deciding on a healthy lifestyle change, it may take time for it to have an impact on your body. Significant changes may not be noticed until 6 months later in some people taking action to reduce their systems.

, Everybody's body reacts differently according to what they eat. Some people may have more adverse reactions to milk products, wheat, beans, seafood etc. Try to eliminate what makes you stomach rumble and your body sweat more.

Antibiotics, usually penicillin, are commonly given to infants and young children (but also adults in some cases), to help prevent bacterial infections.Infants with sickle cell anemia can begin taking antibiotics at about 2 months old and often continue for the first 5 years of life.
Infants need to take liquid penicillin, whereas older children and adults can take the pills — usually twice daily.
The most common life-threatening infection related to sickle cell anemia is bacterial pneumonia.;
, In addition to often feeling tired and fatigued from lack of oxygen in your bloodstream, episodes of severe pain are commonly experienced by people with sickle cell anemia.To manage these periodic episodes of pain, often called sickle cell crises, take over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for a day or so until the crisis resolves itself. The painful episodes can last for a few hours or even a few weeks at a time.


Moderate-to-severe pain occurs when the sickle-shaped red blood cells reduce or block bloodflow within the smaller blood vessels in the chest, abdomen and limbs.
The pain tends to be felt more in the joints and bones — in other words, it's typically a deeper pain a than superficial one.
For especially severe episodes that last for more than a few days, your doctor might prescribe a stronger medication, such as opiate drugs.

, Applying heating pads or moist herbal bags to your body during painful sickle cell episodes might help as the heat tends to open up (dilate) blood vessels and allow the sickle-shaped red blood cells to pass through.Moist heat is a better choice over electric heating pads because it tends not to dry out your skin. Use microwavable bags filled with some type of grain (bulgur wheat or rice), herbs and essential oils.


Heat the herbal bag in your microwave for about two minutes or so and apply it to your achy joints, bones or abdomen for at least 15 minutes, three to five times daily.
Adding lavender or other soothing essential oils to your herbal bag can help reduce the discomfort and anxiety caused by your sickle cell crisis.
Taking a bath is another good source of moist heat. Add 2 cups of Epsom salt to the hot water for best results — the magnesium in the salt can further soothe your achy body.
Ice and cold compresses should be avoided as they may cause sickling.

, Red blood cells are made within the bone marrow of your long bones and require certain nutrients to be produced regularly. One of the most important nutrients for making and replacing red blood cells is folate (vitamin B9), which is also called folic acid when in supplement form.As such, if you have sickle cell anemia, take folic acid supplements daily and/or regularly eat foods rich in folate.


Vitamins B6 and B12 are also important for healthy red blood cell production and possibly triggering anti-sickling behavior.
Good sources of these B vitamins include: meats, oily or fatty fish, poultry, most whole grains, fortified cereals, soybeans, avocados, baked potatoes (with skins), watermelon, bananas, peanuts and brewer's yeast.Recommended daily dosages of folic acid range from 400 to 1,000 mcg (micrograms).
Multi-vitamins (without iron) may also be recommended.

, When taken regularly, hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) is a drug that helps to decrease painful sickle cell anemia crises and it may also reduce the need for blood transfusions in some moderate-to-severe cases.Hydroxyurea likely stimulates the production of fetal hemoglobin in children and adults, which helps to prevent the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells.


Hydroxyurea is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent pain episodes in sickle cell disease.
Fetal hemoglobin naturally occurs in newborns, but they quickly lose the ability to produce it within a few weeks or months.
Hydroxyurea was first used only for adults with severe sickle cell anemia, but now more doctors are giving it to children with good results.Be cautious of potential side effects, which include a greater risk of infection and a possible link to leukemia (cancer of the blood). Ask your doctor if you or your child is a good candidate for hydroxyurea.

, If you have sickle cell anemia, there are a number of evaluations and screenings that are important in treating the condition and minimizing complications.Get a dilated eye examination, beginning at age 10, to check for sickle retinopathy. If test results are normal, get re-screened every one to two years. If results are abnormal, follow up with a retinal specialist.
Get tested for renal disease starting at age 10. If the result is negative tests should be done once yearly. If the result is positive, a follow-up test must be performed.
Regularly monitor blood pressure. Even slight increases in blood pressure can increase the risk of stroke in patients with sickle cell disease.

, Without enough oxygen in your bloodstream, your body feels tired, without energy and chronically fatigued — sometimes making it a chore to get out of bed in the morning. Supplemental oxygen, via a mask attached to a pressurized bottle of oxygen, can help you through a crisis or even day-to-day living, much like patients with severe emphysema do.Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of using supplemental oxygen for sickle cell anemia.


Breathing in supplemental oxygen won't force the sickle-shaped red blood cells to carry it, but it can saturate other healthy red blood cells and maximize what gets delivered to other tissues in your body.
Supplemental oxygen typically has a higher oxygen content than normal air at sea level. If you travel to higher elevations, carrying supplemental oxygen may avoid a sickle cell crisis until your body can adapt to the new conditions.

, Another type of treatment that deals more directly with replacing sickle cells with healthy cells is a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions introduce a high number normal red blood cells into circulation, which helps to relieve the symptoms created by the sickle cells.Healthy red blood cells live longer than sickle cells in the bloodstream, up to 120 days. In comparison, sickle cells tend to live no longer than 20 days.


In children and adults with severe sickle cell anemia and at high risk of stroke from blocked arteries, regular blood transfusions can reduce their risk significantly.
Regular blood transfusions have their own risks. They can increase the likelihood of infections and cause too much iron to build up in the body, which can damage internal organs such as the heart and liver.If you have sickle cell anemia and undergo regular red blood cell transfusions, ask your doctor about deferasirox (Exjade) — a medication that reduces excess iron levels in the body.

, People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their bloodstream, which normally keeps blood vessels dilated (opened up) and reduces the ""stickiness"" of red blood cells.Ask your doctor about getting treated with nitric oxide because it may prevent sickle-shaped cells from clumping together and clogging smaller arteries — studies have had mixed results on effectiveness.


Treatment involves inhaling nitric oxide gas, although it's difficult to administer and your doctor may not feel comfortable with the procedure.
A supplement that may increase blood levels of nitric oxide is called arginine, an amino acid. Arginine is safe to supplement with and has no known side effects.

, A bone marrow transplant (or stem cell transplant) involves replacing the affected bone marrow with healthy marrow from an appropriately matched donor.It's a lengthy and risky hospital procedure that involves destroying all the bone marrow in the anemic person with radiation or chemotherapy, then injecting them with stem cells from a donor. It is the only available curative option for sickle cell disease. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons and if you're a candidate for it.


Not every person with sickle cell anemia is a candidate for a bone marrow transplant and matching donors can be difficult to find.
Only about 10% of children with sickle cell anemia have matched donors with healthy stem cells in their families.Risks of a bone marrow transplant are numerous and include life-threatening infections due to a destroyed immune system.
Because of the risks, transplantation is typically recommended only for people who have severe and chronic symptoms related to sickle cell anemia.

, This is of great importance in patients with sickle cell anemia. They are highly susceptible to viral and bacterial infections due to the loss of spleen function that often occurs in early childhood; therefore, in addition to prophylactic antibiotics in childhood, immunization against some diseases are also key. These include the standard childhood vaccinations, as well as immunizations against influenza, bacterial meningitis and certain types of pneumonia.

, There is less oxygen at higher altitudes, which can quickly trigger a sickle cell crisis if your body isn't used to such conditions.As such, be cautious if traveling to high-altitude areas (mountainous regions) and consider using supplemental oxygen if you do go.


Consult with your doctor before any trips to high-altitude areas and balance the benefits against the health risks.
Only fly on airplanes with pressurized cabins (which includes all commercial flights on larger planes) and avoid flying in smaller, unpressurized aircrafts at high altitudes.

, It's important to keep your blood volume up, especially if you have sickle cell anemia. Low blood volume (common with dehydration) makes the blood thicker and more likely to stick or clump together and can trigger a sickle cell crisis.Prevent dehydration by drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses (about 2 liters) of purified water per day.


Avoid drinking liquids with caffeine, which acts as a diuretic (makes you urinate more frequently) and can reduce blood volume.
Caffeine is found in coffee, black tea, chocolate, most soda pop, and virtually all energy drinks.
Increase the amount of fluids you drink per day if you exercise a fair bit or spend time in a hotter climate.

, Another possible trigger for a sickle cell crisis is temperature extremes — either getting too hot or too cold.Getting too hot increases sweating and can lead to dehydration and low blood volume. Getting too cold causes blood vessels to constrict (get smaller), which hampers blood circulation.


Stick to places and vehicles with air conditioning if you find yourself in a hot and/or humid environment. Wear clothes made of natural fibers (cotton) that can breath.
Keep yourself warm in cold climates by wearing layers of insulated clothing, such as wool. Keeping your hands warm by wearing gloves is especially important for people with sickle cell anemia.

, Heavy-duty physical demands on your body increase its need for oxygen, which can trigger a sickle cell crisis because there's not enough hemoglobin to carry the oxygen to needy cells.Wile some regular exercise is good for health and circulation, avoid the strenuous stuff, such as long-distance jogging, cycling and swimming.


Instead, focus on low-impact exercises such as walking, light aerobics, yoga and non-strenuous yard work.
Lifting light-to-medium weights is okay to build and maintain muscle, but heavy lifting is not recommended for people with sickle cell anemia.

Maintain a whole-food, organic diet.,
Avoid foods that can negatively affect your thyroid if you are hypothyroid.,
Do not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco products.,
Use stress management techniques like deep breathing and yoga.,
Do 30 minutes of exercise a day.",How to Treat Thyroid Problems1," Though it is not possible to cure your thyroid issues by adjusting your diet, changes to your diet can benefit your thyroid in positive ways. To maintain your health when you have thyroid issues, you should have foods that are not processed or prepackaged, as they can contain additives and preservatives that can irritate your thyroid. Go for whole-foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables as well as whole grain foods. Make sure all the produce you consume is organic and preferably, fresh or homemade.You should try to integrate seaweed or kelp into your meals if you are iodine deficient due to your thyroid issues. However, you should not have more than 158 to 175 micrograms of kelp a day. Avoid taking kelp capsules or a surplus of kelp, as too much iodine in your system can cause issues.;
, If you have hypothyroid, where your thyroid is underactive, you should avoid or limit your consumption of certain foods that can affect your thyroid. Vegetables like cabbage, turnips, Brussels sprouts, rutabagas, broccoli, cauliflower and bok choy can all interfere with your thyroid’s ability to take in iodine.


Do not have soy products if you have hypothyroidism, as soy can hinder your body’s ability to absorb hormones that can help your thyroid function properly.You should also avoid cassava, a root vegetable popular in Caribbean cooking. Cassava is known to produce toxins that can slow down an underactive thyroid.If you have hyperthyroidism, you should increase your intake of these vegetables, as they can help to counter an overactive thyroid.

, These substances can have a negative effect on your thyroid. You should also avoid certain drugs such as Lithium, Thionamides, Alpha Interferon, Interleukin-2, Cholestyramine, Perchlorate, Expectorants, Aluminum hydroxide and Raloxifene.


If you are not sure if the medications you are taking are safe for use while smoking or drinking alcohol, you should talk to your doctor.

, Stress can cause thyroid problems to get worse. Try to do one stress management technique a day, such as deep breathing exercises, yoga, and tai chi.



Deep breathing exercises can be done at home in a quiet, secluded area or at your desk with your office door closed. Take a comfortable seated position in your chair or on the floor. Practice inhaling deeply through your nose for four counts and then exhaling through your nose for four counts. Try to deep breathe with your eyes closed and your body relaxed for five to ten minutes a day.
You can also do yoga poses that focus on relaxation, such as corpse posture, where you lay on your back with your eyes closed and your body relaxed. You can also take a relaxation yoga class, which will focus on poses that will encourage your body to de-stress., A moderate amount of cardio exercise is also recommended for individuals with thyroid issues. Squeeze in a 20-30 minute walk or jog one a day. You can also do 30 minutes of cardio machines at the gym.


Exercising will help your body stay healthy and encourage your thyroid to function properly. Doing 30 minutes of exercise a day can also help your body to de-stress and allow you to burn off any feelings of anxiety.

Take supplements if you do not consume enough vitamins and minerals in your diet.,
Have daily mineral supplements.,
Take daily vitamin supplements.,
Have anti-inflammatory botanical supplements.,
Get a prescription for thyroid replacement hormones from your doctor.,
Consume the replacement hormones on an empty stomach.",How to Treat Thyroid Problems2," It can be tricky to balance the vitamins and minerals present in your diet with any vitamin or mineral supplements you are taking. You should monitor your vitamin and mineral levels on a constant basis to ensure you are not absorbing too much of a certain vitamin or mineral, as this can cause health problems.For example, iodine supplements are useful for individuals with hypothyroidism who do not consume iodized salt in their diet or any other sources of iodized salt, such as seafood or fast food. You may be low in iodine and require iodine through supplements as there is not enough iodine in your diet.
If you do eat iodized salt and foods that contain iodized salt, you may not need iodine supplements as too much iodine can cause adverse health issues. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements for your thyroid problems.

, If you are suffering from hypothyroidism, you should consider taking minerals like iodine, selenium, and zinc. These minerals can help your thyroid get the minerals and vitamins it needs to function properly. Look for high quality mineral supplements from health food stores or supplement stores, as this will ensure you are taking supplements that contain enough minerals.You can take iodine supplements (150-1500 mcg/day) or have ½ teaspoon of iodized table salt a day.
Take selenium supplements, 200-400 mcg/day.
You can also take zinc supplements, 20-40 mg/day and copper supplements, 4-5 mg/day. This will prevent copper deficiency., You should also integrate vitamin supplements into your daily routine to maintain your health and keep your energy levels up.Fish oils are anti-inflammatory and can help to reduce auto-antibodies present in your body due to hypothyroidism. Have 2-3 grams of omega-3 fish oils every day. If you have been diagnosed with a type of hypothyroidism called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, you can increase your intake of omega-3 fish oils to 3-4 grams a day.
Take 2-3 times the recommended daily amount of B-vitamins to help maintain high energy throughout the day.
You can also take 1000-2000 IU of vitamin D a day.
You can take anti-oxidants like beta-carotene (3-6 mg/day), vitamin C (1000-3000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400-8000 IU/day).

, You can also integrate botanical supplements into your diet or cook with botanicals to improve your health. For example, spices like turmeric, cayenne pepper, and ginger as well as healthy oils like olive oil can all be taken as supplements or used in cooking.


You can also take natural supplements like Boswellia, grape seed extract, green tea, and pycnogenol or Maritime Pine., A normally functioning thyroid will produce prohormones known as T4 or thyroxine, which is then converted to an active form known as T3 or triiodothyronine. If you have a thyroid problem and your thyroid is not working properly, your doctor should monitor your T4 and T3 levels on a regular basis. She may also recommend that you take thyroid replacement hormones to increase your T4 and T3 levels, allowing your thyroid to function more normally.Individuals with hypothyroidism can take thyroid replacement hormones to increase their T4 levels using synthetic T4, also known as Levothyroxine. You can also take synthetic T3, known as Liothyronine or Cytomel if you cannot convert T4 well in your body. Synthetic T3 is a good option for individuals who do not want to consume animal products or pork products.
Thyroid hormones can be derived from animal sources, primarily pig. Many bio-identical thyroid hormones contain dried pig thyroids. Talk to your doctor about hormones from animal sources, such as Armour, Erfa, and Nature-Throid, if you are concerned about using synthetic hormones.

, Your doctor should direct you to have your replacement thyroid hormones on an empty stomach to allow your body to absorb the thyroid properly. You should also avoid eating certain foods or foods that contain too much dietary fiber at the same time as you take the hormones, including:Walnuts
Soybean flour
Cottonseed meal
Iron supplements or multivitamins containing iron
Calcium supplements
Antacids that have aluminum or magnesium
Ulcer medications or drugs that can help to lower your cholesterol levels
Have these foods several hours before or several hours after consuming your replacement thyroid hormones to ensure there are no adverse reactions in your body to the hormones.

Do not take iodine supplements or consume iodized salt.,
Have mineral supplements.,
Take vitamin supplements.,
Add botanical supplements to your diet.",How to Treat Thyroid Problems3," If you have hyperthyroidism, your body is producing too much of the thyroid hormone. Iodine can irritate your thyroid and cause health issues, so it is not recommended for individuals with hyperthyroidism., You can take several mineral supplements once a day to help manage your hyperthyroidism, including:Selenium, 200-400 mcg/day
Zinc, 20-40 mg/day
Copper, 4-5 mg/day
Calcium: This mineral is especially important for individuals with Graves’ disease, a common disorder in people with hyperactive thyroids. Graves’ disease can cause brittle, weak bones or osteoporosis, and calcium supplements can help to reduce these risks., Start with a good, whole-food vitamin, which is derived from food rather than synthesized in a lab, and produced from food with very little processing. You can then take other vitamin supplements, including:2-3 grams of omega-3 fish oils every day. If you have Graves’ disease, you should aim for 3-4 grams of fish oil a day.
B-vitamins to increase your energy levels. Take two to three times the recommended daily amount of B-vitamins.
Anti-oxidant vitamins, such as vitamin C (2000 mg/day), vitamin E (400-800 IU/day), l-carnitine (2-4 g/day), and CoQ10 (50-100 mg/day). I-carnitine has been shown to reduce thyroid hormone production in your body. CoQ10 has been shown to be low in individuals with hyperthyroidism.

, Only take botanical supplements once you have consulted a qualified naturopathic physician. Several botanical supplements have been shown to block the production of thyroid hormones in your body, including:Lycopus spp (Bugleweed)Lithospermum officinaleMelissa officinalis (Lemon balm)Iris versicolorEmblica officinalis (Indian gooseberry)"

Use a liquid diet for severe inflammation.,
Take liquid nutrition for better absorption.,
Try the diet in place of corticosteroids.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Try a Liquid Diet for IBD1," A liquid diet is often prescribed by a doctor if you have severe inflammation. Usually, patients who go on this diet are waiting to have surgery done on their bowels to improve their situation, and the liquid diet is a temporary solution until surgery can happen. It is sometimes used after surgery, as well.You may also try a partially liquid diet during a flare-up.
Often, this diet is only used for about two to eight weeks at a time, depending on the type of diet.However, some people do need to use it for much longer. For instance, some people use it for a year or longer, though it may also cause you to lose weight.;
, People with IBS are often at risk of malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies, particularly if they have Crohn’s Disease or ulcerative colitis. A liquid diet can help you better absorb the nutrients your body needs. The liquid is composed of the base components of nutrition, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins, making it easier for those with IBD to absorb. Often, the proteins are broken down into component parts, which means your stomach has to work less to digest it.Think about it this way: normally, your mouth and stomach begin the process of breaking down large pieces of food. In the case of a liquid diet, it doesn't need to be broken down into smaller pieces because it's already liquid. In fact, sometimes this diet is used to skip the stomach altogether, through the use of a tube.
Children, especially, benefit from this treatment, as it ensures they get adequate nutrition even if they have a poor appetite.If you think you are at risk for malnutrition, speak with your doctor or nutritionist.

, Often, this diet is used in place of corticosteroids as a treatment. If you have sensitivity to these medications, for instance, this diet may be a better option. It can help control inflammation, though it may not put you in full remission.A liquid diet is beneficial because it can help reduce inflammation, calm a flare-up, and assist in nutrition absorption. In some cases, it may lead to a remission of the disease for a period of time.It also doesn't produce as much stool, making it easier for you to go to the bathroom., Before making a drastic diet change like going to a liquid diet, it's always best to discuss it with your doctor first. With IBD, your ability to absorb nutrients is reduced, and going to a liquid diet is a big change that many people have difficulty sticking to.When talking with your doctor, bring up why you think a liquid diet would be a good option for you. You could try, ""I've been having almost continuous flare-ups lately, and I was wondering if a liquid diet may help reduce those occurrences, at least in the short-term.""
If you're having flare-ups, your doctor can put you in contact with a nutritionist that may be able to help you tailor your diet to reduce flare-ups.

"
"
Discuss which liquid diet is most appropriate for you.,
Purchase an appropriate drink.,
Be ready for some discomfort.,
Stay exclusively on the prescribed diet.,
Try parenteral nutrition for severe cases.",How to Try a Liquid Diet for IBD2," Three types of liquids are used for this diet: elemental, semi-elemental, and polymeric. Elemental diets contain just amino acids (the building blocks of protein), while polymeric contain whole protein strands. Semi-elemental are somewhere in the middle. That means that elemental diets are the easiest to digest, but they also taste the worst of the three.Ask your doctor which would be the best option for you.

, Once you've narrowed down what kind of liquid diet you need, your doctor can recommend an appropriate brand. You can find these drinks at most drug stores and big box stores, so they are readily available.Some elemental brands include Vivonex, Tolerex, and Alitraq.
Some semi-elemental brands include Peptamen or Peptamen Junior, Optimental, Subdue, Perative, and Vital HN.
A few polymeric brands are Promote, Probalance, Replete, Jevity, and Isocal., You can take these diets by mouth; however, they are not the most tasty drinks. Polymeric tends to taste somewhat better than elemental diets. Nonetheless, you may find the drink unpleasant.You can take the diet through other methods. For instance, you can take it through a tube in your nose at night, though some people find it uncomfortable.In some cases, this type of diet may be taken through a tube that goes directly to the intestine or stomach.You may also experience other problems with this diet, such as nausea or diarrhea. A few people report skin rashes while on this type of diet, but those generally clear up. Also, in patients with diabetes, the diet may contain too much sugar, and insulin may need to be adjusted., For this diet to work well, you must exclude all other foods and liquids, with the exception of water. You'll be getting your nutrition solely from the liquid to give your bowels a chance to heal from the inflammation.In some cases, your doctor may prescribe these liquids as a supplement to your normal diet. Either way, the key is to stay on the diet as prescribed by your doctor or nutritionist.

, Sometimes, you may not even be able to use your digestive system to absorb nutrients. In that case, you can take nutrients right into your bloodstream, using an IV catheter. The mixture is still made up of the same base components; it just goes into your blood rather than into your digestive system.This method allows your bowels to be rested completely.

"
"
Try diluted juices.,
Skip the ice.,
Avoid caffeine.,
Slow down.,
Move up to solids.",How to Try a Liquid Diet for IBD3," One way to get some nutrients after a flare up is to drink juices that have been watered down a bit. Watered down is best because too much sugar can also cause irritation. However, the juices will provide you with some of the nutrients you need.Low-sugar sports drinks can also be beneficial.

, Although you may enjoy your drinks ice-cold, you may have better luck trying warmer beverages, such as room temperature. Ice-cold liquids can cause you to have cramps, making symptoms worse and causing you more pain., If possible, skip the caffeine altogether. Caffeine doesn't just boost your energy, it also gives a ""boost"" to your bowels. In other words, it can lead to diarrhea in people who already have bowel trouble, so it's best to avoid it., While you want to get plenty of fluids on a liquid diet, try not to gulp your beverages down. Instead, go a bit more slowly and avoid using a straw. Going too fast or using a straw introduces more air into your system, which can lead to you having extra gas and being uncomfortable., Once your doctor says it's okay, you can start slowly introducing solids, beginning with soft foods. Try adding one new food a day, so you don't overwhelm your system. You can begin with foods like applesauce and oatmeal.Other well-tolerated solids include plain poultry or fish, eggs, plain mashed potatoes, plain noodles, bread (white or sourdough), and canned fruits.

Stop the medication.,
Contact your physician if you’ve been taking your medication for a while.,
Take anti-serotonin medication.,
Contact emergency services if you experience the severe symptoms.,
Conduct any additional tests.",How to Treat Serotonin Syndrome1," If you have started a new medication or a new combination of medications and experience any of the milder symptoms listed, contact your doctor to talk about stopping the medication. If you cannot get in touch with your doctor, stop the medication until you talk to your doctor. For mild serotonin syndrome, the effects usually dissipate within one to three days.You should contact your doctor to let her know that you have stopped taking your medication. Your doctor may want to change you to a different medication.
You should only stop the medicine cold turkey if you have been on the medicine for less than a few weeks.;
, If you have been on your medication for more than a few weeks, you should contact your doctor before getting off the medication. Many antidepressants and other medications that cause serotonin syndrome have serious side effects if you stop taking them suddenly.Your doctor needs to discuss with you other options so you will know how best to take any needed medications.

, If your symptoms do not dissipate after a few days, you have been taking the medications that caused the serotonin syndrome for an extended period of time, or you are having any symptoms worrisome for severe serotonin syndrome (very high blood pressure, mental status changes, etc.), you need to seek medical attention immediately. You may need to take anti-serotonin medication to help treat the condition. A physician can prescribe these types of medications.if treated promptly and appropriately, the symptoms of serotonin syndrome usually resolve within 24 hours.Your doctor can monitor your symptoms to ensure that you are getting better.
One example of an anti-serotonin medication is cyproheptadine.

, If you have started a new medication or a new combination of medications and experience any of the more severe symptoms listed, stop the medication right away and contact emergency services. Experiencing the severe symptoms may mean that you are facing a potentially life-threatening condition. These severe symptoms can progress rapidly.Severe symptoms include high fever, seizures, an irregular heartbeat, and unconsciousness.
You may require hospital treatment for serious symptoms. You may be administered medications to block the action of serotonin, to relax the muscles, and to control heart rate and blood pressure. You may also be given oxygen therapy and IV fluids, along with any other assistance in breathing.

, There is no single lab test to diagnose serotonin syndrome. It is mostly diagnosed based on your symptoms and the medications you are taking; however, other disorders may need to be excluded, such as drug withdrawal, malignant hyperthermia, overdose, and others.To exclude these other conditions, your physician or the hospital attendants may order tests to check for the other disorders.

Check for symptoms of agitation.,
Monitor for confusion or lack of coordination.,
Watch for other bodily changes.,
Check for severe symptoms.,
Know that the symptoms can start within a few hours.",How to Treat Serotonin Syndrome2," Serotonin syndrome is essentially an over-excitation of the nervous system, so the symptoms reflect this. You may feel agitation, restlessness, or irritability. Because of this, you may experience an increased heart rate and palpitations. Your pupils may also be dilated and you may have increased blood pressure., Another common symptom of serotonin syndrome is confusion and disorientation. You may also experience pronounced clumsiness. Your muscles may feel uncoordinated, making it hard to walk, drive, or perform daily tasks.Your muscles may also end up feeling excessively rigid. You may also experience twitching muscles or muscle tics.

, If you have serotonin syndrome, you may also experience profuse sweating. Instead of sweating, you may experience shivering or have goosebumps break out over your body.You may also experience diarrhea or headaches.

, There are some symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome that indicate you are experiencing a serious reaction. These symptoms can be life-threatening, and if you experience them, you should call emergency services immediately. These symptoms include:High fever
Seizures
An irregular heartbeat
Unconsciousness
High blood pressure
Change in mental status

, The symptoms of serotonin syndrome usually begin within a few hours of taking a prescribed medication, an OTC medication, or an herbal supplement. These symptoms are even more common when one or more of these substances are combined.The majority of cases of serotonin syndrome happen within six to 24 hours of a change in dose or starting of a new drug.Serotonin syndrome can be serious and life-threatening, so if you are taking any of the medications listed or have just started a new medication and experience any of the symptoms, call your physician, emergency services, or go to an emergency room right away.

Learn the causes of serotonin syndrome.,
Prevent serotonin syndrome.,
Identify who is at risk.",How to Treat Serotonin Syndrome3," Any drug or substance that increases the amount of serotonin in the body (or decreases the breakdown of serotonin in the body) can cause dangerously high levels of serotonin in your blood and potentially cause serotonin syndrome. There are a number of drugs, mainly antidepressants, that can do this. This can happen especially if over-used intentionally or non-intentionally. Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when combining medication from different classes. These include:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): These are antidepressants and include drugs like citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).
Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): These are a class of antidepressants similar to the SSRIs and include drugs like trazodone, duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor).
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): This group includes antidepressants like isocarboxazid (Marplan) and phenelzine (Nardil).
Other antidepressants: These can include drugs like Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban), and the Tricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor).
Medications for migraines: This class includes the triptans (Axert, Amerge, Imitrex), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and valproic acid (Depakene).
Pain medications: These include drugs like cyclobenzaprine (Amrix and Fexmid), fentanyl (Duragesic), meperidine (Demerol), and tramadol (Ultram).
Mood stabilizers: The main drug in this category is Lithium (Lithobid).
Anti-nausea medications: These include the drugs granisetron (Kytril), metoclopramide (Reglan), droperidol (Inapsine), and ondansetron (Zofran).
Antibiotics and antiviral medications: This class includes Linezolid (Zyvox), which is an antibiotic and Ritonavir (Norvir). Ritonavir is an antiretroviral used to treat HIV/AIDS.
OTC cough and cold medications containing dextromethorphan: This group includes Delsym, Mucinex DM, and other OTC medications.
Recreational drugs: This group includes LSD, Ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamines.
Herbal supplements: St. John's wort, ginseng, and nutmeg are in this group.

, To prevent serotonin syndrome, always let all physicians that you are working with know all the medications and supplements that you are taking. Supplements such as St John’s wort can interact with prescription medications. Prescription medications can interact with each other. Taking prescribed medication from a physician who doesn’t have all the facts can lead to problems.For example, if your physician doesn’t know that you are taking Lithium because it was prescribed by another physician, and prescribes you an SSRI, this will increase your risk for serotonin syndrome.
Only take the amount of pills prescribed. Do not attempt to self-regulate your dose by taking more than directed by your doctor.

, People who take multiple kinds of medications from the drug classes which often lead to serotonin syndrome are at a high risk for the condition. It commonly occurs when you increase the dosage or start a new medication. If you take multiple medications from these classes, make sure to carefully monitor your symptoms, especially if you have just started a new medication.Serotonin syndrome can be dangerous and lethal, especially in the young, the old, or those with a history of heart disease.

Save the tick’s body for later identification.,
Seek medical attention if the bite wound gets infected.",How to Treat Tick Bites1," Get the tips as close to the bottom of the tick as possible so it does not break when you pull it out., Use even pressure to pull the tick gently out of the skin. Don’t twist, jerk, or yank on the tick or you could break the mouth off inside your skin. Think of smoothly pulling back and arrow on a bow.


Do not resort to force if the tick doesn’t come out easily. Try your best to remove the tick as gently as possible., If the tick’s mouth breaks off in your skin, try to gently remove it with the tweezers. However, if you cannot easily get them out then you should leave the bite alone while your skin heals., Simply remove it with tweezers., This will prevent infection and keep the wound clean and healthy. Cover the bite with a bandage and let it heal naturally, usually after 2-3 days.If you have it, apply a topical antibacterial cream like Neosporin to clean the bite out.

, If you do get sick from the bite, a doctor will likely want to test the tick’s body for diseases. Put the body in a dry jar or ziplock bag and throw it in the freezer for identification., Signs include: tenderness, pus, redness, swelling, and red streaks leading from the bite.

Girls with TS usually grow slower than peers during childhood and adolescence and may also have problems with sexual development. Some do not enter puberty — the ovaries tend to be small and don’t function normally. This means that, without treatment, girls may not develop breasts or begin to menstruate.Talk to your general practitioner if your daughter has been diagnosed with TS and ask about the possibility of hormone therapy. Hormone therapy is one of the primary treatments for girls and women with this condition.
Your doctor will probably refer you to an endocrinologist. This is a specialist in hormonal conditions who can conduct regular tests and checkups as well as advise treatments.;
, Girls who have TS can start to receive growth hormone treatments as soon as it’s clear that they are not growing normally, as early as five or six years old. The treatments usually last until girls are about 15 to 16 years old and the aim is to increase their height as much as possible through the teen years. Often, these treatments can add a couple of inches to girls’ height.Talk to your daughter’s endocrinologist about the best kind of hormone treatment. The most common type is somatropin, which is given by injection several times per week.
Know that somatropin has some side effects, like swelling in the extremities, bleeding, abnormal sensation or tingling feeling, and cold/flu-like symptoms. Girls should stop taking somatropin if there is no growth in the first year, if they are near or reach their final height, or if they are having trouble with side effects.
Ask the endocrinologist about oxandrolone, as well. This is an androgen hormone that some doctors recommend for very short patients and is given along with other growth hormones. Girls won’t receive androgens until they are at least nine years old.

, Another common way to treat TS is by hormone replacement therapy, when doctors give patients doses of estrogen and progesterone — the hormones that cause sexual development in women. Since in TS the ovaries often don’t work properly, adolescent girls may need this therapy to go through puberty and are likely to be infertile as adults. An endocrinologist can help you determine if this sort of treatment is appropriate.Estrogen therapy usually starts around age 11, about the time when most girls start puberty. Doctors will tailor the treatment for each patient but may recommend gradually increasing doses. The estrogen can be given by patches, gels, or tablets and will trigger sexual development.
Progesterone normally comes after estrogen therapy has already begun. In most patients this will trigger and maintain monthly periods.
You should talk with the doctor about when to start this kind of therapy, as high doses of estrogen in the teen years can stunt bone growth. Most women with TS will also have to continue hormone replacement therapy until about age 50, when the body naturally stops producing estrogen.

, TS can affect many body systems and can lead to lots of different complications, from heart problems and high blood pressure to hearing loss and immune disorders. It’s important to see the doctor regularly for checkups to make sure that your daughter is healthy. In fact, we know that getting regular checkups can lead to big improvements in the length and quality of life of women with TS.Schedule checkups as often as the doctor thinks is necessary. These visits will help them trace your daughter’s development but also screen for typical complications.
Checkups can help the doctor look for heart abnormalities and hearing problems, for example. They will also do yearly thyroid blood work to check for conditions like hyperthyroidism.

, Girls with TS will need to have certain areas of health monitored for their whole lives. If complications emerge in one or more of these areas, you may need to get referrals for specialist treatment. Keep in mind that some hospitals have dedicated TS clinics with in-house specialists. Talk to a doctor to see what your options are.About 30% of girls with TS have a structural heart defect. High blood pressure is also common. In these cases, you’ll need to visit a cardiologist regularly for screening and ultrasounds.
Hearing loss is also common for girls and women with TS, as are middle ear infections, so you may need to find an ears, nose, and throat specialist.
About 1/3 girls with TS also have malformed kidneys, which can increase blood pressure and the risk of urinary tract infections. Keep this in mind and consider seeing a specialist in the kidneys (a nephrologist).
Apart from these doctors, girls and women with TS may need special attention from other specialists like gynecologists, geneticists, and pediatric and adult endocrinologists. Some may also benefit from developmental therapy, as TS can sometimes create learning disabilities and difficulty functioning in social situations.

, Women with TS need lifelong medical treatment. If you have a daughter with this condition, it’s important to her health that you prepare her to take care of herself as an adult and to transition from a pediatrician to her own medical team. Her adult doctor will be able to coordinate care with whatever specialists she needs.Start talking to your daughter early on about her treatment and care, so that she learns about her condition, needs, and overall health. In time, she can take on more and more responsibilities.
Encourage her to have healthy habits. This can include getting regular checkups but also exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, joining a support group for TS, and being social.

, Due to the problems it causes with sexual development, many adult women with TS are infertile — they are unable to have children. While some may be able to conceive naturally, about 2 – 5%, their ovaries can still fail early on in adulthood. Others who want to have children will have to consider artificial means.Sit down and talk to a doctor if you or a close loved one has TS. Discussing sexual health is important. Since a minority of women with TS can become pregnant, those who are sexually active should have access to sexual health services and contraceptive advice and practice safe sex.
A doctor can also help with the timing of pregnancies. This may be key if natural conception is possible, but the doctor is concerned about the health of the patient’s ovaries.

, Some women with TS who are infertile but still want children can become pregnant with assisted conception treatments, like egg donation and in vitro fertilization (IVF). In this procedure, an egg from a donor is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the patient’s womb to grow.Women with TS who want to try IVF will have to take a special kind of hormone therapy to prepare their uterus for pregnancy.
Know that IVF is not cheap. The price of just one cycle in the US (and it may take a number of cycles) can be over $10,000. Even then, pregnancy is not guaranteed.

, Pregnancy for women with TS can be high-risk and needs to be watched carefully. If a woman with TS is lucky enough to become pregnant, she’ll also need to get regular checkups while she carries the baby to term. This is because of the heart and vascular complications that TS can cause. Pregnancy will put an extra strain on the heart and on the blood vessels, so, for the health of the mother and baby, it’s very important to be vigilant.Patients should get an exam if they are thinking about trying to have a child — this includes a general examination but also a cardiovascular assessment to check blood pressure and heart health. Doctors may want to perform other tests on the liver and endocrine system, as well.
Doctors will strongly discourage pregnancy if a patient has certain conditions, especially if she has problems with the heart’s aorta or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
During pregnancy, patients will need to get regular follow-up care. This includes echocardiograms at the end of the first and second trimester and then each month during the third trimester. She may need to go on blood pressure medication like beta blockers and be monitored by ultrasound after delivery, as the cardiovascular risk continues for a number of days.

See a doctor immediately if you have a rash, joint pain, headache, or fever.,
Know the symptoms of Lyme Disease.,
Know the symptoms of Southern Tick Associated Rash Illness (STARI).,
Know the symptoms of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.,
Know the symptoms of Ehrlichiosis.,
Know the symptoms of Tularemia.",How to Treat Tick Bites2," These are all signs of common tick-borne illnesses. Because these diseases can spread quickly it is best to see a doctor immediately if symptoms arise.


If you’ve save it, bring the body of the tick with you for identification.

, Lyme disease is the most common disease transmitted from ticks to humans. Lyme disease can lead to serious muscle, joint and brain impairment if not treated. Symptoms typically begin within 3-30 days of the bite, and include:


Red “bulls-eye” rash around the location of the bite.
Fever, chills.
Joint pain.
Swollen lymph nodes., STARI occurs only in the east coast of America, from the southeastern edge of Nebraska all the way to Maine and Florida.It is transmitted by the lone star tick. Symptoms include:


Red rash (2-4 centimeters wide) developing within a week of the tick bite.
Fatigue
Headache
Muscle pains.

, Transmitted by multiple species of tick, this bacterial disease can be fatal if untreated. If you notice any of the following symptoms, get treatment immediately – treatment is most effective if started within 5 days of the infection.Sudden fever and headache.
Rash (though many patients never get a rash)
Nausea and vomiting.
Abdominal pain.
Red eyes.
Muscle or joint pain., This disease has spread across the United States and South America through multiple species of ticks. When caught early, treatment is usually a simple course of antibiotics. However, left unchecked it can cause serious medical issues. Symptoms include:


Fever and chills.
Headache.
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
Confusion or lack of mental clarity.
Red eyes.
Rash (60% of children, under 30% of adults)., This disease kills large numbers of rodents and rabbits each year, but is usually treated quickly with antibiotics for humans. Symptoms include:


Red, blister-like ulcer at the bite site.
Irritated and inflamed eyes.
Sore throat, tonsillitis
Coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing (severe cases).

Know common tick-infested areas.,
Wear long clothing while hiking.,
Use insect repellent with 20-30% DEET on exposed skin.,
Coat clothes, tents and equipment in 5% permethrin.,
Never apply permethrin directly to your skin.

,
Bath or shower shortly after returning indoors.,
Use a mirror or a friend to check your entire body for ticks.,
Tumble dry your clothes on high-heat to kill ticks.",How to Treat Tick Bites3," Ticks like tall grasses, wooded areas, and shrubs. Walk in the center of hiking trails to avoid brushing up against tick infested areas.

, Pants and long sleeves can protect your from ever having to deal with tick bites. Tuck your pants into your socks or boots to prevent them from crawling up under your clothes.

, This is the most effect barrier against tick bites. Avoiding the noise, eyes, and mouth, spray your skin with DEET every 2-3 hours to avoid bites.


If you can’t use DEET, some naturalists swear by 2-3 drops of strong smelling Rose Geranium oil as a natural repellent., This chemical is too toxic to put directly on the skin, but it creates a barrier against ticks that lasts through up to 5-6 washings. Clothes that are advertised as “tick-repellent” are coated in permethrin.,, Many ticks will be on your body for several hours before biting. Wash off with soap and water to remove them and easily see if any have already bitten you.

, Ticks can get into clothing and bite you anywhere, so be sure to check under the arms, behind the ears and knees, and in any hair.Perform this check as soon after leaving the woods as possible.

, Any ticks trapped in your clothing will die in the drier. Using high heat, dry your clothes for at least an hour to get rid of any remaining ticks."
"
Use topical creams.,
Start light therapy.,
Begin systemic therapy.,
Discuss the option of a biologic therapy.",How to Treat Severe Plaque Psoriasis1," The first type of medical treatment that doctors often prescribe for plaque psoriasis is a medicated cream. These are applied directly to areas of inflammation. These creams often contain steroids, which help to minimize skin cell growth and reduce inflammation.Reducing skin growth in areas with plaque psoriasis is important for treatment because the scaling of the skin is due to the overgrowth of cells in that area.
Reducing inflammation will minimize the redness and will reduce itching and pain in the area as well.
If you experience scalp psoriasis, ask your doctor about a medicated steroid solution. These are typically thinner and more watery than lotions and creams, and are thus more easily absorbed by the scalp.;
, Light therapy can help to treat severe plaque psoriasis by exposing the skin to ultraviolet light on a regular basis. In some cases, your doctor will even prescribe a medication, psoralen, which, when taken in combination with light therapy, increases its effectiveness. The use of ultraviolet light slows the growth of plaque psoriasis skin cells, minimizing scaling and redness.Light therapy is done in a doctor's office or with a UVB light unit at home.
The key to light therapy is doing it consistently. Whether you do it at home or in a doctor's office, it needs to be done daily for maximum effect.
Using tanning beds does not provide the same benefit to plaque psoriasis. Instead of the therapeutic use of UVB light, tanning beds mostly emit UVA light. Additionally, tanning beds increase the likelihood of getting skin cancer.

, Systemic therapy can be given orally, by injection, or by infusion, depending on what specific medication your doctor prescribes. In many cases, systemic therapy won't be used unless other treatments don't minimize the plaque psoriasis. However, if you have severe plaque psoriasis, your dermatologist will likely recommend this treatment in addition to other treatments.


Some medications that may be prescribed include: Methotrexate, Retinoids, Cyclosporine, and Biologic response modifiers., Your dermatologist may prescribe a traditional systemic therapy or a biologic therapy. Unlike traditional systemic therapies, which treat the entire immune system, biologic therapies target specific areas of the immune system. In the case of treatment for plaque psoriasis, biologic treatments block cells and proteins that are central to the development of psoriasis.Biologic drugs are either injected or administered intravenously.
You cannot take biologic drugs if you have an active infection or if your immune system is severely compromised.

Keep your skin moisturized.,
Take nourishing baths.,
Quit smoking.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Treat Severe Plaque Psoriasis2," Keeping areas of plaque psoriasis moisturized will help to minimize the dry, scaly skin of the condition and will reduce itchiness. Find a moisturizer that is very thick or use an ointment that can seal in moisture, such as petroleum jelly.Make sure that all products you use are fragrance free. It is a good idea to look for products that are labeled for ""sensitive skin,"" as they are likely to have little or no fragrances or added chemicals.
You can even use olive oil or coconut oil like a lotion on your plaque psoriasis. The oil will help moisturize the skin by keeping existing moisture trapped in the skin.
If you are having a hard time picking a moisturizer, talk to your doctor about products that will work well for your condition and that will be compatible with your medical treatment.

, While baths without additives can actually dry out your skin if you take them too often, adding nourishing items to the bath can help to moisturize the skin. Items you can add to your bath to help treat your plaque psoriasis include fine ground oatmeal, oil (such as olive or coconut oil), or salt.Epsom salts are a great addition to these nourishing baths because they add magnesium and sulfate to the skin.
Try adding apple cider vinegar to your bath. Soaking in a nourishing bath that has apple cider vinegar added to it will help minimize redness and itchiness.
Right after your bath dry yourself off lightly with a towel but don't rub. Then immediately put on your thick lotion or ointment to seal in the moisture from the bath., Smoking can cause symptom flare ups and it generally hurts your health, which impacts your body's ability to fight off the plaque psoriasis.This is an especially important part of treatment if you are coping with a particularly severe case of plaque psoriasis.

, In addition to using home remedies to ease your symptoms, you can adjust your lifestyle to minimize symptoms and to minimize the risk of flareups. Drinking too much alcohol can cause your plaque psoriasis symptoms to flare., There are a variety of dietary changes that you can make that will help your plaque psoriasis. In general, try to cut out fatty and sugary foods and eat more healthy foods, such as vegetables and foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.Foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids include fish, flaxseeds, olive oil, and pumpkin seeds. These will help to reduce inflammation.
Avoid eating fatty red meats, dairy products, processed foods, refined sugars, and nightshade vegetables. Nightshade vegetables include potatoes, tomatoes and peppers.
Try adding dietary supplements to your diet. Natural dietary supplements, such as fish oil, vitamin D, and milk thistle, can help ease your symptoms."

Apply the tincture of iodine.,
Rub iodine onto the affected areas 3 times per day.,
Launder the towel used to dry the affected areas.",How to Treat Ringworm With Iodine," Iodine is available at most drug stores in the first aid section. Buy an iodine solution with 2% iodine. Anything stronger than 2% iodine can be harmful to your skin.
, Use antibacterial soap and warm water to cleanse the ringworm site. Pat the area dry with a hand towel or a paper towel. Place the paper towel into a bag and seal the bag shut, or set the hand towel aside for laundering.

, Iodine comes in a small glass or plastic bottle. Pour a small amount of iodine onto a cotton ball or dip a cotton swab into the bottle. Use gentle strokes to apply the iodine to the ringworm area.

, Applying iodine more than 3 times a day can increase your risk of iodine poisoning, which results in symptoms like vomiting, increased thirst and difficult urination. It can take up to 4 weeks for the fungus to be destroyed and the visible signs of ringworm to disappear.

, Wash personal items, such as towels, sheets and clothes, in hot water each day. Separate these items from other household laundry to keep ringworm from spreading to others in the household.

Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese are also good sources., You should add foods with calcium to your diet whenever possible. This is especially important if a calcium deficiency is part of the rickets diagnosis. Yogurt, milk, and cheese are all good sources of calcium. You can also add calcium to your diet with tofu, kale, or cabbage., A deficiency in vitamin D can be one of the root causes of rickets. Sunlight boosts the body’s vitamin D levels and can be an important part of a rickets treatment plan. If you have light skin, aim for 3 to 15 minutes of midday sun each day. If you have dark skin, try to get 15 to 30 minutes of midday sun exposure daily., Sometimes a doctor will ask you or your child to wear corrective braces as part of the treatment for rickets. If the doctor asks you or your child to wear corrective devices, make sure you follow the doctor’s directions precisely. Corrective braces can help prevent and treat deformities caused by rickets., Gentle, regular exercise can help keep joints mobile and build muscle. Exercise can also help someone with rickets stay mobile. Ask your doctor what types of gentle exercise are right for you or your child., You should not attempt to diagnose or treat rickets on your own. You will need the care and advice of a medical professional to help you determine the proper treatment for rickets., The doctor will do a physical examination as part of their effort to determine if you or your child has rickets. As part of the physical exam, they will be evaluating you or your child for tenderness or pain in your bones., Doctors use blood tests to determine whether or not a person has rickets. A doctor will usually test for low levels of calcium and phosphorus. They will also test for high levels of alkaline phosphatase. In some instances, doctors will perform genetic tests to see if the rickets is an inherited disorder., In addition to blood tests, doctors will also perform x-rays on you or your child’s bones. They will examine the x-rays for signs of calcium loss or for changes in the shape of a bone. Ask the doctor to perform x-rays in addition to blood tests if you think you or your child has rickets., Before you attempt to treat rickets, you should obtain a detailed treatment plan from your doctor. This will include the types and amounts of supplements you or your child should take, foods you or your child should be eating, and possibly the use of corrective braces., It is important that you monitor the disease through regular checkups, x-rays, and blood tests. Talk to your doctor about how often you or your child should be reevaluated., Sometimes surgery is needed to correct bone damage caused by rickets. Surgery can help correct bone deformities and prevent future disfiguration. Ask the doctor if surgery will be part of the recovery plan.The type of surgery you or your child might need depends on you or your child’s medical history and particular case.

Weakness
Shakiness
Drowsiness
Sweating
Lightheadedness
Anxiety
Confusion
Decreased awareness;
, Call a doctor if you have hypoglycemia but do not have diabetes or you have diabetes but your blood sugar levels are not returning to normal after ingesting something sweet. Call an ambulance if you or someone you are with has the following symptoms:Losing consciousness
Seeming drunk because they slur their words and lose their coordination
Having seizures
Having blurred vision

, If you think you have reactive hypoglycemia you should make an appointment to discuss your symptoms and have a blood test. Your doctor will likely confirm the diagnosis by:Measuring your blood sugar levels when you are having symptoms. If you have reactive hypoglycemia, your blood sugar should be low when you are experiencing symptoms.
Giving you something to eat or drink when you are having symptoms, then measuring your blood sugar again. If your blood sugar returns to normal and your symptoms stop, this means that you have reactive hypoglycemia.

, Eating smaller amounts more often will help you maintain steady blood sugar levels. People with reactive hypoglycemia should eat small amounts every three hours. This may mean that you need to divide up your larger meals into six or more smaller ones.Bring convenient, healthy snacks with you wherever you go. That way, if you feel your blood sugar drop, you can quickly have a nutritious snack to bring it back up to normal.
Easy snacks include fresh fruits and vegetables like bananas, apples, carrots, green peppers, or cucumbers. Other possibilities include small sandwiches or peanut butter on whole-grain crackers.

, Consult your doctor and/or a nutritionist to create a meal plan that works with your condition and your lifestyle. In general, protein and complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and will provide energy to your body more steadily, relative to simple carbohydrates and sugars. The latter are more likely to make your blood sugar increase sharply and then crash.Excellent sources of protein include lean meats like fish and poultry, low-fat dairy products, eggs, tofu and beans.
Complex carbohydrates can be found in whole grain breads, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and oatmeal.
Choose healthy sources of fat which are also digested slowly and can help balance your blood sugar. These include: nuts, seeds, avocado, olives and olive oil.Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and sugars. These are found in cookies, cakes, and pastries that are made of white flour and processed sugars. Avoid eating sugary foods on an empty stomach.
Spread out your carbohydrate intake evenly over the day. This will help you avoid having your body produce a lot of insulin, which might later, cause your blood sugar to crash., Caffeine causes your body to produce adrenaline and it can cause you to have similar symptoms to hypoglycemia. Foods and drinks to avoid include:Coffee
Green and black teas
Caffeinated sodas
Chocolate

, If you are drinking alcohol, don’t do so on an empty stomach and avoid using sugary drinks as mixers. This can cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash.The Mayo Clinic recommends limiting your drinks to one per day for women and one to two per day for men.A drink is 12-oz of beer, 5-oz of wine, or 1.5-oz of spirits.

, Being physically active increases the amount of sugar your body uses and reduces the likelihood that you will produce too much insulin. Consult with your doctor or a physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that is right for you.The Mayo Clinic recommends that adults do 75–150 minutes of exercise per week. This can be whatever you enjoy most, such as biking, walking, running, or playing sports., Be aware that some people experience drastically reduced awareness and reaction times when they are hypoglycemic. To avoid problems, you can carry snacks with you and test your blood sugar before you do important or potentially dangerous activities like:Driving
Operating heavy machinery
Working with chemicals
Taking important exams at school

, If you are vulnerable to severe hypoglycemic states or your performance at work or school is suffering, you may want to consider telling those around you. This will enable them to support you and to recognize what is happening if you experience a hypoglycemic reaction in their presence. You can:Wear a medical identification bracelet in case you lose consciousness.
Discuss it with your family and friends so they can support and help you.
Tell your coworkers what you do to manage your condition.
Talk to your nurse and teachers at school.
Join a support group if your condition makes it difficult to manage your daily responsibilities.

Your doctor can develop a treatment plan and heal any underlying or related conditions you may develop from ringworm, including a skin infection.Your regular doctor or a dermatologist can diagnose and develop a treatment plan for ringworm.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of ringworm and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as if you’ve been exposed to any people or animals with ringworm.You may find it difficult to heal ringworm at home if you have a weakened immune system or diabetes and may need to see a doctor., Your doctor may likely be able to diagnose ringworm simply by looking at it. She may order additional tests to help confirm a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan.If your case isn’t clear cut, your doctor may take some skin scraping to examine under a microscope. This can help her identify the fungus and more definitively diagnose ringworm., Depending on the severity of your case, your doctor may prescribe an anti-fungal cream. More powerful than over the counter creams or lotions, prescription anti-fungal creams may help alleviate your ringworm more effectively.Make sure to follow your doctor’s instructions when using a prescription anti-fungal cream.

, Many doctors prefer to prescribe oral medications for ringworm. Make sure you tell your doctor about any medical problems you have, any allergies, any medications you take, and if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Take these pills as directed by your doctor to most effectively treat your ringworm.The most common anti-fungal oral medications are terbinafine, itraconazole, griseofulvin, and fluconazole.Oral anti-fungal medications are usually taken for 8-10 weeks and are available at most pharmacies.Make sure to follow the indications on the prescription for maximum efficacy.
You may experience some side effects from these medications including: diarrhea, nausea, headache, and indigestion.Tell your doctor if you have any side effects that are more than mild.
If you have a ringworm on your scalp, your doctor may suggest pairing an oral anti-fungal with anti-fungal shampoo.If you have ringworm on your nails, your doctor may suggest pairing an oral anti-fungal with an anti-fungal nail paint.Your doctor may take blood tests before, during, or after your treatment course.

Make an appointment with a speech and language therapist.One of the mainstays of treating progressive aphasia is to work with a speech and language therapist to address the challenges that you are having with language and with communication.,
Learn alternate modes of communication.Some people struggle more with language comprehension (understanding written and/or spoken words), while others find expressive language (speaking, articulating, and finding appropriate word choices) to be the primary challenge.,
Know that progressive aphasia can be managed, but not cured.When you go to see a speech and language therapist, there is nothing she can do to reverse or otherwise slow the progression of your condition.,
Connect with others who also have progressive aphasia.The challenges of those who suffer from progressive aphasia are unique, so to connect with others who are in the same boat can be extremely helpful.,
Carry information about your illness with you.Because progressive aphasia affects your language and communication abilities, these very communication challenges can make it difficult to explain your illness to others.,
Ask for modified duties at the workplace.,
Ask your doctor to perform regular clinical exams.It is important to receive regular clinical exams from your doctor both to assess how your disease is progressing (and how you are coping), as well as to ensure that nothing else is going on.,
Consider asking for a head CT or MRI.In addition to ruling out other degenerative brain diseases, it is also key to differentiate progressive aphasia from other causes of aphasia (communication troubles), such as aphasia resulting from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury.,
Learn the causes of progressive aphasia.,
Know the expected course of progressive aphasia.As you seek treatment for your progressive aphasia, it is important to know what to expect.",How to Treat Progressive Aphasia," These challenges vary widely from individual to individual, because they are directly related to the specific areas of your brain that are affected by the condition.;
, Most people have a blend to the two challenges (called ""expressive"" and ""receptive"" language skills), with one being more of a problematic than the other (however, which one is more burdensome could change as the condition progresses).


Depending upon the type of language challenge you are faced with, some people find it helpful to learn alternate modes of communication such as gesturing and/or pointing.
The mainstay of treatment is to focus on the strengths you have (i.e. the skills you have preserved) when it comes to language and communication, and to adapt your form of communication to rely as much as possible on your strengths, while avoiding your weaknesses. This is because your weaknesses will likely only continue to deteriorate with time, given that they signify the area with brain damage.Unfortunately, sign language does not work as an alternative mode of communication for people with progressive aphasia, as it relies on the same areas of the brain that are already damaged due to the disease.Using apps on an iPhone or an iPad that can speak for a person may be of help.
Having family members and friends communicate simply and clearly can also aid with comprehension.

, All she can do is help you to develop strategies to manage your condition most effectively, and to preserve your language and communication abilities for as long as possible by working with you on adaptive techniques.


It is important to know that the condition cannot be cured, so as not to have unrealistically high expectations of the therapist you are working with.

, Not only does it aid in not feeling alone, but you may also pick up valuable tips and strategies by seeing how others have coped with their illness.


Check to see if there is an Aphasia Community Group in your area.

, To avoid the confusion of others not understanding your difficulties, some people find it helpful to carry printed information about their illness and to bring it with them to public or social situations.


You may wish to carry an ID card with you, if introducing yourself clearly and coherently is a problem.
You may also wish to carry a small amount of printed information detailing your condition and explaining how it is best for people to interact with you, as this can help to smooth your ability to fit in socially.

, Because progressive aphasia is a condition that is usually mild at the start, and progresses at a slow rate, many people can continue working for several years even after being diagnosed with the condition. You may wish to let your boss know that you have the condition, and/or to ask for modified duties should you find that it is interfering with your ability to effectively communicate (either in written or spoken language) in your current job.


You may also wish to look into whether you have any employee insurance or other health care coverage that can help with medical appointments, and/or with paid time off work.

, In progressive aphasia, you will have only language and communication deficits on exam. You will have no other mental challenges, such as problems with your memory, with your physical ability to perform day-to-day tasks, or with any of your other thinking processes.


Your doctor can run through a series of cognitive tests with you to rule out other common conditions, such as Alzheimer's dementia.

, Your doctor will be able to rule out other conditions such as a stroke or a traumatic brain injury by performing a neurological exam, as well as by offering you a head CT or MRI which can give further insight into any anatomical or structural problems.


Progressive aphasia will show shrinkage of certain brain tissues (related to the language functions) on CT scan.
However, the appearance of progressive aphasia can be differentiated on imaging from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury.

, Progressive aphasia occurs when brain cells in the areas related to language malfunction and die. It is usually caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). (It is important to note that Alzheimer’s disease is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia.)FTLD occurs when parts of the brain atrophy or shrink,and AD is caused by microscopic abnormalities in the brain.When FTLD and AD occur in the areas of brain that control speech and language, the person develops progressive aphasia.Progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD in 60–70% of cases and AD in 30–40%. Whether progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD or AD can only be determined by autopsy.In most cases, progressive aphasia is not genetic.Remember that progressive aphasia is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia — while language skills degenerate, the person should be completely functional otherwise. A person with progressive aphasia usually can continue taking care of himself and pursue hobbies and interests.A person with Alzheimer's dementia will experience a progressive loss of all cognitive function, not just speech.Progressive aphasia is also not caused by brain trauma, stroke, tumor, or infection., This condition is one that is not curable, and can only be managed as best as possible as it continues to progress gradually with time. (This is another feature that differentiates it from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, as both of these can show improvements with time and a slow regaining of function, rather than a continual deterioration.)


When you understand that the goal is to effectively manage the condition, rather than to cure it, it can help you to go into your doctor's and therapist's appointments with realistic expectations in terms of what they can do for you.

Assess your knee pain.,
Look for swelling around the patellar tendon.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.",How to Treat Patellar Tendinitis1," Tell-tale signs of patellar tendinitis include tenderness in front of the patella at the inferior (lower) portion of the kneecap or the tendon itself when the leg is extended but not when it is fully bent (Basset’s sign), or pain in the area when rising from a deeply seated position (Movie Theatre sign). It will likely be a persistent burning or warmth type of pain.Increased pain with use is a telltale sign of tendinitis.;
, If you have this condition, you may experience swelling in your knee. It might also be tender or sensitive to the touch.Many cases of patellar tendinitis do not have swelling, so this symptom may not be present in your case., While not a specialist on the knee, your primary care provider knows normal anatomy and can diagnose typical ailments, as well as rule out more serious issues, and make referrals to a specialist when necessary. Patellar tendinitis is most often diagnosed with a physical exam. In some cases, an MRI may be necessary to obtain accurate images of the knee to fully diagnose the condition.

"
"
Rest the injured patellar tendon.,
Try icing your knee.,
Buy a patellar tendon strap.,
Immobilize your leg.",How to Treat Patellar Tendinitis2," Take a break from any activities that require you to run, jump or squat. Don’t ignore your nagging pain and try to exercise through it. It will not go away. In fact, it will only get worse the more you exercise. Continuing to exercise may lead to further injury.If you experience a lot of pain, you should stop exercising and rest your leg from activities that aggravate the condition.

, If you feel pain or swelling, you ice your knee. Create an ice pack by adding ice into a plastic bag and placing the bag inside a towel. Apply the ice to relieve pain and possible swelling that you might be experiencing. Apply ice for 10 minutes after exercise for pain relief, but note that ice will not help the underlying condition.

, This strap is a band that goes around your leg just under the patella. The strap puts pressure on the tendon, thereby redistributing the load throughout the tendon and reducing pain.This is a good support device to use during rehabilitation.
A patellar tendon strap can be purchased at most drug and medical supply stores.
Even if you use a strap, you still need to give your tendon time to heal.

, If you experience pain when resting your leg, you probably need a brace to immobilize your leg. Once pain subsides while you’re resting, you can gradually increase your activity. Only do as much as your leg will allow without the pain returning.If you are experiencing enough pain that you need to immobilize your leg, you definitely need to see your doctor. You will likely need to rest your leg until you are fully recovered.

"
"
Work with a physical therapist.,
Try eccentric squats.,
Talk to your doctor about iontophoresis.",How to Treat Patellar Tendinitis3," Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist. This specialist will recommend exercises for stretching and strengthening your muscles, including the patella tendon.


Your physical therapist may focus on stretching your hamstrings. Overly tight hamstrings is thought to be a major cause of patellar tendinitis.
These include exercises such as isometric quad contractions, single leg extensions, eccentric squats, lunges or step backs., Your doctor may recommend certain exercises for rehabilitating your leg. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead, try eccentric squats. These help strengthen the hamstring, glute and quad muscles.Stand on a 25-degree slant board with your feet parallel, hip-width apart and your heels on the elevated side. You can improvise a slant board by placing a piece of wood on the curb, but you can also buy one online.
Keep your lower back straight. Squat slowly until you are parallel to the ground by sitting back instead of dipping down. Never bounce or move with momentum.,, Take three seconds for the way down, and take two or three seconds for getting up again.
Do three sets of up to 15 repetitions.
If the exercises are effective, you should feel less pain and more able to function in a shorter amount of time.Other than skin irritation, no other side effects are known. However, this is a newer procedure so long-term effects are not yet known., Iontophoresis is the local delivery of drugs (pain medicine, anti-inflammatories) using an electrical current. Some studies have shown that iontophoresis with corticosteroid improved the recovery time when compared to a placebo."
"
Consider surgery.,
Try patellar platelet-rich plasma injections.,
Ask your doctor about extra-corporeal shock wave therapy.",How to Treat Patellar Tendinitis4," If chronic patellar tendinitis is suspected, surgery maybe an option to help clean up debris in the tendon.Depending on the severity of your injury, your doctor will repair tears found in your tendon.


The surgeon may need to reattach the tendon by first drilling holes in the patella. Then a suture is placed through the tendon and tied to the top of the patella. A newer surgical procedure involves reattaching the tendon using an anchor. Most patients are able to go home the same day of surgery.You will need to attend physical therapy as directed after surgery.

, Platelet-rich plasma injections are thought to help otherwise weak tendon tissue to regenerate and repair quicker.,To administer an injection, a specialist will first take a blood sample from you. Then, the sample is put in a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from the rest of the blood. The plasma is then injected into the tendon. The entire process takes about 20 minutes.These injections are not covered by insurance as they have not yet been proven to be any better than placebo.

, This alternative therapy option relies on sound waves to relieve tendon pain.Studies show that extra-corporeal shock wave therapy can help with recovery and with pain by stimulating cells to repair the tendon.This therapy is usually used when all other options are exhausted. It is not considered the first or best option because it is used with more chronic pain.<

Seek treatment immediately.,
Receive breathing assistance.,
Get fluids intravenously.,
Take medications to reduce swelling.,
Consume activated charcoal.,
Educate yourself about different types of exposure.,
Cover your mouth and get fresh air.,
Destroy items or clothing that are contaminated.,
Wash yourself.",How to Treat Ricin Poisoning," Once you have been poisoned with ricin, you’ll need to seek treatment immediately. The quicker you get treatment, the better your chances of living. If untreated, ricin may begin to shut down your respiratory and other important systems. In the US, call (800) 222-1222 to speak with Poison Control immediately.

Symptoms can begin to appear in as little as 4 hours after poisoning.
You could die in as little as 36 to 72 hours after being poisoned.
The method of poisoning impacts how quickly your body will be harmed.;
, One of the most severe symptoms of ricin inhalation is respiratory distress. As a result, if you are a victim of ricin poisoning, you may wind up needing help breathing. A doctor can provide treatment to keep you breathing while you are stabilized.

You may need to be hooked up to a machine to help you breathe.
You may need a tube inserted through your airway., Fluid therapy is extremely important when it comes to treating ricin poisoning. This is because you will likely be unable to take in the liquids your body needs to process the toxin. As a result, fluid therapy is one of the first things medical professionals will provide when you are being treated for ricin poisoning.

Fluid retention by cells may also increase the need for intravenous fluid therapy.
You may be treated with isotonic fluids (saline solution) by a doctor or other medical professional. Do not try to administer an IV to yourself.
You might also need an intravenous packed red blood cell infusion.
A doctor might provide dopamine or norepinephrine intravenously., Your body may react to ricin poisoning by swelling. Swelling could impact your respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and other important systems or organs. As a result, you may be prescribed medication to reduce swelling.

Ricin may cause edema, which is when tissue absorbs excess water. Edema may occur in the lungs, arms, legs, or other parts of the body.
Follow the directions of your doctor, as the medication they prescribe will depend on your specific circumstances., If you have ingested ricin in the last few hours, you may benefit from ingesting activated charcoal. The charcoal will help slow your body’s ability to absorb the ricin, thus reducing the impact of the poison.

Activated charcoal may be taken by mouth or given through a feeding tube.
The quicker you take activated charcoal, the better it will work., There are several different ways you can be poisoned with ricin. It is important to know how you were exposed, as treatment is geared towards different types of exposure.

In the case that you ingest ricin, treatment may begin with your gastrointestinal tract.
In the case that you inhale ricin, treatment will begin with your respiratory tract.
In the case that you are injected with ricin, treatment may begin with intravenous fluid therapy., If you suspect you’re in an environment contaminated with ricin, you should cover your mouth immediately and leave the area of contamination. If possible, wet down a towel or other cloth and cover your mouth. Ultimately, the less ricin you inhale, the higher your chances of recovering.

While simply covering your mouth won’t completely prevent you from inhaling ricin, it may limit the amount you do inhale.
Use your hand if you don’t have anything else.
Move as far away from the initial site of contamination as you can., Once you’ve left an area of contamination, you need to discard and destroy any items or clothing that were with you when you were exposed. This is important, as they could contain traces of ricin.

Use rubber gloves to handle any potentially contaminated objects.
Any items that contact contaminated objects should also be discarded, including gloves.
Make sure to seal the initial bag with another one.
Contact your county, city, or municipal authority’s toxic waste disposal authorities. If you don’t have the number, you may want to call the police or fire department. However, make sure to inform the dispatcher that you are dealing with a suspected ricin exposure., After you’ve removed and destroyed all items you wore when you were contaminated, you should wash yourself carefully. By washing yourself, you’ll reduce the ability of the toxin to become airborne. This will limit further exposure.

Make sure to wash yourself as quickly as you can.
Rinse your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes, if your eyes burn or your vision is blurred.
Wash your eyeglasses and any important pieces of jewelry. Make sure to discard contact lenses."

Adopt a care plan.,
Consider growth hormones.,
Treat associated conditions.,
Look into sex hormone treatment.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Treat Prader Willi Syndrome1," After your doctor has diagnosed your child with Prader-Willi Syndrome, they will help you come up with a care plan that is specific to your child and their specific PWS symptoms. This plan will change as your child grows up and their needs and symptoms change.You will also find a point person who will be your contact. This person will help you with the various needs your child will have related to their condition. Generally, this starts out as a medical professional and then becomes a social worker as the child gets older.
Part of your care plan will be coming up with a diet and exercise plan specifically made for your child.;
, One treatment for children with Prader-Willi Syndrome is human growth hormone treatment. This helps your child’s growth and physical development. It also helps with increasing metabolic function. HGH can also help with muscle tone and ability, stamina, and help decrease obesity and weight gain.No studies have been done to determine the long-term effects of HGH, so doctors don't know how HGH will affect adults with PWS.Your child will need to see an endocrinologist to decide if HGH is the proper treatment for them.

, PWS may lead to problems with different body parts, such as the eyes, spine, or teeth. Children may also suffer from sleeping problems. Working with your care team can help you determine what associated conditions need to be treated.For example, your child may need to see a pediatric ophthalmologist to treat eye problems. Orthopedists can treat spine curvature. Physical therapy may be needed if the child is experiencing severe muscle weakness.
The pediatrician or a sleep specialist can help treat sleep disorders.

, Some children with PWS can undergo sex hormone replacement therapy to help with the reduced development of sexual organs and delayed puberty due to low levels of sex hormones. Sex hormone therapy generally starts around the age of puberty and is overseen by an endocrinologist.Females get estrogen and progesterone through an oral contraceptive. This also helps in the prevention of osteoporosis.
Males get testosterone, but not all endocrinologists support this therapy. Though it can help with sexual development, it may make behavior problems worse., Your child may need to undergo surgery to correct their underdeveloped sex organs. If your child is male and has underdeveloped testicles or penis, your doctor will probably recommend that he undergo surgery. This surgery can correct undescended testicles, which can cause testicular cancer if left untreated.Females can have surgery to correct an underdeveloped clitoris.Untreated underdeveloped sex organs may also cause severe self-esteem or body issues.

Get help with intellectual development.,
Determine if your child needs mental health care.,
Establish structure.,
Give the child plenty of time to finish tasks.,
Manage tantrums.,
Prepare your child for transitioning to adulthood.",How to Treat Prader Willi Syndrome2," Your child may need therapy or special needs programs for learning disabilities or delays in intellectual development. This may include speech therapy to help with language and pronunciation skills, occupational therapy to help with everyday tasks, or developmental therapy to help with social behaviors.Your child may need a special education program at school — these special educational programs are required by law. Teachers should be made aware of your child’s condition.

, Some children with Prader-Willi Syndrome need to be under the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist in addition to doctors. Some children suffer from OCD behaviors, such as skin picking, or have severe behavior disorders.Your child may be able to take medications, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, to help with behavior problems and OCD symptoms.
Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) may be an effective treatment for skin picking.

, Children with PWS do well when they have structure and routines in their daily lives. Each day should follow a routine. Meal routines should be strictly enforced. Times should be put into place for exercise, play, homework, hygiene tasks, and family time.If the routine is going to change, let the child know ahead of time to help them come to terms with the change.

, Due to physical mobility problems and developmental delays, your child may take longer to complete tasks than other children. Let them complete tasks at their own pace without pressuring them to go faster than they are able.If a task needs to be completed within a specific time frame, such as getting dressed, you should ensure they have plenty of time to complete the task.

, If your child has tantrums, you should learn how to manage them. You should eventually learn how to identify the signs that your child is about to have a tantrum so you can avoid it before it starts. Try to distract the child from the oncoming tantrum by doing something completely different than what you are doing at the moment. Start talking about something they like or doing something different.Suggest that your child go to another room to play, listen to music, or do breathing exercises.
Stay calm. Getting upset may feed your child’s tantrum. If you are unable to help your child, get a partner or other person to handle the child.
Talk to your care team about restraint techniques if your child’s tantrums cause self-harm or harm to others.
Refrain from rewarding tantrums by giving the child what they want. Never give food when the child throws a tantrum. You don’t want the child to think tantrums are a way to get a treat.

, Most people with PWS cannot live on their own and need supervised care. People often live with their parents or live in group homes or residential facilities that help manage their condition, offer work and recreational activities, and help with health conditions.Residential care helps adults with PWS manage compulsive overeating and avoid severe obesity."
"
Buy special nipples or feeding tubes.,
Feed your child higher calorie formula.,
Enforce portion control.,
Adopt an eating schedule.,
Take charge of your child’s food.,
Make healthy food choices.,
Lock away all food.,
Encourage exercise and physical activity.,
Find a support group.",How to Treat Prader Willi Syndrome3," Trouble sucking is one of the common symptoms of PWS in newborns and infants. To help with this, you can buy special nipples or feeding tubes to use with your baby to help them until they are able to suck properly. This ensures your baby gets the amount of nutrition needed to properly grow and not starve.You should be able to find the nipples at a pharmacy or medical supply store. Ask your doctor the best place in your area to buy them.
If your child needs a feeding tube, these may need to be used with medical supervision. One type of tube is inserted through the nose, and the other is surgically placed in the stomach.

, Because your child has trouble feeding, they may not be getting the calories needed to grow and thrive. Because of this, you may need to alter the food you are giving them. Talk to your doctor about any dietary changes you may need to make for your baby.You may need to give your baby a higher calorie formula to make sure they are getting the daily calories needed to function. If you are breastfeeding, you may need to add formula to the breast milk to up the calorie content.
You may need to manually squeeze formula into your baby’s mouth to ensure they are getting it.

, Since children with PWS have hormonal imbalances that cause them to overeat and obsess about food, you should carefully manage your child’s food intake. Children with PWS are not able to manage their food on their own. They have a tendency to hoard food if not watched closely.You should carefully portion out your child’s food for each meal and snack. Children do not need as much food as adults. This means a child’s portion size will be smaller than an adult’s. Don’t feed your child the same size portion you are feeding yourself.
Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about the proper calorie and portion guidelines for children with PWS. There are also books you can buy to help you learn how to feed your child properly.

, Giving your child a routine when it comes to eating can help establish stability with their eating habits. It may also help teach appropriate eating habits. Make a schedule in which your child eats every two or three hours. Snacks should be scheduled just like meals. Refrain from giving food between scheduled meal times, because that can lead to unhealthy habits, reinforce negative behavior (like that tantrums will lead to food), and give the child too many calories.Eat when your child eats. Try not to eat when your child cannot eat. Consuming food in front of your child that they cannot have may cause a tantrum because they want the food, too.
Tell relatives, friends, and other people not to give food to your child outside of their schedule. Explain that the child may throw tantrums, lie, or try anything to get food, but they have to be on a strict schedule. Tell well-meaning relatives that “a little bit won’t hurt” doesn’t apply to your child. There is no grey area where their diet is concerned.

, Children with PWS cannot feed themselves. They often overeat, steal food, obsess about food, and lie about food. This means an adult in the family should always be in charge of the child’s food. Teach your child from the beginning that they do not get food for themselves, but that an adult will always give them food.Place all food and snacks onto the plate before giving them to your child. Don’t have them a box of crackers or leave serving bowls on the dinner table. This can trigger overeating, food hoarding, or a tantrum if they child wants the food they see but cannot have.
When you go to events, like birthday parties or family get togethers, decide if your child is able to have a small treat without triggering unhealthy food behavior or behavior problems. If this will cause a negative response, consider bringing approved treats from home.

, Healthy eating is important for all members of a family, but a child with PWS needs to eat healthy foods and stay away from calorie-heavy, unhealthy foods. PWS causes slower metabolic function, which means the child has trouble burning calories. Most people with PWS only need between 1,000 to 1,200 calories even as adults.When children with PWS eat empty, unhealthy calories, they don’t burn them, which means it turns to unhealthy fat.Make healthy meals for your family, full of low-fat meats, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Limit the amount of fast food, prepackaged snacks, and junk food your child eats.
If your child wants to eat a lot, give them healthy, low-calorie foods. For example, each day they can have up to eight servings of vegetables, three servings of complex carbohydrates, four servings of fruit, two servings of low-fat dairy products, and one or two servings of meat., Children with PWS often engage in troublesome behaviors where food it concerned. They may steal food, hoard food, or lie about their eating habits. Because they are obsessed with food and often overeat, you should lock all the food away. Place locks on the refrigerator and cabinets, or place all food in locked pantries or cabinets children cannot reach.Since PWS often leads to food-seeking behavior, placing food on high shelves or out of reach may not be enough to stop the behavior.

, Because of the slow metabolic function of the body when someone has PWS, physical activity is important. PWS makes it difficult to burn unused calories, so children should be raised with the habit of getting physical activity and exercising.Children with PWS may not be able to do the same amount or type of physical activity as other children because of reduced energy levels. Have them be active throughout the day in small increments, such as five to fifteen minutes, so they don’t get tired or frustrated.
Individual activities are generally better than team sports. Try walking, swimming, bike riding, gym exercising, or other things they can do by themselves.This helps to reduce the risk of obesity as the child ages, and sets up healthy habits for the future.

, Learning how to manage everything associated with your child's condition may take a toll on you. You may benefit from finding a support group. Support groups can help you come up with diet and food choices, give suggestions for behavioral techniques, and share stories, difficulties, and successes.You can find online support at Prader-Willi California Foundation. You can search online for PWS support groups in your area.

Wait patiently.,
Use over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Take oral contraceptives.,
Consider surgery.",How to Treat Ovarian Cysts1," Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cyst. Most often, the first course of action is to wait. Functional cysts often disappear on their own within a few cycles. The cysts may be monitored by ultrasounds every one to three cycles to determine if the cysts are getting smaller or not., Pain relievers can help alleviate the pain connected to ovarian cysts. Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, NSAIDs, like Aleve or Advil, and aspirin, like Bayer, can help., Your physician may prescribe oral contraceptives to control and prevent some forms of ovarian cysts. Oral contraceptives are useful in both preventing and sometimes treating ovarian cysts. If you are using the oral contraceptives for birth control, you will probably be put on a regular dose. If the oral contraceptives are being used only to treat the cysts, the dose will be the lowest possible for the shortest period of time.Taking birth control pills decreases the risk of some types of ovarian cysts, but carry their own risks. These include an increased risk of cancer of the breast, cervix, and liver, heart disease, and stroke., Surgery to treat ovarian cysts is very rare. However, if your cyst looks large, is recurrent, or there are multiple cysts, your doctor may suggest that they be surgically removed. Your doctor may also consider removing the cyst if it causes a lot of pain or other problems. This treatment option needs to be discussed with your doctor."

Use a heat pad.,
Try castor oil.,
Take a warm bath.,
Drink herbal tea.,
Change your diet.,
Consider rebalancing your hormones using natural progesterone.,
Rebalance your hormones using herbs.",How to Treat Ovarian Cysts2," Heat can be used to relax muscles and relieve any cramping that you may be experience. You can use either a heating pad or a hot water bottle. Place either on your lower abdomen for about 15 minutes. You can repeat this 3-4 times a day., Castor oil has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used as a traditional treatment for any kind of menstrual pain. It may improve the blood flow during the menstrual period.Start by applying enough castor oil on your lower abdomen to completely coat the area.
Take a large, clean, cotton towel and cover your lower abdomen. Then, use either a heating pad or a hot water bottle and place it over the towel.
Leave the heat and towel on for at least 30 minutes. Repeat four to five times a week.

, A warm bath may help to relax the muscles in your abdomen. Soaking in hot water may also relieve cramping., Drinking herbal teas can help relieve the pain of ovarian cysts. Try teas such as chamomile, mint, raspberry, and blackberry. These teas may help reduce tension in your muscles and calm your mood., Diets full of meat and cheese may cause more ovarian cysts. Instead, eat more fruits and vegetables as part of your regular diet. This may help reduce ovarian cysts.A healthy diet also helps prevent obesity, which can lead to more ovarian cysts.

, Progesterone can inhibit ovulation, thus decreasing the likelihood of ovarian cysts. This approach should only be used when working with your physician. Even though creams are available online, you need to be working with someone to ensure there are no complications.Beginning 10 days after the beginning of your last menstrual period (Day 10 of the cycle), use a natural progesterone cream. Apply on your inner thigh or behind your knees. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.

, The following herbs can be used to rebalance the natural hormone levels. When using any of these products,follow manufacturer’s instructions.


Maca is a root vegetable from Peru that has traditionally been used to treat fertility and energy issues. Maca may be beneficial in balancing hormonal levels. It is commonly used for these purposes in treating menopause.Chaste berry is traditionally used to balance reproductive herbs and may help decrease the pain, discomfort, and the size of ovarian cysts. It is being studied for its effects in PMS to reduce pain."

Monitor pelvic pain.,
Look for other symptoms of ovarian cysts.,
Be aware of the risk factors.,
Schedule a doctor’s appointment.",How to Treat Ovarian Cysts3," Pelvic pain may be a symptom of ovarian cysts. This pain is a dull ache that may radiate to your lower back and thighs. The pain can occur just before your period begins or just before it ends.The pain can occur only during intercourse.
The pain can also occur during bowel movements or if there is any pressure on your bowels.

, Most ovarian cysts are painless and symptomless, and often disappear on their own. These cysts can result in symptoms, however. The symptoms include:Nausea, vomiting, or breast tenderness similar to that experienced during pregnancy
A feeling of abdominal fullness or heaviness
A feeling of pressure on your bladder. This can cause more frequent urination or difficulty emptying the bladder completely

, There are a number of possible risk factors for cysts, and these can play a role in any treatment choices. These include:A history of previous cysts
Irregular menstrual cycles
Beginning menstruation younger than 12
Infertility or a history of infertility treatments
Low thyroid function
Treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer
Smoking and use of tobacco products
Chronic inflammatory conditions

, You should see your doctor regularly if you have had a history of ovarian cysts. If any of the symptoms listed become severe or interfere with your daily life, call your physician. If you have severe abdominal or lower abdominal or pelvic pain, especially when accompanied by fever or nausea or vomiting, seek immediate medical attention.


Let your physician know what home treatments you are pursuing and let your physician know if they are helping.

Watch out for symptoms of disease.",How to Treat No See Um Bites," No-see-um bites usually swell up immediately, so consider where you're at when the bites develop to determine how likely it is for no-see-ums to be present.


These insects can be found in nearly any location with moist soil and fertilizer. Forests, wetlands, farm pastures, and beaches are among the most common breeding grounds, but it's not uncommon for the bugs to exist in your own backyard.No-see-um bites can also occur indoors if a breeding ground is located nearby outdoors.
Keep the season in mind, too. No-see-ums are most active during May and June, when the weather is just beginning to warm up. The problem will usually last for a few weeks before the bugs go away.;
, A no-see-um bite initially appears as a small red dot. This dot can expand into a welt that is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in diameter.When the bug bites, it injects saliva into the skin. This saliva is what causes the welt and the allergic reaction.
Welts usually last for two weeks, give or take a few days.
No-see-um bites are usually very itchy and can become mildly painful.

, No-see-ums can bite multiple times and typically feed in large groups, so you'll usually find clusters of bite welts instead individual ones.


Moreover, no-see-ums do not inject you with a numbing agent as they bite, so you will probably feel each bite as it happens.
Most bites occur on the legs, hands, and back of the neck, but any area of exposed skin is a vulnerable point.

, No-see-ums are aptly named since they are so tiny and difficult to spot. If you do happen to catch sight of the bug that bites you, though, it helps to know what you're looking for.


No-see-ums are only about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) in length. They have wings, but at that size, those wings are hardly visible. At first glance, the insect may look like a flea.

, One of the most important things to do when you have a no-see-um bite is to stop yourself from scratching it.


Scratching the welts can cause them to break open. Once a welt breaks open, it is far more likely to become infected.
It's a good idea to keep your fingernails short and clean for the duration of bite. You may scratch the area without thinking, and if dirt and bacteria are trapped beneath your nails, the site can quickly become infected.

, As soon as you notice the bite-ridden area, gently wash it with a mild antibacterial soap and warm water.


Washing the area immediately helps reduce the risk of infection. It can also get rid of any residual no-see-um saliva sitting on the surface of your skin, thereby reducing the amount of irritation you'll feel.

, When the bites begin to swell, you can stop the swelling by applying a cold compress or ice pack.


Soak a clean washcloth in cold water and gently press it over the bite area for 10 minutes to reduce initial swelling.
To numb pain or more severe swelling, wrap several ice cubes in a clean washcloth and press that against the bite site. You could also use a bag of frozen vegetables. Numb the area in 10 to 15 minute intervals as needed for the first 24 hours.

, Heat water to an approximate temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). Dunk the tip of a cotton swab in the water, then apply the scalding water directly over the bite.This treatment works best for bites that itch but don't hurt.
When you apply the hot water, expect the bite to sting slightly for several seconds. The stinging should stop quickly, however, and the itch should be subdued.
Only use this application two or three times per bite.
Never apply scalding water using anything larger than a cotton swab. Too much can cause a burn.

, A standard over-the-counter analgesic cream can usually reduce pain associated with no-see-um bites, while a standard antihistamine can relieve itching.


Always follow the package instructions to determine proper application and dosage. Usually, you will need to apply a thin layer of the medication directly over the bite using your fingers.
Use a cream, ointment, or other rub for best results. Sprays are not as effective against insect bite relief.
Counterirritant analgesics may work best for painful bug bite relief. Ingredients in these treatments create a burning or cooling sensation that can distract the mind from the pain caused by the bite.

, If topical analgesics and antihistamines are not effective, try a cortisone cream, instead.


Cortisone creams tend to be a little stronger than antihistamines and work in a different manner. They essentially block the body from releasing chemicals or activating cells that can worsen itching and swelling.
Follow the package instructions carefully and never apply more than directed.

, Obtain an over-the-counter zinc cream or ointment. Apply the product as directed on the package.


Zinc creams are often used against rashes and minor skin irritations.
Apply a thin layer directly over the bite and cover the area with a bandage to prevent the cream from getting wiped away. Immediately stop use if your symptoms worsen.

, The plant possesses qualities that help numb pain and itchiness.


Apply a generous amount of aloe vera gel over the entire affected area. It is usually safe to use large quantities of aloe vera, but as always, you should follow the label instructions when applying this treatment.

, Topical treatments usually have the highest odds of success, but in some cases, an over-the-counter oral drug might be more effective.


Treat pain and inflammation with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like aspirin or ibuprofen.Use an oral antihistamine to treat itchiness or other signs of mild to moderate allergic reaction, like hives.

, If you experience an abnormally severe allergic reaction, you might need prescription treatment.


For severe swelling, your doctor may prescribe prescription antihistamines or corticosteroids.
If you experience wheezing, difficulty swallowing, or swelling/itching anywhere else on your body other than the location of the bite, seek emergency medical treatment. Such reactions may need to be treated with an injection of adrenaline or a similar intravenous medication., Infection is the main risk you face when dealing with no-see-um bites. If you suspect that an infection has developed, you should contact your doctor.


Common signs of infection include fever, headache, and nausea. Swollen glands are also symptomatic of infection.
Observe the bite. Bites that are filled with pus or abnormally tender after several days are typically infected.
An infected bite may need to be treated with an oral antibiotic. Take this medication as instructed by your doctor.

, While it is rare, no-see-ums can spread disease through their bites. This is an even greater risk if you got the bites while staying in a tropical climate.


Leishmaniasis is the disease most commonly spread by no-see-ums, even though the risk of getting this disease is still quite small. It occurs when the insect passes a certain protozoan parasite into the body through its saliva.Symptoms can vary, but aggressive skin sores that develop after the standard two-week welt period almost always form. Other symptoms can include fever, weight loss, cough, diarrhea, lethargy, and anemia. If left untreated, leishmaniasis can be fatal.

Examine for signs of a massive pulmonary embolism.A massive pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) may be a cause of obstructive shock.,
Evaluate for a possible tension pneumothorax.A tension pneumothorax is another possible cause of obstructive shock.,
Watch for symptoms of a cardiac tamponade.A cardiac tamponade is when blood pools around the heart, causing a buildup of pressure and a subsequent inability for the heart to effectively pump blood around the body.,
Look for ""constrictive pericarditis"" as a possible cause of obstructive shock.Constrictive pericarditis occurs when the sac around the heart (called the pericardium) becomes inflamed and tightens with scar tissue over time.,
Evaluate for aortic stenosis as a possible cause of obstructive shock.Aortic stenosis is when the valve that allows blood to exit the heart becomes tightened, blocked, or otherwise compressed, leading to a reduced amount of blood that can effectively leave the heart with each heartbeat.When aortic stenosis becomes very severe, it can lead to obstructive shock by significantly reducing the amount of blood that can exit the heart, and thus reducing blood flow to the body's vital organs.,
Remove the clot from a massive PE (pulmonary embolism).If a pulmonary embolism is confirmed as the cause of obstructive shock, it is key to have this treated as soon as possible.,
Use needle decompression and a chest tube to treat a tension pneumothorax.If a tension pneumothorax is responsible for the onset of obstructive shock, insert a needle in the affected area for decompression.,
Opt for pericardiocentesis to treat a cardiac tamponade.,
Treat the underlying cause of constrictive pericarditis as needed.If constrictive pericarditis (or a related condition) is responsible for obstructive shock, it is key to determine what is causing compression and tightening of the heart sac (called the ""pericardium"").,
Treat severe aortic stenosis if this is the underlying cause of shock.An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) can be used to help open the aortic valve.,
Improve the person's blood pressure.One of the cardinal problems in any type of shock (including obstructive shock) is a dangerously low blood pressure.,
Increase the person's blood volume.In addition to improving heart contractility and blood vessel tone through medications, doctors will also consider other ways to increase a person's blood volume when they are in shock, and thus to raise the blood pressure.,
Proceed with CPR until the person is resuscitated.If the shock is severe enough for a person to have become unconscious and pulseless, follow CPR and advanced life saving protocols to resuscitate them, while simultaneously removing or alleviating the cause of the obstruction (in obstructive shock).",How to Treat Obstructive Shock," It presents with sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and the ensuing signs of shock. A massive PE can be investigated for by getting a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) or CT angio of the chest.. This is the fastest way to determine whether one is present and, if so, its exact location., It presents with decreased breath sounds on the affected side, a trachea (windpipe) that has deviated from the midline, chest pain and problems breathing. It most commonly occurs in younger individuals following an accident or trauma. However, it can occur in anyone, often after a change in pressure such as an airplane trip.


A tension pneumothorax can generally be diagnosed clinically, and treated immediately when it is suspected as the cause of obstructive shock.

, The more blood that pools, the less effective circulation becomes, which is what leads to the signs and symptoms of shock.


A cardiac tamponade often presents with anxiety, sudden chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing, trouble breathing, lightheadedness and/or fainting, and pale/grey/bluish skin that results from poor circulation., This, in turn, puts stress on the heart by causing the space in which the heart beats to become more and more enclosed. ""Bacterial pericarditis"" (an infection of the pericardium - the sac around the heart) may also cause obstructive shock by a similar mechanism.


Constrictive pericarditis often presents with trouble breathing, a swollen abdomen as well as swollen legs and ankles (due to the back-up of blood that has trouble getting back into the heart), and chest pain, as well as possible signs of obstructive shock in more severe cases.

,


Aortic stenosis often presents with chest pain, lightheadedness and/or fainting, a gradual decrease in exercise tolerance over time, palpitations (the feeling of unusual heartbeats), and a heart murmur that can be heard through a stethoscope.It is a condition that gradually gets worse with time and, in the most severe cases, may lead to the signs and symptoms of obstructive shock.

, Sometimes a ""thrombolytic"" (clot-busting) drug can be considered to treat a large pulmonary embolism. However, in cases of severe shock, surgery or a catheter removal is usually the fastest and most effective way to remove the PE and thus relieve the obstruction.

, This procedure is called a ""needle decompression."" Following insertion of the needle, treatment of the pneumothorax, and stabilization of shock symptoms, you will get a chest tube for ongoing management to prevent any recurrence of the tension pneumothorax.

, This procedure also involves using a needle. However, in this case, the needle is used to remove fluid from the pericardial sac.Removal of the fluid (normally blood) from the pericardial sac in turn relieves the pressure on the heart, and removes the obstruction that was the underlying cause of shock.


Of course, it is key to determine what caused the cardiac tamponade in order to have complete and lasting resolution of shock.
The needle pericardiocentesis can be done repeatedly, if necessary, to alleviate pressure on the heart until the underlying cause is resolved. In other cases, a surgical procedure known as a pericardial window is done to relieve the accumulation of the fluid.

, If this is unable to be resolved and treated promptly, the heart sac (pericardium) may need to be cut open surgically to relieve pressure on the heart, and to resolve the symptoms of obstructive shock.

, This, in turn, will allow blood to exit the heart and to more effectively supply the body's vital organs. The IABP intervention has been shown to relieve symptoms of obstructive shock when aortic stenosis is diagnosed as the underlying etiology (cause). The aortic valve should be evaluated, and replaced if it meets the criteria.

, A blood pressure above 90 mm Hg systolic is needed to provide adequate blood flow and oxygen to the body's vital organs. Anything below this (which is typical in shock) compromises vital organ function and may lead to multi-organ failure and even death, if not promptly treated and reversed.


A doctor can provide medications (called ""vasopressors"") to contract the blood vessels, and in turn increase the blood pressure.
A doctor can also provide medications (called ""inotropes"") to increase the contractility of the heart, which improves the perfusion to the peripheral tissues.

, Ways to increase blood volume include:


Administering IV fluids such as normal saline or Ringer's lactate. Both of these add fluid volume to the blood vessels, helping to improve blood pressure and blood flow to the vital organs.
Administering a blood transfusion in cases where the patient is anemic. A blood transfusion is less frequently helpful in cases of obstructive shock (as opposed to other types of shock). However, in cases of severe shock, it may be considered as a last resort.

, If you are not a trained medical professional, call 911 and get the person to the hospital as quickly as possible.

Get diagnosed by a health professional.,
Use a Nystatin rinse.,
Use miconazole gel.,
Use prescription lozenges.,
Take prescription pills.,
Treat oral thrush if your baby has given it to you.,
Replace anything that may have gone in your mouth while you had thrush.",How to Treat Oral Thrush1," Doctors and dentists are generally able to diagnose oral thrush simply by looking at the lesions in your mouth. However, some may still do an oral swab to be sure that you have thrush.


Make sure that you visit a physician if you suspect that you have thrush. Oral thrush can spread and it may become a serious problem. Do not try to treat it on your own.;
, Nystatin Swish and Swallow is a commonly prescribed medication for thrush. It helps to clear up infections and yeast growths. To use this medication, swish the medication in your mouth for several minutes, and then swallow it to clear the throat and esophagus.


Make sure that you swallow the medication after you finish swishing it. Otherwise, you may develop esophagitis, which is an infection of the esophagus.
A common dosage of Nystatin suspension is 100,000 U/mL taken between four to six times every day., Miconazole gel is currently available as an over-the-counter drug for oral thrush. The most common brand for miconazole is Daktarin oral gel. Extra precautionary measures should be considered before starting the miconazole treatment for people who have liver conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and infants below six months.Apply a pea-sized amount of gel directly to the lesions. If you don’t know how to properly apply the gel, read the instructions that come along with it.

, Nystatin or clotrimazole may also be used in the form of a troche (a lozenge that is dissolved in the mouth). Allow one lozenge to dissolve in your mouth, swishing it gently so that it makes contact with all the surfaces in your mouth. Make sure that you swallow periodically to clear up any infection in your throat.Whether the medication is a rinse or a lozenge, continue using it for at least 48 hours after the symptoms have disappeared.
Nystatin pastilles: 200,000 U each, given 4 times a day for 1-2 weeks., If a rinse or lozenge is not successful in clearing up oral thrush, or if the infection has spread beyond the mouth, you will have to take pills to clear up the infection. The oral treatment prescribed is typically fluconazole or an echinocandin. The medication the doctor chooses to prescribe depends on the strain of Candida and on the individual patient (how ill he or she is, whether other illnesses are also present, allergies, and other factors).Oral antifungal medications you can take includes clotrimazole (Mycelex) and fluconazole (Diflucan), which are taken by mouth.Fluconazole is generally prescribed as 400 mg pills; two are taken the first day, then one per day after that. While oral thrush may appear to be gone within the first 2 days of taking medication, it is important to continue the recommended treatment which usually is about 2 weeks.Echinocandin is prescribed as caspofungin at 70 mg on the first day, then 50 mg daily; or, anidulafungin at 200 mg on the first day, then 100 mg daily., If thrush occurs in a baby who is breastfeeding, the mother may have a Candida infection around her nipples. In this case, the nipples will usually be red, flaky, and itchy, and may be painful during breastfeeding. Two ways to treat this infection include:


Nystatin cream: This may be prescribed by the mother’s physician; the usual dose is two to three times per day.

, It is important to sanitize or replace items that may go into the mouth to prevent oral thrush from returning. Replace your toothbrush (or its head, if it’s an electronic one) with a new one. If you wear dentures, soak them overnight in a denture cleaning solution.For babies, boil items such as pacifiers and bottle nipples that are used in the mouth. Wash all dishes in hot water (over 122 degrees), and do not share used dishes or utensils with family members.

Ask your doctor before you try any home remedies for thrush.,
Take a probiotic.,
Eat yogurt.,
Use a homemade rinse.,
Try gentian violet to get rid of oral thrush.,
Take vitamins and minerals.,
Make sure to eat essential fatty acids.,
Take propolis.,
Use herbal treatments.",How to Treat Oral Thrush2," Keep in mind that thrush can spread and may become serious if it is not treated properly, so it is best to check with your doctor before you try any home remedies. You should be especially cautious if you have a lowered immune system due to illness, such as HIV or cancer., Taking probiotics (healthy bacteria) may help clear up thrush, as the healthy bacteria crowd out the invading fungus and restore the normal balance in the mucus membranes. Look for a probiotic supplement that contains at least five billion CFUs (colony forming units) per dose, and take it two to three times daily.If the affected person is a baby or a child, you can open the capsules and sprinkle them on the child’s food, or make a paste from the powder in the capsules and spread it inside the baby’s mouth.

, You can also get your probiotics from a fermented foods, such as yogurt. However, the dose you receive will be much lower and may be less effective.


Choose unsweetened yogurt, since sugar will cause the Candida to grow faster.
Eat yogurt once or twice daily making sure to eat slowly and leave a spoonful of yogurt in your mouth as close to the lesions as possible for about 30 seconds before swallowing it.There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy on probiotics in yogurt cultures but, in general, this regimen has few negative side effects., There are several different kinds of rinses you can try that will get rid of oral thrush. The instructions are the same for each one: swish the solution in your mouth two to four times a day and then spit it out. The rinses include:


Saltwater: 1/2 tsp of salt in one of cup water.Apple cider vinegar: one tablespoon of vinegar in one cup of water.
Tea tree oil: a few drops of oil in one cup of water. Tea tree oil is toxic if swallowed, so it should only be used as a rinse., An older remedy for thrush is a dye called gentian violet. No prescription is necessary to get gentian violet. Take a small amount on a cotton swab and lightly cover the affected areas. One treatment should be sufficient. Because it is a dye, be careful not to get it on any clothing or other items you don’t want stained; wear gloves while using it and keep it off of the lips, as it will temporarily stain the skin purple.


Use this remedy in consultation with your physician, as it may cause ulcers in the mouth, and has been linked to oropharyngeal cancer in a recent study.Gentian violet should not be swallowed, as it can be be toxic to the body when absorbed systemically.

, Taking vitamin C, as well as other vitamins and minerals, can benefit you by maintaining your immune system and helping to fight off infection while also reducing inflammation. Some suggested dosages are: Vitamin C - 500mg to 1000mg per day
Vitamin E - 200 IU to 400 IU per day
Selenium - 200 mcg per day

, These can help your body to reduce inflammation, while providing additional benefits such as reducing animal fats from your regular diet. For example, omega-6, also known as evening primrose, can be taken alongside omega-3 (fish oil) at a dosing of 2 tablespoons oil per day, or 1000mg to 1500mg twice per day.You can also take caprylic acid. This supplement can be taken in a dosing of 1 gram along with your meals. Caprylic acid is a fatty acid that may confer some antifungal properties., This is a naturally occurring substance obtained from pine resin. It is created by bees and laboratory testing has demonstrated positive antifungal results. Take note, however, if you have allergies to honey or have asthma, you should discuss this as a treatment option prior to starting on any regimen., It is important to evaluate herbal supplements (and the possible medication interactions) with your doctor prior to beginning any treatments. While herbs can confer health benefits, they can also contribute to negative interactions and outcomes to your health. Beneficial herbal supplements that may help oral thrush include:


Garlic - Garlic is known to have antifungal properties. Generally, dosing is one clove of garlic per day (equivalent to 4,000 to 5,000 mcg of allicin). Garlic can interact with medication, increasing the risk of bleeding, and is known to interact with blood thinners, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (coumadin), or aspirin. HIV medications can also be affected by garlic.Echinacea- Echinacea derived juice has been demonstrated to confer resistance against vaginal yeast infections that occur frequently. Taking between 2ml to 4ml each day can help to fight against this. Again, echinacea can interact with medications and it is important to discuss potential complications with your doctor prior to beginning a regimen.Tea Tree oil - Tea tree oil has been shown in various studies to have antifungal properties when used as a mouthwash, effectively treating oral thrush. Tea tree oil can be toxic when ingested orally, so be sure to only use this as a mouthwash (after discussing with your physician).
Pomegranate - Yes, pomegranate gel has been demonstrated to help fight oral thrush almost as effectively as miconazole gel in one study that associated with denture stomatitis."

Descend to a lower altitude.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Allow your body to rest.",How to Treat Mild Altitude Illness1," If you start to experience any symptoms of mild altitude sickness, such as a headache, lightheadedness, or lung pain, you should descend by at least 500m or 1,600 feet. This will give your body time to acclimatize to the altitude and relieve your symptoms.You should avoid attempting to go to higher altitudes for two to three days, or until your symptoms have disappeared. Severe altitude sickness can be fatal, so if you notice your symptoms getting worse, make sure you descend to a much lower height.
Signs of severe altitude sickness include confusion, drowsiness, convulsions, shortness of breath (even while at rest), clumsiness or difficulty walking, double vision, irrational behavior, a bubbling sound in the chest and/or coughing up a white or pink frothy liquid.;
, Once you have descended to a lower altitude, you should stay hydrated by drinking lots of water. Avoid drinking alcohol, as it can dehydrate you further.You should also avoid any smoking or inhaled products (including vaping) that are not medicine, as this can make it more difficult for you to breathe. It can also worsen your symptoms.

, Do not do any exercise or intense physical movements, as your body needs time to recover from altitude illness. You should rest for at least two to three days, or until your symptoms subside.Do not take sleeping pills to help you rest while you have altitude illness, as they can slow your breathing further and lead to complications."
"
Use bottled oxygen.,
Take anti-sickness medication.,
Get a prescription for altitude medication from your doctor.",How to Treat Mild Altitude Illness2," You can treat altitude sickness by using bottled oxygen or portable hyperbaric chambers, also known as Gamow or Certic bags.; however, bottled oxygen should not be used as a substitute for descending to a lower altitude.You will be zipped into a portable hyperbaric chamber and then the chamber will be pumped full of air. You will usually spend one to two hours in the chamber until your symptoms go away.
You can carry a portable oxygen chamber with you as part of your high-altitude gear in the event of altitude illness.

, You can also take an anti-emetic, a known anti-sickness medication, to help with symptoms like nausea or vomiting. You can find antiemetic medication over the counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.If you are experiencing headaches due to altitude illness, you can also take painkillers like ibuprofen or paracetamol. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.

, You can also get prescription medication for altitude illness from your doctor, as prescription medication is often stronger than over the counter pills. The most commonly prescribed altitude medication is acetazolamide (Diamox), which has been shown to improve the symptoms of mild altitude illness.If you have developed mild altitude illness previously, your doctor may prescribe dexamethasone or nifedipine, which can help to stabilize the blood-flow pattern in your lungs.

"
"
Allow your body to acclimatize to high altitudes.,
Stay hydrated.,
Bring oxygen tanks with you as part of your travel gear.",How to Treat Mild Altitude Illness3," You can prevent altitude sickness by allowing your body to adapt to the change in oxygen concentration at higher altitudes over a period of time. Climb to higher levels at a slow pace so your body gets used to the altitude.Start at below 10,000 feet and walk to high altitudes, rather than drive or fly. When you climb or hike above 10,000 feet, you should increase your altitude by no more than 1,000 feet a day. Try to have a rest day scheduled for every 3,000 feet gained, or every three days of climbing.
If you climb more than 1,000 feet a day, you should come down to sleep at a lower altitude. Follow the mantra, “Climb high and sleep low.”

, You should drink at least three to four quarts or 12 to 16 cups of water a day. This will ensure you are well hydrated as you climb to higher altitudes.You should also avoid consuming alcohol, tobacco, and sleeping pills when you are climbing to higher altitudes.
Try to maintain a diet that consists of more than 70% carbohydrates, as this will ensure you get enough nutrients at higher altitudes.
If you are at risk of developing low oxygen levels in your blood, a medical condition known as anemia, your doctor may recommend you take an iron supplement to help maintain optimal blood oxygen levels on your climb or hike.

, You should bring oxygen tanks with you as part of your gear if you are planning to climb or hike above 10,000 feet. You should have enough oxygen to last several days.You can buy oxygen tanks at your local outdoor store or online.

Create a treatment plan with your doctor.,
Stabilize your breathing and heart functions.,
Request mobility aids.,
Request a prescription for your physical therapy.,
Ask for recommendations of physical therapists who specialize in muscular dystrophy.,
Begin physical therapy treatment with supervised exercise.,
Begin low-impact cardiovascular exercise.,
Develop a range-of-motion exercise routine.,
Return to your physical therapist to adjust your exercises.",How to Treat Muscular Dystrophy With Physical Therapy," Many people suffering from this disease begin using corticosteroid medications; however, they come with risks of bone fracture. Discuss your options with your doctor at the onset of the disease, if possible.;
, Exercise can lead to an increase in blood pressure and shortness of breath, so make sure you undergo tests on your cardiovascular and respiratory systems before you start doing physical therapy.


Doctors may prescribe an oxygen machine, sleep apnea device or ventilators for muscular dystrophy patients that have problems with breathing.
In severe cases, a pacemaker may be inserted into the body to regulate the beating of the heart.

, If you are suffering from muscle weakness, your doctor may prescribe a cane, wheelchair or walker to reduce the risk of falling. Your doctor may recommend that you try a full physical therapy regime first before using an aid, or they may suggest you use an aid when performing the exercises.

, Using a service that is requested by your doctor and supported by your health insurance company will reduce the cost of physical therapy. Inquire about physical therapy appointment limits with your insurance company.

, People with specialized knowledge of the condition are more likely to be effective. Call several physical therapy offices to inquire about their experience with your specific type of muscular dystrophy.

, It may take several weeks or months before you are able to develop an at-home exercise routine. Undergo an initial consultation.

, Under the guidance of your physical therapist, begin regular swimming, walking on flat surfaces and/or bike riding. Schedule exercise that is energizing, rather than tiring.


For example, schedule a 10 to 20 minute walk or swim every day rather than an hour of activity every few days. Exercise that encourages cramping the next day will not have the positive impact that light to moderate exercise will.
The aim of regular exercise is to keep muscles in shape. It can also reduce weight, leaving a lower burden on joints, tendons and muscles.

, These prescribed exercises are tailored to your body to promote joint flexibility. Doing these exercises every day is likely to increase mobility and lessen your risk of contractures.


For example, a type of range-of-motion exercise for the shoulders involves raising your arms over your head. You would first grasp your weaker arm with your stronger arm at the wrist, then raise it above your head.
These exercises should be simple enough to begin at home and do regularly. Stop the exercise immediately if it causes a severe increase in pain. You should not try to push your joints past the point where they move.
Sometimes, doing exercises after warming up with cardiovascular activity will increase your mobility further.

, Muscular dystrophy patients must adjust their exercise routine as the condition progresses. Return every few months to assess any changes that need to be made in your plan.

Age. Infants and young children are more likely to develop lead poisoning from chewing paint chips or inhaling lead dust. Children absorb lead into their bloodstreams more easily than adults.
Residence. Living in older homes can expose you to lead paints, which were banned in the 1970s.
Hobbies. Making stained glass, which requires the use of lead solder, and refinishing old furniture can expose you to lead.
Country of origin. Persons living in developing countries are at a higher risk because these places often have less stringent laws on lead exposure.;

Declined mental function
Numbness or tingling in the extremities
Headache
Memory loss
Mood disorders
Reduced sperm count
Miscarriage or premature birth

, If you develop any signs or symptoms of lead poisoning, or even suspect it, visit your doctor as soon as possible. Not treating lead poisoning can affect brain development in children, and cause issues with the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. It can also lead to death.Your doctor may order tests, such as a blood test, to definitively diagnose lead poisoning. She will likely look for signs of iron deficiency (anemia), which is associated with lead toxicity, and may also conduct a physical examination. From here, she can formulate a treatment plan.Some doctors may test children for lead poisoning as a part of regular check ups., The first and most important part of treatment for lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination.For persons with lower levels of lead in the body, removing the contaminant may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.Contact your local health department, which can recommend ways to identify the source of the contamination in your home or community.You may want to hire a professional who can locate and abate lead contamination. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a service to help you locate Certified Renovation and Lead Dust Sampling Technician Firms, which can help you remove your problem.The service is available at http://www2.epa.gov/lead.

, If you have higher levels of lead in your body, your doctor may prescribe that you undergo chelation therapy.This treatment can help your body excrete lead in your urine with medication.Chelation therapy uses mineral ions or cations that bond with lead in your body. Once this bond is formed, the mineral ions or cations help your body excrete the lead in your urine.Chelation therapy in children may be at lower levels than in adults.Chelation therapy is often given for either a 19 day course or two separate five day courses.,


Severe lead intoxication is a medical emergency — chelation therapy can be a life-saving treatment.

, In some adults, your doctor may suggest treatment with three different drugs, which are commonly called ethylene diaminete traacetic acid, or EDTA.Undergo these treatments if you have a severe case of lead poisoning, but be aware that it may not be possible to reverse damage.This is particularly true if the lead has entered your bone.You may require more than one treatment of EDTA to remove lead from your body.EDTA is administered intravenously.There is some evidence that intravenous administration of the medication may be more effective at removing lead than oral preparations., Children often develop lead poisoning as a result of hand to mouth ingestion.Washing their hands and toys often and thoroughly can help minimize the risk of contamination.Wash your child’s hands in warm water with a mild soap for at least 20 seconds after outdoor play, before eating, and at bedtime.Use a hand sanitizer if you cannot access soap and water., Clean dust off of surfaces in your home on a regular basis. This can remove and cut down on lead dust and small particles and minimize your risk for developing lead poisoning.Wipe furniture, windowsills, and other surfaces containing dust with a wet cloth. Mop your floors on a regular basis, too.Keeping windows closed and using an air conditioner may cut down on the amount of dust in your home.

, Soil, which children may put in their mouths, can expose them to lead. Keeping them away from bare soil and making them wash their hands frequently may help prevent lead exposure and poisoning.If you have exposed soil, cover it with grass or mulch.If you are able, provide your children with a sandbox that you cover between uses., A healthy diet can help your body lower lead absorption.Children in particular need sufficient calcium and iron in their diets to help lower possible lead exposure.Adults should get between 1,800 – 2,200 calories per day, depending on activity level, age, weight, and sex. Infants to three year olds should get between 900 and 100 calories per day, while children between the ages of 4 and 13 need a range of 1200 – 1600 calories daily.Eat vitamin- and nutrient-dense foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and lean proteins.Children need about two to three cups of dairy per day, which will provide them with their recommended dose of calcium.Children can get calcium from milk, cheese, yogurt, dark, leafy greens and oranges.
Children require between .27 mg and 8 mg of iron every day. They can get iron from lean meats and seafood, nuts, and fortified grain products.It’s also important to drink enough water for hydration, which may help excrete lead from your urine. Adults need between nine and 16 cups of water a day. Children need between five and eight glasses depending on age., If you are doing renovations on your home, it’s important to take care during the process, especially if your home is older. This can minimize your risk of exposure to lead and may prevent lead poisoning.Don’t sand surfaces with lead paint. This can create large amounts of lead dust that you could inhale.Don’t remove paint with an open flame torch because this can also create small lead particles that you could ingest.Cover old paint that isn’t particularly chipped and thickly adhering to the wall. You can do this with another coat of paint, drywall, paneling, or encapsulation.Wear protective equipment and clothing such as masks, suits, or articles that you can throw away. Don’t shake out your work clothes or wash them with other clothing.Shower and wash your hair before leaving the site.If you are renovating in or near your kitchen, watch for surfaces that may have lead dust accumulation. Either clean it off or eat someplace with a lower risk of lead exposure."

Maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly.,
Use compression wear.,
Try Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD).,
Consider Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT).,
Learn about liposuction.,
Ask your doctor about pain management.",How to Treat Lipedema1," Though eating healthy and exercising won’t cure the problem, it will help get rid of any fat that is not caused by the disorder.Maintaining a healthy diet and exercising may also help reduce inflammation.
It is important to understand that this disorder is not a result of being obese, and though you may be doing everything right in terms of diet and exercise, you won’t be able to cure the disorder through diet and exercise.;
, This is a fairly straightforward treatment which involves wearing a garment designed to compress the affected area for several hours each day. You will need to discuss what garment is appropriate for your needs with a doctor or therapist.It is believed that wearing compression garments encourages blood flow while also providing support. Additionally, the compression encourages the fluid to move out of the area and drain properly.
If you are experiencing pain because of your lipedema, this treatment option may not be a good option for you.

, MLD is a type of gentle massage that is meant to encourage the flow of the lymphatic fluids in the body. Usually, the massage will be given by a trained professional, and combined with another type of therapy, such as compression therapy.This treatment may also be effective in reducing pain.

, This type of therapy involves combining several non-surgical techniques including use of compression wear, manual lymphatic drainage, exercises meant to help remove lymph from the swollen areas, and skin care to help prevent infections.This type of treatment usually involves two phases. The first phase is an active phase which involves two to 12 weeks of one-hour treatment sessions. These sessions are usually limited to four or five days each week. The second phase is called the maintenance phase and involves giving self-massage to the affected areas, completing exercises, and wearing compression wear or bandages day and night.

, In some severe cases, and if other treatment methods have not helped, you doctor may suggest liposuction as a way to treat the disorder. This is a surgical method, and thus comes with all of the risks.


There are three varieties of liposuction: the dry technique, Water Assisted Liposuction (WAL), and Tumescent Liposuction (TLA). You should discuss which method is right for you.
Generally, liposuction for lipedema patients is more commonly used in European countries than in the USA. Thus, if you live in the US, it may be a bit more challenging to find a surgeon experienced in this method of treatment.

, Unfortunately for many, lipedema is not only disfiguring, it is also painful. The fat on the legs, hips, and buttocks is painful, sensitive to the touch, and bruises quite easily. This can make living a normal life difficult, and only contributes further to the emotional effects of the disorder. If you experience pain with your lipedema, be sure that your doctor knows this. Ask the doctor how you can manage the pain. Some doctors may prescribe pain medications, while others may refer you to a specialist who can teach you various pain management techniques.


Many of the therapies discussed in this article (such as MLD and CDT) work not only to help reduce the swelling but also to reduce pain as much as possible.Being overweight (in addition to lipedema) can contribute further to the pain caused by lipedema. This is why it is especially important to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Many lipedema patients report that swimming offers an excellent way to exercise because it is very low-impact and does not exacerbate the pain.
Other exercises that may offer a good way to reduce stress and improve blood flow include: yoga, pilates, walking, stretching, and bouncing on a trampoline. Try out these exercises to see which (if any) are painful, and which you enjoy most.

"
"
Continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.,
Get regular checkups.,
Take care of any conditions that might exacerbate the disorder.",How to Treat Lipedema2," Some people may feel discouraged when receiving a diagnosis of lipedema. For many people, the extra fat may make it feel as though there is little point in trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle; however, this couldn’t be any further from the truth. Being diagnosed with lipedema means it is more important than ever that you learn to manage the disorder while eating right and exercising on a regular basis.


Ask your doctor about an exercise regimen that will suit your needs. Be sure to point out any exercises that are made painful because of your condition.

, Patients with lipedema often experience other health problems after they are diagnosed with lipedema. Obesity, mental disorders, and problems related the veins are just a few of these possibilities. This means it is extremely important to see your doctor regularly; not only to monitor the lipedema but to monitor your health in general.In some cases, lipedema can advance into a different, but similar disorder known as lymphedema, which may require different treatment methods., There are certain health conditions that can make lipedema symptoms worse. For example, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and health conditions that cause inflammation all tend to worsen the symptoms of lipedema.Make sure that your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking, including any herbal supplements or vitamins. If your doctor prescribes any medication, make sure that you take your medication as instructed.

Join a social support group.,
Consider therapy.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Understand that lipedema is not the result of lifestyle changes.",How to Treat Lipedema3," Being diagnosed with lipedema can be a shock, and dealing with the physical symptoms of the disorder leaves many people feeling very self-conscious. Finding a support group that helps you realize you are not alone is a great way to help cope with the psychological effects of this disorder.There are many blogs, forums, and other social media groups aimed at creating a positive, supportive community for people suffering from lipedema. The lipedema project is an organization aimed at helping people find a supportive place to learn about and talk about their lipedema., For many people, being diagnosed with lipedema is very difficult to deal with. You might have a good social support system in place already, but having an objective person that has an outside perspective can be a great way to talk about your feelings in a safe environment.


Additionally, a trained mental health professional will be able to help you strengthen your coping skills, and give you new ways to think about your diagnosis. This is in addition to listening to your worries about the disorder, which is very helpful for many people.

, When you are diagnosed with lipedema you may start to realize that there are people in your life who don’t have your best interest at heart. Right after diagnosis, you may be very vulnerable to the opinions of others, and it won’t do you any good to sit around listening to negativity. Instead, surround yourself with the people who make you feel better.


This doesn’t mean you have to cut off contact with everyone who isn’t always a shining beacon of positivity. Instead, try to distance yourself from those people while you are learning to cope with your diagnosis.

, Many people diagnosed with the disorder may feel as though the disease is a result of eating too much junk food or not getting enough exercise. It is important to remember that this is not the case. Though the cause of the disease is not 100% clear, doctors believe that it is likely related to hormonal changes (e.g. when puberty begins or during pregnancy) and that it is a genetic disorder that is passed down.Thus, while you should do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you should accept that no amount of dieting and exercise will cure the problem. Getting enough exercise and making healthy food choices will, however, help you maintain your health as best you can.
Given this information, it is also important to remember that the disorder is not your fault and that you shouldn’t beat yourself up about the disorder.

Identify your symptoms.,
Explain your symptoms and medical history to your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about a skin biopsy.,
Get tested for Lyme disease.,
Get tested for other conditions that can cause itching.,
Gather a team of doctors you trust.,
Support your immune system with a healthy diet.,
Use self-care techniques during bathing.,
Keep your environment clean.,

Stay open-minded about treatments.,
Talk to your doctor about medications.",How to Treat Morgellon's Disease," Morgellon's disease is a skin disorder in which people have itchy sensations on their skin. This may cause them to scratch until they have open sores. Symptoms include:Severe itching caused by sores or a rashThe feeling that insects are crawling under your skin
The feeling that you are being bitten or stung by insects
Fibers or strings in or on your skin.The fibers may be in the sores. Some experts say the fibers are likely from clothing that got stuck in the sores. Others say it is a symptom of an infection.
Exhaustion
Loss of concentration
Memory loss
Sleep problems
Muscle pain
Joint pain
Hair loss
Weight loss or gain
Low body temperature
Loss of balance
Abnormal reflexes
Inflamed lymph nodes
Irritable bowel syndrome
Irregular or fast heartbeat
Decreased vision and hearing;
, Your doctor will likely want to hear about both your symptoms and discuss your medical history. Some doctors believe that the causes for Morgellon's may be at least partially psychological. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that people suffering from Morgellon's disease often had a medical history which included one or more of the following conditions:High blood pressure
Allergies
Arthritis
Skin infections like scabies
Mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, or attention deficit disorder
Drug abuse

, This will enable the doctor to test the affected skin against known infections and environmental factors. This may be useful in ruling out causes other than Morgellon's. Be aware that when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed the skin of patients suffering from Morgellon's, they did not find evidence of an infection. This may support a psychological cause for Morgellon's. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that:No unusual bacteria were infecting the skin samples.
The fibers in the sores were usually those that could have come from clothing or bandages, such as cotton or polyester.
The most frequent skin problem observed was sun damage.

, A recent scientific study found that filaments in the skin of people with Morgellon's were made of keratin and collagen, not from clothing. This supported the conclusion that Morgellon's is associated with the Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease. If you think you may have Morgellon's disease, ask your doctor to test you for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.The testing should be done by a laboratory and clinician who is familiar with Lyme disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that Morgellon's is not always associated with Lyme disease.

, In order to correctly diagnose Morgellon's, it is important that your doctor rule out other causes of severe itching. This may include:Scabies
Body lice
Pin worms
Allergies
Thyroid problems
Kidney malfunctions
Liver problems

, Because Morgellon's is not well understood, you may benefit from the opinions of doctors from different fields. It is important that all of the doctors are thorough in their examinations and that they listen to you and take your symptoms seriously. You may want to consider talking to:Your general practitioner
A dermatologist
A psychologist or psychiatrist
A specialist in Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. You can find doctors who are knowledgeable about Lyme disease by contacting the Lyme Disease Association, International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society, the Tick Borne Disease Alliance, or local Lyme support groups.
Specialists in any other body systems that are affected. For example, if you suffer from vision or hearing problems, add an eye doctor or hearing specialist to your team.

, A healthy diet will help your body repair and heal any wounds you may have. It will also boost your immune system to help you fight any infections that may be present. The Morgellon's Foundation in the UK recommends:Supplying your body with sufficient energy by choosing complex over simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and provide energy for longer. They include whole-grain breads, brown rice, oats, buckwheat, couscous and whole-wheat pastas. Limit your intake of processed sugars including cookies, cakes, and candies.
Get a rich array of vitamins and minerals by eating lots of diverse fruits and vegetables. The vitamins and minerals support important physiological processes in your body, including those necessary for healing. Excellent sources include dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and salads topped with different fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, apples, orange slices, or berries.
Get protein from healthy sources. Eat lean meats like poultry and fish. If you eat red meat, trim the fat off. Vegetarians can get protein from chickpeas and beans.
Cook with herbs that may have antibacterial or antifungal properties. Options to try include: black pepper, cloves, coriander, chilli, cayenne, turmeric, and cumin.

, The Morgellon's Foundation recommends trying several different options to cleanse your wounds and remove any filaments that might be present. Consult your doctor before using these techniques to make sure they will be safe for you, especially if you have open wounds.Exfoliate your skin. This can be done by gently rubbing your skin with a wash cloth or exfoliating glove as you wash. Commercial exfoliating mixtures are widely available at local drug stores. You can also make your own by adding a small amount of salt to the water.
Take a bath with disinfectant mixtures in it. You can soak for 10 minutes in a warm bath that has salt (1.5 kilograms) added to it. Afterwards rinse off with clear water and dry yourself thoroughly. The Morgellon's Foundation also suggests adding other substances like vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and bentonite clay to the water. Consult your doctor first to be sure that they will not irritate your sores.
Massage your skin with olive oil or bentonite clay after bathing. This should be done on unbroken, dry skin. It will help to moisturize your skin and remove any filaments that may be irritating you. Consult a doctor before applying any treatments to your wounds.

, This means being diligent about keeping your house, clothes, and pets clean and well cared for. You can do this by:


Vacuuming your house to reduce irritants like mold spores, hair, pet dander, and dust. Get a dehumidifier if you have mold growing in your house.Washing your clothing and bedding at 60 degrees. Add a small amount of color-safe bleach to the water as a disinfectant.Taking your pets to the veterinarian to make sure that they are not infected with parasites. Keep them up to date on their shots and deworm them as recommended by your vet., Morgellon's is highly uncomfortable and distressing for those who suffer from it. Try to lower your stress levels by taking care of yourself both physically and mentally. You can do this by:


Getting social support. Stay connected with friends and family. If they don’t live nearby you can keep in touch via phone, letters, email or social media.
Finding a support group. Your doctor or local health department may be able to recommend groups near you. You may also be able to find support groups specifically for Morgellon's by searching online at the Morgellon's Foundation website.Exercising. Exercise will relax you physically and emotionally. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins which will lift your mood. General recommendations for adults include 75-150 minutes of exercise per week.Using relaxation techniques. These methods can be used even when you don’t feel well enough to be very physically active. They include meditation , deep breathing , visualizing calming images, progressively tensing and relaxing different muscle groups throughout your body, or doing yoga ., Your doctor may suggest seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist. This may be helpful for two reasons:The physical symptoms are extremely distressing for sufferers, which can lead to depression and anxiety. Treating the depression and anxiety may substantially improve your quality of life.
If there is a psychological component to the disease, treating any underlying conditions may help to resolve the Morgellon's. Find doctors you trust and can speak openly with.

, Because there is no known cure, the medications your doctors suggest may vary depending upon what symptoms you have. Your doctor may suggest:Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections associated with Lyme disease
Antifungal medications to treat skin infections
Anti-parasite medications to kill parasites
Painkillers to deal with muscle and joint pain
Anti-histamine medications to address itching and irritation
Sleep medications to reduce sleep disturbances

Recognize the signs and symptoms of a Listeria infection.Fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea are all common symptoms of listeriosis.,
Allow your immune system to combat the infection naturally.If you do not fall into any of the high-risk categories and appear to have only a mild listeriosis infection (which is the case for the vast majority of people), your doctor will likely advise that you rest and allow your immune system to naturally fight off the infection.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Boost your immune system.",How to Treat Listeria1," In more severe cases, the infection may spread to your nervous system, leading to a stiff neck, a headache, loss of balance, convulsions, and/or an altered level of consciousness.


If you notice any of these more severe signs that indicate a possible spread to your nervous system, seek medical help immediately.
When Listeria infects the nervous system, it could be meningitis (which simply means an infection of the central nervous system, specifically of the meninges) which always requires emergency medical care.
If you have only the basic symptoms of fever, muscle aches, nausea, and/or diarrhea, you can most likely recover without the help of a physician — unless you are in the high-risk category (e.g. pregnant women, very young or very old, immunocompromised), in which case you must seek prompt medical attention.;
, It should resolve itself within a few days time, as your body fights it off just like it would any other mild infection.

, As with all infections, taking it easy and getting plenty of rest gives your body the best chance to recover quickly and without complications. Resting, and staying home from work or school, allows your body to devote all of its energy to healing (and when your immune system works to fight off an infection it takes more energy than you might expect!)

, Fighting off an infection also predisposes you to becoming dehydrated, so drinking plenty of fluids is key. Water and/or electrolyte beverages (such as Gatorade or other sports drinks) are best. Electrolyte beverages can help to increase your hydration because the salt content helps your body to readily absorb more water.

, Consuming vitamin C may also help to boost your immune system when you are sick. Echinacea tablets or teas and zinc may also help as natural ways to boost your immune system; however, neither have been validated in official medical trials.

"
"
Know when to seek medical help.,
Ask for antibiotics.Listeriosis is most often treated with a combination of two antibiotics: Ampicillin and Gentamicin.,
Monitor newborns with extra caution.If Listeria infects a newborn, it can be especially dangerous.",How to Treat Listeria2," As mentioned earlier, listeriosis may spread to your nervous system, leading to a stiff neck, a headache, loss of balance, convulsions, and/or an altered level of consciousness. If you notice any of these signs or symptoms, seek medical help immediately.


Also see a doctor if you have poor overall health, or are elderly, as your immune system may be weaker than the average person and you may need medical support fighting off your infection.
Always see a physician if you are pregnant, or if you suspect that your newborn has listeriosis, as this can be very serious if prompt medical attention is not received.

, Antibiotics are generally not needed in healthy adults with a mild infection, whose immune systems are competent enough to fight off the infection; however, antibiotics are generally offered to:


Elderly patients
Pregnant women (as a means to protect the unborn baby)
Newborns
Individuals with other medical conditions leading to overall weakened immune systems (such as HIV/AIDS, an organ transplant, or other autoimmune conditions)
People in whom the Listeria bacteria has spread to infect their nervous system, which always requires emergency medical care.

, As such, it requires prompt medical treatment and ongoing monitoring, usually in a hospital setting. If your newborn appears ill and has any of the symptoms mentioned above, seek prompt medical attention for diagnosis. Normally, a few different antibiotics will be given to your newborn in order to provide the maximum treatment possible. Your newborn will also be monitored (usually in the hospital setting) where the doctors can keep track of his or her vital signs and overall health. This way, if any complications occur, they can be recognized and handled by experienced medical professionals as soon as possible.


Signs of a possible listeriosis in a newborn include irritability, fever, vomiting, and a decreased interest in feeding."
"
Understand which food products are at heightened risk of containing Listeria.,
Take precautions if you are pregnant.,
Be aware that Listeria can survive freezing.Listeria is a resilient bacteria that is hard to get rid of once it has contaminated food products.",How to Treat Listeria3," It is generally improperly processed deli meats or unpasteurized dairy products that are responsible for carrying Listeria bacteria, but it is also found in soil and on vegetables. Pay attention to any outbreaks of listeriosis that are reported in your area, or to any products that have been recalled from the supermarket due to concern of bacterial contamination. The risk of a serious infection is low for a healthy adult; however, if you fall into a high-risk category (elderly, pregnant, or having an otherwise weakened immune system), you may want to think carefully about eating these types of foods.

, If you are pregnant, it is advisable to avoid soft cheeses (such as blue cheese, brie, feta, camembert, and Mexican-style cheese), as well as deli foods for the duration of your pregnancy, in order to diminish your risk of contracting listeriosis.If you contract listeriosis while pregnant, there is the possibility it can be fatal for your unborn baby.

, Even freezing is not enough to get rid of the bacteria. Listeria is killed by by cooking, so make sure all meats are thoroughly cooked all the way through."

Identify the symptoms of jock itch.,
Wash the groin skin two to three times a day with an antifungal shampoo.,
Keep the area dry.,
Spread an antifungal cream over the area.,
Avoid harsh chemicals on the area.,
Use an aluminum salt solution.,
Use medicated compresses for any blisters.,
Treat athlete’s foot.,
Try holistic options.",How to Treat Jock Itch1," The groin, inner thighs, and buttocks are the most common areas affected by jock itch since the region is prone to dampness which help the responsible bacteria and fungi to spread. While you can treat most cases of jock itch at home, you should still see your doctor for an official diagnosis, as well as testing to determine the cause (whether a fungus or bacteria) since this can alter the treatment method. The symptoms of jock itch usually include:Itching, redness, or scaling of the skin in ring or half-moon shapes
Burning sensations
Pain (usually bacterial infection)
Blistering along the edge of the rash;
, Keeping the area clean will help stop the spread of the fungus or bacteria causing the symptoms. Wash the skin two to three times a day using an antifungal shampoo for the duration of your treatment.You can buy these shampoos without a prescription, and some options include ketoconazole (Nizoral) or selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue).Many of these shampoos are marketed for use against dandruff. However, skin fungus is a common cause of dandruff, and these shampoos do have antifungal formulations., Excess moisture forms a breeding ground for the bacteria and fungi that can cause jock itch. Dry your groin completely after each time you wash the area, and make sure you dry any excess sweat in the area throughout the day as well.Change out of gym clothes immediately and wash them between uses to help prevent jock itch.


Looser-fitting cotton underwear will help reduce excess sweating, and it will also allow sweat to dry faster.Change your towel every day while treating your jock itch, and do not share towels with anyone.
You can use a powder like Gold Bond to keep the area dry.

, Several over-the-counter, antifungal creams are available to help you treat jock itch. Apply after each time you wash and dry the area, and make sure you spread the cream past the edges of the rash.Choose options that include terbinafine, miconazole, or clotrimazole. Brands with these as the active ingredients include Lamisil, Lotrimin, Micatin, and Monistat.Always follow the directions on the packaging for your specific product, and contact your doctor if the symptoms don’t improve after two weeks.
You can also apply a layer of zinc oxide ointment over the other products.This will help protect the skin from additional irritation and wetness.Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands after each application or any other time you come in contact with the region.

, Harsh laundry detergents, bleach, and even fabric softeners in your laundry can lead to additional irritation that can exacerbate your jock itch.Try to avoid these and any other harsh chemicals that can come into contact with your groin for the entire course of your treatment.

, Aluminum salt solutions, such as aluminum chloride 10% soIution or aluminium acetate, are effective antiperspirants because they form plugs on the sweat glands. To use this mixture:


Mix one part aluminum salt with 20 parts water. Apply this solution to the infected area and leave it on for six to eight hours. It is best to apply it at night because that is when your sweat glands are least active. Wash the solution off when you think you will start sweating again. Repeat this process until the lesions become dry and start to fade.

, The fungal ringworm responsible for most cases of jock itch can occasionally cause large area of skin to blister. You can still treat these at home with medicated compresses, such as using a Burow’s Solution. This will dry out the blisters and soothe any discomfort, which will allow you to then resume treatment with the antifungal creams., If your jock itch occurs concurrently with athlete’s foot, then you can easily spread the fungi back to your groin when putting your feet through your underwear to put them on. Make sure to treat both conditions to avoid reinfecting your groin., If you’d prefer to use a home remedy option, then you have a few different options available. You can:Dip gauze or a washcloth in diluted white vinegar (one part vinegar to four parts water). Hold it against the infection twice a day. Once you remove the cloth, pat the skin dry but do not rub it too hard or the infection could scab over.
Pour 1/4 cup of bleach (such as Clorox) into a bathtub full of water and soak in it daily or every other day for minor cases. Ensure that you thoroughly dry the skin when you get out.
Apply a 0.6% ajoene gel. This extract comes from garlic and contains a natural antifungal compound. You can apply it twice daily for up to two weeks."
"
See your doctor if the condition doesn’t improve in two weeks.,
Discuss prescription antifungal creams.,
Ask about oral antifungal medications.,
Discuss topical antibiotic options.,
Inquire about oral antibiotic options.",How to Treat Jock Itch2," If the condition doesn’t improve within two weeks of home treatments, then you either require a prescription-strength antifungal option, or it may be possible that your jock itch is bacterial instead of fungal. Your doctor will also be able to prescribe antibiotics if this is the case.


Your doctor will likely swab the affected area and send the swab to a lab for a culture. This skin culture will help your doctor determine whether the jock itch is indeed fungal or caused by bacteria (commonly staphylococcus)., If your doctor determines that the condition is fungal, but over-the-counter treatments didn’t work for two (or more) weeks, then your doctor will likely recommend a prescription-strength antifungal cream. These options include:Oxiconazole 1% (Oxistat)
Econazole 1% (Spectazole)
Sulconazole 1% (Exelderm)
Ciclopirox 0.77% (Loprox)
Naftifine 2% cream
Note that econazole, sulconazole, ciclopirox, and naftifine cannot be used in children. The side effect of these drugs include burning sensation, skin irritation, stinging, and redness.

, If your case of jock itch has been recurrent or if you are immunosuppressed (such as those with HIV), then your doctor may suggest stronger, oral antifungal drugs. These options may include:Griseofulvin 250 mg twice daily until cure is reached
Terbinafine 250 mg/day for 2-4 weeks
Itraconazole 200 mg/day for 1 week
Fluconazole 150 - 300 mg/week for 2-4 weeks
Ketoconazole 200 mg/day for 4-8 weeks
Note that these medications cannot be used in children or in pregnant women. The common side effects of these drugs include liver damage, dizziness, seizures, nausea, and vomiting. When prescribed, physicians generally monitor the patient's liver functioning periodically.

, If the culture confirms that your condition is actually the result of a bacterial skin infection, then your doctor will discuss antibacterial creams to apply to the area. These options may include:Erythromycin applied twice daily
Clindamycin applied twice daily
Metronidazole applied twice daily
Your doctor may also recommend that you use an antibacterial soap to wash the skin before applying these. OTC antibacterial soaps include Lever 2000 or a chlorhexidine soap such as Hibiclens.

, For more-severe cases of bacterial jock itch, your doctor will prescribe a course of oral antibiotics. Depending on the drug, the prescription could be for anywhere between 5 and 14 days. Some of these antibiotics include:Cephalexin (Keflex)
Dicloxacillin
Doxycycline
Minocycline (Dynacin or Minocin)
Erythromycin

Take NSAIDs.,
Try disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,
Use tumor necrosis factor blockers.,
Get an injection of steroids.",How to Treat Juvenile Arthritis1," Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, are common pain relievers used to treat juvenile arthritis. If the pain from the arthritis is mild, these pain relievers may be the only treatment needed. Many NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter, including ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).NSAIDs can help reduce the severity of pain and swelling.
Your doctor may prescribe stronger NSAIDs if the over-the-counter ones do not help. Younger children may be given liquid doses.
Side effects include gastrointestinal problems like upset stomachs.;
, Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed when NSAIDs don’t work in the treatment of juvenile arthritis. DMARDs slow joint damage and the progression of the arthritis by targeting the immune system. A doctor may prescribe DMARDs along with NSAIDs to help reduce swelling and pain.Examples of DMARDs are methotrexate, leflunamide, infliximab, anakinra, cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, and tocilizumab.
DMARDs may cause negative side effects. You should discuss the side effects with the doctor and monitor the child while they take the medication.

, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers can help if other medications can’t. These medications help relieve pain, reduce swollen joints, and lessen morning stiffness.These drugs can have significant side effects. For example, there may be an increased risk of infections and an increased risk of cancers like lymphoma.
Examples of TNF blockers include etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumbab (Humira).

, In some cases, steroids can be used to treat juvenile arthritis. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth or injected. This can be used if a single joint is affected. This treatment can only be given for a limited amount of time at low doses.Steroids used for long periods of time on children can lead to weight gain, growth problems, bone problems, cataracts, hypertension, and increased risk of infection.

Design a team of specialists.,
Undergo physical therapy.,
Get occupational therapy.,
Consider surgery.",How to Treat Juvenile Arthritis2," Your child should be seen by the proper specialists when being treated for juvenile arthritis. Your child needs to see a pediatric rheumatologist, who specializes in treating all forms of juvenile arthritis. Your child’s pediatrician and a team of nurses will also be involved in their care.Your child’s team will likely also consist of a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist.
Your child’s pediatrician will more than likely diagnose your child. Then they will refer you to a pediatric rheumatologist.

, Your child may need to see a physical therapist as part of their medical treatment plan. A physical therapist or rehabilitation specialist can work with the child to regain use of the joints and improve the range of movement.The physical therapist may design an exercise program appropriate for the child until the symptoms lessen and they can perform most movements.

, Occupational therapy is another important therapy your child may need, depending on the severity of their juvenile arthritis. During occupational therapy, an occupational therapist will teach your child how to adapt to their condition to reduce any strain on the joints. OT is used a lot for arthritis that affects the hands.OT is used to help work with children to improve their reach, grasp, and use of objects. During therapy, the children learn how to dress, bathe, and eat with limbs or joints affected by arthritis.
The occupational therapist may give the child splints or other devices to help ensure the child’s bone and joint growth.

, In very rare cases, your child may need surgery. It is not often a treatment for juvenile arthritis, but if no other medical treatments have alleviated the symptoms, the doctors may consider surgery. The surgery may be used to improve the position of the joint. It might also be used if the joint is deformed."

Join a support group.,
Encourage exercise.,
Try water therapy.,
Get a massage.,
Encourage relaxation techniques.,
Take supplements.",How to Treat Juvenile Arthritis3," Your child may benefit from visiting a support group for those with juvenile arthritis. This can help your child feel like they are not alone because they can meet other child with the same condition. They can also learn from the other children about how to deal with and manage their arthritis.Ask your child’s doctor or search online for a support group in your area.
There are summer camps for children with juvenile arthritis.
The support group may be for children and their families.

, Exercise is important for the management of juvenile arthritis. Exercise and regular physical activity can help improve the function and motion of the joints. It can also reduce the symptoms. When symptoms are under control, children can participate in most sports.Exercise also helps build muscle strength, which helps protect joints. Regular movement also helps build better shock absorption for the joints.Your child can participate in most sports. Swimming is a great activity for arthritis because it doesn’t put pressure on the joints.
Talk to your child’s doctor before letting them participate in sports or exercise.

, Water therapy, also called hydrotherapy, is a common alternative therapy for arthritis. Your child can soak in a warm bath to help loosen stiff joints or relax tight or sore muscles.A warm shower or bath before exercising can help reduce pain or stiffness so the child has an easier time exercising.

, Massage is another good management technique for juvenile arthritis. When a child gets a massage, it helps the muscles to loosen and relax, reduces tightness and stiffness, reduces pain, and helps circulation. Massage also helps with symptoms of anxiety and stress.Parents can give their children massage. The physical therapist can teach you how to give the child a massage.

, Many relaxation techniques can be used to manage the pain and discomfort associated with juvenile arthritis. Your child can learn to use breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. These mind-body techniques cause no negative side effects and can help relieve symptoms.You can talk to your child’s psychologist, counselor, or physical therapist about teaching your child mind-body techniques to manage their condition.

, Your child may benefit from taking supplements or increasing certain vitamins and minerals in their diet. Calcium is important for a child with juvenile arthritis. Calcium helps with bone growth and strength and helps prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D is also needed for using calcium and supporting bone health.If your child is from four to eight, they need 1000 mg of calcium per day, and they need 1300 mg if they are nine to 18 years old.
You can include more vitamin D or calcium into your child’s diet. Dark leafy greens are a good source of calcium, as are seeds and white beans. You can include vitamin D fortified foods in your child’s diet, or encourage them to spend 15 to 20 minutes per day in the sunshine.

Cut triglycerides from your diet.,
Eat less refined sugar.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Eat foods that contain anthocyanins and pectin.,
Try adding turmeric to your diet.",How to Treat Leptin Resistance1," Triglycerides are a type of fat that's associated with leptin resistance, obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other medical issues. In addition to improving your overall health, cutting triglycerides from your diet could improve your leptin sensitivity.Try swapping unhealthy fats in red meat and processed foods for canola and olive oils, plant-based fats, and fatty fish, like salmon or mackerel.;
, A low-sugar diet can help halt weight gain and decrease leptin resistance. Diets high in refined sugar can raise glucose and insulin levels, making your body less sensitive to leptin.Steer clear of sugars and simple carbs found in processed foods, candy, cake, and soft drinks. Instead, go for complex carbs, like whole grains and starches, and naturally occurring sugars found in milk, fruits, and vegetables., Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol could decrease leptin production. If your body produces less leptin, you’ll have more of an appetite. Alcohol’s effects on appetite and metabolism are cumulative, or happen over time, so consider limiting your alcohol consumption in the long-term., Purple sweet potatoes, berries, and other red, blue, and purple foods contain anthocyanins, which can help the brain respond to leptin and curb your appetite.Apples contain pectin, which might improve leptin sensitivity.Jams are also a rich pectin source, but store-bought jams usually contain lots of sugar. Instead, you could try making your own low-sugar, high-pectin preserves.

, Turmeric root contains curcumin, which, among other health benefits, could naturally reverse leptin resistance. Both the ground spice and fresh root contain curcumin.Try sprinkling powdered turmeric in rice, roasted veggies, or sauteed greens. You can also sprinkle a pinch into a smoothie, or cut up a small piece of root and steep it with milk and honey to make a tea.

Try to get an hour of exercise per day.,
Go for longer aerobic workouts.,
Stick with your workouts in the long-term.",How to Treat Leptin Resistance2," The minimum daily exercise recommended for adults is 30 minutes.However, keep in mind that number is a minimum guideline. Try to get at least a solid hour each day, since exercising for less than an hour doesn’t appear to have much of an effect on leptin levels.Talk to your doctor before you start a new exercise regimen or increase your amount of exercise.

, Aerobic exercise can burn fat, reduce body mass, and increase leptin sensitivity.Go for endurance-focused exercises that last at least one hour.

Try running or fast walking, swimming, circuit training, cycling, or spin classes., Stay motivated and stick with your workout plan! Exercising for an hour just one day won’t help your body become more sensitive to leptin. Long-term lifestyle changes, including increased physical activity over time, are required in order to treat leptin resistance.It’s been shown that short-term exercise has no measurable effect on leptin levels.

Talk to your doctor about related health issues.,
Discuss emerging gene and hormone therapies.,
Ask about medications for ER stress.",How to Treat Leptin Resistance3," Leptin resistance can be related to a number of obesity-related medical issues, from heart disease to diabetes. If you haven’t already, schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss your overall health.If you’re concerned about losing weight and improving your health, ask them about medications, dietary changes, and workout routines you should adopt.

, Leptin resistance research is still a relatively young discipline, and new treatments are being studied and developed. In time, gene therapies could become available that help your brain respond to leptin in your system.Hormone treatments have already proved modestly successful at improving leptin sensitivity and aiding weight loss.You could ask your doctor if they’re familiar with or recommend any emerging treatments. Ask them if they could refer you to a medical study on the subject.

, The endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, is a part of a cell that, among other functions, helps with protein transport. ER stress, which can result from neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and obesity, could be related to leptin resistance. Ask your doctor if you might have ER, and if medications that treat ER stress might also improve your leptin sensitivity.Increased exercise can also improve ER stress."

Choose a ferrous iron supplement.,
Take iron on an empty stomach.,
Be aware of the risks and side effects of iron supplements.",How to Treat Iron Deficiency Anemia1," Iron can exist in two ionic forms: ferrous and ferric. Ferrous supplements are better absorbed than ferric.These include ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous citrate. Ferronyl is another form of iron that is better absorbed and commonly used in treatment of iron deficiency anemia. It can be found in supplements as well.Look at the elemental iron content in supplements if listed. You want about 30% elemental iron. The greater the percentage or milligrams listed, the more iron is likely to be absorbed.The dosage is usually 15 to 65 mg of elemental iron per day. This is usually best in divided doses.Make sure your supplement is tested by an independent lab and has a “Seal of Approval” from either Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).
Ferrous is the standard treatment over ferric because it is absorbed better and it has less negative side effects.;
, Most of the adverse effects of an iron supplement can be avoided by taking the iron on an empty stomach, aside from orange juice. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron.You can drink orange juice along with the iron supplement or take a vitamin C supplement.
Do not take iron with milk, calcium supplements, or antacids. This will reduce the absorption of the iron.
Do not take the iron with high fiber foods, coffee, or tea.

, You should know that just because something is natural or required by the body does not mean you can’t overdo it. Iron is a good example. Iron supplements can be dangerous if you take too much. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and keep them away from children.A condition called acquired hemochromatosis can occur because of taking too much iron as a supplement. It can cause joint and abdominal pain, weakness, lowered sex drive, and fatigue.Iron taken as supplements can cause an upset stomach, constipation, or black stools.Talk to your doctor if you are also taking tetracycline, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, or drugs used for Parkinson disease and seizure disorders. Iron can interfere with these medications.
If you have peptic ulcer disease, enteritis, or ulcerative colitis, your should not take iron supplements.

Incorporate enough iron into your diet.,
Eat iron-rich foods.,
Limit iron-decreasing foods.",How to Treat Iron Deficiency Anemia2," You can get your recommended daily amount of iron from food sources. Many believe this is a safer and more effective way of increasing your iron. The amount of iron you need per day depends on your sex and your age. Use the following guide to determine how much iron you need:Infants: Newborns – 6 months: 0.27 mg/day; 7 – 12 months: 11 mg/day.
Children: 1 – 3 years: 7 mg/day; 4–8 years: 10 mg/day.
Men over 9 years old: 8 mg/day.
Women: 9 – 13 years: 8 mg/day; 14 – 18 years: 15 mg/day; 19 – 50 years: 18 mg/day; 51 years and older: 8 mg/day.
Pregnant women should have 27 mg/day. Women who are nursing should get the following: 14 – 18 years old: 10 mg/day; over 18 years old: 9 mg/day.

, A good way to treat iron deficiency anemia is to incorporate more iron into your diet. There are many foods that provide good sources of iron. Iron can be found in almost every food group, and there are plenty of non-meat sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans. Iron rich foods include:Lean red meat, liver, pork, poultry, and fish
Leafy greens like spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, kale, and beet greens, along with broccoli and all different kinds of lettuce
Soy products, such as tofu, soybeans, and soy milk
Legumes, such as peas, white beans, red beans, and chickpeas
Dried fruits, such as raisins, apricots, and prunes
Prune juice
Whole grain cereals and breads that have been iron-fortified

, Certain foods can decrease your body’s iron absorption. If you have iron deficiency anemia, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with your meals because they lower the amount of iron you absorb. You should also not take an iron supplement with your meals.


Don’t drink milk or eat other dairy products for at least an hour after taking iron. The calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption."

See your doctor.,
Treat any underlying causes of anemia.,
Identify the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.,
Learn the causes of iron deficiency anemia.,
Determine if you are at risk.",How to Treat Iron Deficiency Anemia3," To receive the proper treatment, a medical diagnosis has to be determined. There are many forms of anemia, and there can be serious consequences if anemia is left untreated or treated incorrectly. Before you can treat the anemia, you have to understand the cause of it. Make sure you see your physician if you are experiencing any of the symptoms of anemia so that they can determine the underlying cause and proper diagnosis.Your physician will perform a physical exam, listen to your heart and your breathing, and check for physical signs of anemia, such as pale skin and pale mucous tissues.
They will also likely draw a small amount of blood to obtain a Complete Blood Count. This is a test that counts the number of red blood cells and other cells in the blood. The test will also test for the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells. If the underlying cause of the anemia is not clear, other tests may be ordered.

, To treat iron deficiency anemia, you may need to treat the underlying condition that led to the anemia. The treatment depends on your specific condition.For iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss during menstruation, hormone treatments may be considered to lighten the flow.
For anemia due to bleeding in the digestive tract, antibiotics and antacids or acid-reducing medications may be prescribed.
In the case of lead poisoning, chelation therapy is used. In chelation therapy, certain drugs are used to bind to and filter out the lead.Rarely, blood transfusions may be necessary in severe cases of iron deficiency anemia.
If the anemia is due to internal bleeding, surgery may be required to stop the bleeding.
Other possible reasons for iron deficiency include decreased iron absorption, Celiac disease, certain foods and medications, poor response to erythropoietin, or gastric bypass surgery.

, There are many different type of anemia, and anemia sometimes has generic symptoms that might be due to other conditions. This is why a doctor’s diagnosis is important. The symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include:Constant fatigue not relieved by rest or sleep
Pale skin
Dizziness
A rapid or an irregular heartbeat
Cold hands and feet
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Cognitive problems, such as confusion or memory loss
Headache

, Red blood cells contain a protein known as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells picks up oxygen in the lungs and dumps out the carbon dioxide at the same time. Hemoglobin contains iron, and without the iron, hemoglobin can’t function properly. Also without sufficient iron, your bone marrow cannot make enough red blood cells, and the result is anemia. You can get iron deficiency anemia if you:Don’t consume enough iron in your foods. This can be due to poor nutrition and pregnancy.
Can’t absorb the iron from your foods. This can happen with certain disorders, such as celiac disease, or if part of your intestines have been removed by surgery.
Lose too much iron by some form of internal bleeding, such as bleeding in the intestine, heavy menstrual bleeding, or because of the use of certain medications like aspirin or NSAIDs that can cause internal bleeding.
Have lead poisoning. The lead replaces the iron in hemoglobin, and the hemoglobin cannot carry oxygen properly.
Take aspirin regularly, which can cause ulcers and lead to bleeding.

, There are a number of risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. Knowing if you are at risk can help you monitor for any symptoms or increase the amount of iron-rich foods in your diet. The most common risk factors include:Gender. Women who menstruate are at greater risk because they lose iron during their periods. Those with heavy periods are at a higher risk.
Age. Children and infants need more iron for proper growth and development.
Intestinal conditions that prevent the absorption of nutrients. Examples of these types of intestinal disorders are celiac disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Irritable Bowel Diseases (IBD), and Leaky Gut Syndrome.Pregnancy. Being pregnant can deplete a woman’s store of iron because it is being used to help produce blood in the fetus.
Nutrition. Many people don’t eat well and do not get enough iron in their foods. Vegetarians and vegans can be at risk for iron-deficiency as well, but only if they don’t include iron-rich foods in their diets.

Understand phlebotomy treatment.,
Know that after the extra iron has been removed, your doctor will set up a long-term maintenance program to make sure you keep a normal amount of iron in your body.,
Be aware that regular phlebotomy treatment keeps the amount of iron in your body at a normal level.",How to Treat Iron Overload and Hemochromatosis," The treatment consists of two phases: an iron reduction phase and a long-term maintenance phase.


Iron Reduction Phase:
A phlebotomist or health care professional will remove close to one pint of whole blood. This is usually done once or twice a week.
The treatment lasts until the extra iron in your body has been removed. This can take three months to one year - time varies from person to person.
During this phase your doctor will also check your hemoglobin (a protein that is a found in red blood cells) and serum ferritin levels.

;
, How often one needs phlebotomy is based on the severity of the symptoms.

, Treatments differ for men and women and the elderly.


Men most often need to have 3–4 US pints (1,000–2,000 ml) of blood taken out about once every 3 months.
Women may require 1–2 US pints (470–950 ml) of blood be taken out once every 6 months.
Older people may not need to have any more treatments, but they should still have their serum ferritin levels checked at least once a year.

Avoid moving your wrist as soon as the injury occurs.,
Assess the symptoms you have.,
Find a splint that you can use to keep your wrist immobile.,
Place your arm on the splint.,
Wrap the splint and your wrist.,
Ice your wrist.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication.,
Hold your wrist still on the way to the hospital.",How to Treat a Colles Fracture1," If you have fallen or something else has happened where you think your wrist has fractured, it is important to keep it from moving around too much. You don’t necessarily have to go see the doctor that day if the pain is not too severe and the wrist doesn’t look deformed; however, you should go to the doctor by the next day.In the meantime, make sure not to use your wrist or move it more than you have to.


If the pain is severe or the wrist looks deformed (the bone is sticking out or you think it might have fractured in more than one place) you should go to the hospital immediately.
Do not eat or drink anything (even water) if your wrist is malformed and likely to need to be put back into place (closed reduction). In that case, anesthesia will need to be administered and you might experience nausea that would cause you to vomit during or right after the reduction.;
, Symptoms include: pain at the wrist, bruising at the wrist, swelling at the wrist, deformity of the hand or wrist, and numbness or tingling of the fingers. There is also a potential for paleness of the extremity or fingers, but this is usually due to complications.


If there is paleness or lack of mobility of the fingers, the fracture will require a visit to the doctor.
Those with Colles fractures also usually have a history of a fall, usually in which they used an outstretched hand to brace themselves for the fall. This may include high impact trauma in a younger patient or lower impact trauma in an older osteoporotic adult.

, You should look for something that can keep your wrist from moving. The splint should be as long as your forearm, wrist and hand. If you don’t have a proper medical splint at your house (or wherever you are when the injury occurs) you can use other objects that are wide, flat, and the right length.For example, if a ruler runs the length of your hand, wrist, and most of your forearm, use a ruler as a splint.
A folded length of newspaper that runs past your elbow and to the middle joints of your fingers works as well. The general rule for splinting is that the joint above the fracture (ie: the elbow) and all the joints below (fingers and thumb) need to be immobilized to protect the fracture. Bear this in mind when splinting.

, Do not try to straighten your wrist out when you place it on the splint; you should leave it at the angle it is bent at after your injury. If you try to straighten it out, you could actually make the fracture worse. Instead, rest your wrist and arm on the splint.Pad the hollow areas between your arm, wrist, fingers etc and the splint to make sure the fracture is supported and not deformed by the wrapping.

, Wrap your lower arm and wrist in gauze or an Ace bandage. You should wrap it tight enough that it won’t move but not so tightly that it cuts off circulation to your hand.If you don’t have gauze or an Ace bandage on hand, you can use a scarf or bandanna to keep your wrist in place against the splint.
Work from above the break down. Check the circulation in your fingertips after wrapping by pressing on the fingernail. If the color does not return promptly, loosen the bandage and re-wrap.

, Use an ice pack or bag of ice to ice your wrist. Place the ice pack on top of your wrist, making sure that the ice covers the area where the fracture occurred. The ice will help to bring the swelling down and will keep further swelling from happening.


Don’t place ice directly on the skin. You should already have your wrist wrapped, so this shouldn’t be an issue.
You can leave the ice pack on your wrist for up to 10 minutes, then give your skin a chance to return to its normal temperature.

, You can take acetaminophen to help you deal with the pain caused by your fractured wrist. You may also consider taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen together to combat the pain and swelling at the same time.Do not do this, however, if your wrist is malformed and likely to need to be put back into place (closed reduction). In that case, anesthesia will need to be administered and having pain medication in your system can interfere with that. If you choose to take pain medication anyway, be sure to inform your doctor.

, When you head to the hospital, you should hug your arm to your chest to keep it from moving around while you are in the car. If you have a sling, put your arm into it so that you don’t have to worry about your wrist moving around too much.You can also make a sling out of a scarf or other piece of clothing.

Have x-rays taken of your wrist.,
Have the severity of the fracture assessed.,
Get a cast applied to a hairline fracture.,
Undergo a closed reduction and a cast applied to a fracture.,
Ask about surgical treatment.",How to Treat a Colles Fracture2," When you get to the hospital, your doctor will take x-rays of your wrist to determine how badly your wrist has been fractured. This is the best way to see the damage to the bone and to figure out the best course of treatment.

, Fractures are described in terms displacement of fragments and involvement of the joint. Displacement of fragments means how many of the bone pieces are out of place. Displacement can be minimal or great, and is judged on a spectrum. The other prominent feature in gauging the severity of fractures is whether the fracture involves a joint, or is “articular,"" in contrast to an extra-articular fracture, in which the joint is not involved. Breaks involving joints are inherently more severe because healing them is more complicated.


There are several classifications of Colles fractures, depending on the severity of the injury. Colles fractures are referred to as: Type I: extra articular and non-displaced, Type II: extra articular and displaced, Type III: intra articular and non-displaced, and Type IV: Intra articular and displaced.The criteria that define a break as a Colles fracture include: transverse fracture of the radius, the fracture occurs within 2.5 cm proximal to the radio-carpal or wrist joint, and dorsal or posterior displacement and dorsal angulation with a radial tilt. , This type of small fracture does not require realignment of the bone. Instead, your bone just needs to be held in place in order to heal properly.

, If your wrist is fractured so that the ends of the bone overlap or are slightly at an angle, your doctor will most likely perform a closed reduction. For this treatment, the wrist is manipulated and positioned so that the bones are in the correct position. Then a cast is applied to keep the wrist in this proper position. The majority of Colles fractures may be treated non-surgically with a cast for a period of 6 weeks.You will be given anesthesia if you have to have the bones in your wrist repositioned. However, keep in mind that this procedure doesn’t require surgery. Your doctor is essentially just popping your wrist back into place.
You might have to wear a splint for a couple of days to deal with the swelling in your wrist before getting a proper cast.
There are some newer casting technologies which allow for the structural integrity and durability of a cast, while still allowing for a degree of airiness and the and ability to bathe normally. Closed reduction would be appropriate for Types I, II fractures certainly, and may be appropriate for Type III fractures. ( Diaz-Garcia, 2012).
In recent studies, there are few differences in comparison of non-operative and operative management of Colles fractures.In elderly patients with distal radius fractures, those who received treatment with closed reduction (moving the bone back into place manually) with casting alone had equal functional status scores and significantly decreased pain scores.
In patients who reported excellent functional status, 77% had a notable visual deformity the “dinner fork deformity” often seen in this fracture. This deformity did not correspond with poor functional outcome, or patient dissatisfaction. Persistent pain was correlated with patient dissatisfaction and surgical treatment.

, If the fracture is determined to be unstable, then you may need surgical treatment, which is also called an open reduction. You would have to have this surgery done if: the fracture involves the wrist joints, the fractured bone breaks through the skin, the bone is fractured or broken in many places, or the injury also involves torn ligaments. Basically, if you have really done a number on your wrist and it is severely fractured, you may be referred to an orthopedic surgeon so that you can have your wrist corrected surgically.


This will occur if a closed reduction does not result in satisfactory use of the wrist, there is a “shortening” of the radius of greater than 5 mm, or it is a comminuted fracture with greater than 3 fracture fragments of the radius.
With surgery, the fracture is placed back together with tiny plates and screws to achieve an anatomically superior result. The extremity will still be placed in a splint or cast and monitored sequentially during the 6 week healing period. This approach would be typically considered more favorable in younger patients. A superior radiographic outcome is not always correlated with a superior functional outcome, but it is always the goal, set out upon when repairing these fractures.
During the operation, you will be asleep (under general anesthesia) and your bones will be straightened, placed correctly and held together with pins, plates and/or screws specifically designed for use in bone. After surgery your wrist will be placed in a splint or cast to prevent it from moving.Complications are not dependent on treatment method selected, but due to the trauma sustained. Specific complications include: the presence of a cosmetic “dinner fork” deformity, median nerve palsy or weakness also called post traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome, or Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy  (RSD) or Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome. This occurs as a result of injury to the median nerve from compression due to swelling, or lack of blood flow, secondary to a compartment like syndrome."

Wear your cast for the required time.,
Elevate and rest your wrist.,
Do not get your cast wet.,
Avoid doing things that could harm your wrist.,
Try your hardest to avoid sticking things in your cast to scratch an itch.,
Watch for signs of infection if you have had surgery.,
Check in with your doctor.,
See a physical therapist after the cast has been removed.",How to Treat a Colles Fracture3," Most patients have to wear a cast for 4 to 6 weeks depending on the extent of your injury and how fast you heal. While you have the cast on, your doctor will provide you with instructions to promote healing and will provide you with a sling. The basic instructions are also listed in this section.

, Keep your wrist elevated and make sure to rest it for at least a week after you get the cast. Keeping your wrist elevated means making sure that it is kept up above your heart. Resting your wrist means avoiding strenuous exercises or activities in which you use your wrist.You can do this by sitting in a chair and propping your wrist up with pillows. Reclining chairs work the best, but any chair or sofa will do.

, Water will damage the cast and can get in between your cast and arm, promoting conditions that can lead to an infection, especially if you had surgery and have an incision. If you take a shower or bath, place a plastic bag securely over the cast and tape the ends of the bag so that no water can get into the cast. Ideally you should avoid having water fall on the cast during bathing.


Some doctors advise placing a towel over the plastic bag as an extra precaution.
You may want to ask a family member or friend to help you bathe or shower.

, You should try to keep your wrist from moving as much as possible. This means that you should avoid the activities that involve the use of your wrist. You should also avoid situations where someone could bump into your injured wrist.


As an added protection, always wear your sling when you go out in public because it will keep it from moving when you walk and will alert others to the fact that you have an injury and they should make an effort not to bump into you.

, After a couple of days, your cast-covered arm might become itchy. The itching is usually from hair growth under the cast, minor irritation that the cast causes your skin, or from dead skin cells that are normally shed but can’t because there is a cast trapping them.

, The orthopedist will follow the area where the pins are placed carefully for signs of infection. Signs of infection include redness or swelling at pin/wire sites, drainage from the insertion site, fever, and warmth of the skin in the area.

, Your doctor will most likely ask you to come in throughout your recovery time. He or she may take x-rays to make sure that your wrist is healing properly. If it is, your doctor will most likely give you a smaller cast (meaning that he or she will cut off the ends of your cast) making it easier for your to bathe and scratch those itches you’ve been dreaming of relieving.

, Once you are free of your cast, you will be asked to go see a physical therapist who will help you perform exercises to regain the strength in your wrist and surrounding muscles, and to regain normal function of your wrist. Physical therapy usually lasts a month, with three to four sessions each week.The therapist will also give you exercises that you can perform at home on your own. The more you practice the exercises as directed by your therapist, the faster you will regain function of your wrist.

Assess the severity of the bite.,
Wash a minor bite.,
Disinfect the wound to prevent bacteria or other pathogens from growing.,
Prevent infection in a minor bite by applying an over-the-counter antibiotic cream.,
Protect the wound with a band aid.,
Go to the doctor if your bite is too serious for you to care for it adequately.,
Discuss your treatment options with your doctor.,
Take antibiotics if your doctor prescribes them.,
Determine the cat’s immunization status.,
Get vaccinated if necessary.,
Monitor the wound for signs of infection.,
Learn how to recognize when cats are feeling threatened.,
Be gentle to cats.,
Avoid interacting with stray cats.",How to Treat a Cat Bite," Sometimes cats just give warning nips without breaking the skin, other times the bites can result in deep punctures from their fangs.Inspect the bite and look for areas where the skin may have been broken.
A child may be crying and scared, even if the bite did not break the skin.;
, If the cat’s teeth did not break the skin or broke the skin but did not go deep, you can wash and clean the bite at home.Thoroughly wash the bite with soap and clean tap water, allowing the water to flow over the bite and remove dirt and bacteria from the wound. Hold the bite under running water for several minutes.
Gently squeeze the bite to help the blood flow. This will help remove dirt and bacteria from the inside of the wound.

, Put the disinfectant on a sterile cotton ball and then gently wipe it over the bite. It will probably sting, but only briefly. The following chemicals have excellent germicidal properties:Rubbing alcohol
Iodine scrub
Hydrogen peroxide

, Smear a pea-sized amount of topical antibiotic cream over all areas where the skin was broken.Triple antibiotic creams are widely available and effective. Always read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Talk to a doctor before using these medications on infants or if you are pregnant.

, This will help keep dirt and bacteria out as it heals. Cover all areas where the skin was broken with a clean band aid.


Because cat bites usually cover a small area, you will probably be able to cover it with an over-the-counter adhesive Band Aid.
Dry the bite first, to help the Band Aid stick.

, This includes bites that:Are on the face
Have deep puncture wounds from the cat’s fangs
Bleed a lot and won’t stop
Have damaged tissue that needs to be removed
Are on joints, ligaments, or tendons

, Depending upon your particular bite and health condition, your doctor may:Close wounds to stop bleeding
Remove dead tissue to prevent infection
Do X-rays to assess damage to joints
Recommend reconstructive surgery if you have severe damage or risk of scars

, This can help reduce your chances of getting an infection. They are frequently prescribed for severe cat bites, particularly for people who are have weakened immune systems from conditions like diabetes or HIV or are undergoing chemotherapy. Your doctor may prescribe:Cefalexin
Doxycycline
Co-Amoxiclav
Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride
Metronidazole

, Unvaccinated cats may be infected with diseases that can be transmitted through bites and are dangerous for people. If the cat is a pet, consult the owner about whether the cat is up-to-date on its shots. If the cat is yours, check your records to see when it was last vaccinated.
Go to the doctor immediately if the cat is wild, feral, or you can’t confirm that it was up-to-date on its shots. Even if the cat looked healthy, you should still go to the doctor if you can confirm that the cat had its shots. The cat could still have been carrying a disease, but just not have been symptomatic.

, People who have been bitten by cats are at risk for several diseases. Your doctor may recommend you be vaccinated for:Rabies. While some animals with rabies may be clearly ill, including the classic symptom of foaming at the mouth, the disease can be transmitted before the symptoms become obvious. If there is a chance you were infected with rabies, the doctor will vaccinate you against the infection.Tetanus. Tetanus is caused by a bacteria that is in dirt and animal feces. This means that if your wound looks dirty or deep, and you haven’t had a tetanus shot within the last five years, your doctor may give you one to be sure that you won’t get infected., Go to the doctor immediately if you have any of the following signs of infection: Redness
Swelling
Increasing pain over time
Pus or fluid coming from the wound
Swollen lymph nodes
Fever
Chills and shivering

, Most cat bites occur when cats feel that they have to defend themselves. If you have pet cats, teach your children to understand your cats' body language. A cat that is scared may:


Hiss
Growl
Lay his ears flat against his head
Become pilo erect, in which the fur stands up, making the cat look bigger than usual

, Frequent situations in which a cat may become aggressive include:


When she is cornered
If her tail is pulled
If she is held when she is struggling to get away
If she is startled or hurt
During rough play. Instead of allowing your cat to wrestle with your hands or feet, drag a string and let the cat chase that instead.

, Strays often live in cities or towns, but they may not be used to close contact with humans. Don’t try to pet them or pick them up.


Don't feed stray or feral cats in areas where they will come into contact with children.
Cats that are not used to people may react unpredictably.

Look into ginseng and menthol extract (Ren shen bai du wan).,
Try blue dragon extract (Xiao Qing Long Tang Wan).,
Use additional herbs to alleviate symptoms.",How to Treat a Cold with Traditional Chinese Medicine1," According to traditional Chinese medicine, the common cold can fall under several designations, but the most common type experienced is the wind cold. The goal of treatment for wind cold is to shorten the duration of the disease and to provide immediate relief from the symptoms.


Some signs of a cold caused by wind cold are: cold intolerance, mild fever, absence of sweat, chest tightness or congestion, and runny nose with clear mucus.;
, Ginger tea is thought to help expel the ‘evil’, or pathogens that cause cold. The ginger is also said to promote a healthy appetite which is needed for speedy recovery.

This extract contains Japanese honeysuckle, burdock, forsythia, isatis, and lophantherum.
These ingredients are thought to expel heat and clear toxins.

, Ginseng and menthol extract is used to expel or eradicate pathogens coming from the wind. This can also help alleviate the stress of cold and damp conditions due to the imbalance of qi.

, Blue dragon extract is used to repel harmful fluid from an external cold. It is used to treat fever and the chills through sweating, which can help expel diffused phlegm. The use of this concoction can expel or eradicate exogenous pathogen patterns by allowing the body to release cold through sweating.

, Treatment of this type is centered on the release of the pathogen through sweating, so other sweat-inducing herbs can be beneficial. Chinese medicine experts recommend cinnamon decoction, and cnidium and tea formula, as well as the minor blue dragon decoction to treat colds caused by wind cold.


It can also help to consume foods rich in onion, garlic, ginger and coriander, all of which can better expel the pathogen causing your cold.

Determine if your cold is caused by wind heat.,
Drink chrysanthemum and peppermint tea.,
Take Ganmao Qing.,
Try Yin Chiao Chieh Tu Pien (Yin Qiao Jie Du).,
Try isatis root granule (Ban lan gen).",How to Treat a Cold with Traditional Chinese Medicine2," Although most colds are cause by wind cold, sometimes wind heat proves to be the culprit. In this case, the treatment aims to help the body return to its balanced state, which means that heat inside the body should be expelled. Treatment options include the use of cold and flu formula, wind heat clearing, and lung heat clearing.


Some signs of a cold caused by wind heat are: speedy pulse (above 60 beats per minute), headache, dry, non-productive cough expectorating yellow mucus, irritability, sore and swollen throat, and fever.

, Prepare a chrysanthemum and peppermint tea to relieve headache, fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. This tea works to cool down the body and expel the wind heat.


Boil 6 grams of chrysanthemum in a pot of 400 ml of boiling water.

Get acupuncture.,
Massage yourself.,
Try involving a Qi Gong master.,
Investigate other remedies with the help of a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.",How to Treat a Cold with Traditional Chinese Medicine3," Acupuncture is another means of treating the common cold using traditional Chinese medicine. In this method of healing, certain points are stimulated with needles in order to encourage blood flow to the head, neck, chest, and shoulder areas. Acupuncture works by releasing endorphins and natural steroids like cortisol, to manage the pain and discomfort caused by the common cold.

, If you cannot get acupuncture treatment from a specialist, there are some massage techniques you can apply to yourself at home. These techniques trigger some of the same pressure points as acupuncture, albeit less effectively. At home you can do the following:


Rub your forehead from the middle to the sides (10 times).
Knead the area on the side of your eyes (10 times).
Rub your temples (10 times).
Knead your nape or the back of your head (10 times).
Grasp the back of your neck (10 times).
Rub your shoulders (10 times).
The area between your thumb and index finger should be nipped and kneaded (10 times).

Use diet to help treat colds.,
Avoid negative emotions to heal.,
Exercise to increase health.",How to Treat a Cold with Traditional Chinese Medicine4," Dietary treatment for colds should first start with determining whether the cold is caused by wind heat or wind cold. To determine the source of your cold, eat ginger.


If you experience excessive thirst, dry mouth, sore throat, and sweating after eating, then your cold is caused by wind heat.

To alleviate this type of cold, eat foods that have cooling properties such as cucumber and watermelon.


In case you are experiencing cold intolerance, the only way to counter that is by eating warm foods like garlic and curry.
Do not overeat. Chinese traditional medicine maintains that proper diet can restore balance to the body and boost your immune system.

, Your emotions play a key role in your overall health. Traditional Chinese medicine indicates that there are seven types of emotions that must be monitored and reduced, because they are factors that can aggravate an illness. These emotions include: anxiety, anger, fear, fright, overjoy, overthinking, and sadness.


Do a self-check every time you feel a surge of these emotions, because they can harm several organs in the body.
You can regulate your emotions by thinking positive, being optimistic, meditating, and listening to calming and soothing music.

, The type of exercise beneficial to reducing colds is mostly centered on doing slow, rhythmic exercises that require you to be mindful of your breathing. Exercise should focus on incorporating all the parts of the body.


A good exercise found in Chinese culture for this type of workout is tai-chi.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat bland food.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Treat Hand Foot and Mouth2," It is important to stay hydrated while you are dealing with hand, foot, and mouth disease, especially if you have a fever. Drink eight 8 ounce glasses of water per day and drink more if you still feel thirsty.


Cool water is best because it will hydrate you and help numb the sores a bit. You may also want to include some popsicles and a bowl of ice cream each day.Call your doctor if you are having trouble drinking or holding down fluids. If you are treating a child with hand, foot, and mouth, make sure that your child is drinking plenty of fluids.

, Any foods that are spicy, salty, or acidic may irritate your sores and cause the pain to feel worse, so it is best to avoid these foods until you recover.For example, you could eat some oatmeal and applesauce, warm chicken broth with some plain brown rice, or a smoothie made with milk, a frozen banana, and a spoonful of peanut butter.


Try rinsing out your mouth with a bit of warm water after you eat to get rid of any food residue that may irritate the sores.
Call your doctor if the sores make it too painful to eat.

Wash your hands often.,
Stay home from school or work.,
Avoid touching or kissing people.,
Clean soiled surfaces right away.,
Keep children home from school and/or daycare.",How to Treat Hand Foot and Mouth3," Hand, foot, and mouth disease is contagious, so it is important to wash your hands often. Make sure that everyone in your household knows to do the same. Frequent hand washing can help to prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease., You may need to take some time off from work or school if you have hand, foot, and mouth disease. When you have hand, foot, and mouth, disease you are contagious and being around others puts them at risk of catching the disease as well., Although it may be hard to avoid all physical contact with people for the duration of your illness, it is important to avoid kissing people or touching them with your hands while you are ill. By kissing and touching someone, you will put them at risk of contracting this disease.Do not share utensils, lip products, water bottles, or any other items that have come into contact with your mouth.If you do touch someone's cocksackie rash, then wash your hands right away.

, To prevent members of your household from becoming infected by touching soiled surfaces, clean any surfaces that become soiled.For example, if one of your sores leaks a bit of fluid as you are turning a doorknob, use a disinfectant spray and a paper towel to clean the doorknob right away.

, Children and infants with the disease should not go to school while they are contagious. This means that if your child or infant has hand, foot, and mouth disease, then you will need to keep him or her home from school and/or daycare until the symptoms clear up, probably for about three to five days. However, it may take up to 10 days for signs of the disease to clear up."

Push yourself, but don’t go too far.,
Be aware of the signs you are pushing too hard with endurance and aerobic exercises.,
Understand the different types of heart rhythm disorders.,
Determine the difference between types of tachycardia.,
Understand how conduction disorders are connected to arrhythmia.",How to Treat Heart Rhythm Disorders with Exercise," The first thing to do is to see your physician to determine the type of arrhythmia you are experiencing. For many types of arrhythmias, exercise is part of the treatment but you need to consult with your physician to determine which exercise are the most suited to your condition.For most arrhythmias, exercise is encouraged and can often be an integral part of treatment.;
, To determine the exact type of arrhythmia you have and the exact form of exercise that could be recommended, your physician is likely to have you wear a 24-hour cardiac monitor (a Holter monitor). This is usually worn for several days to assess the heart rhythm.Exercise is always an important part of health, but there are some forms of exercise that are discouraged for some forms of arrhythmia. This will help your doctor assess what is best for your exact situation.

, Your doctor may also order a cardiac stress test, such as a treadmill stress test that may be done with an attached imaging device. This will help determine if you may have an arrhythmia that is induced by exercise or made worse with exercise or if you have associated blockages in your heart arteries.This type of test can also give you a heart rate (HR) goal and to let you know when enough is enough!

, Emerging research indicates that improving your cardiorespiratory fitness and losing weight if you are obese can reduce the likelihood of the return of an irregular heartbeat.Being moderately physically active may reduce the burden on your heart and help you maintain a regular heart rhythm., Your doctor may also recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program which is (usually) a monitored set of exercises over a number of weeks on a treadmill. During a cardiac rehabilitation program, your heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored with an EKG on occasion.If your arrhythmia is serious, this may be the safest way to incorporate exercise into your recovery.

, There are four basic types of exercise categories: endurance or aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility. Endurance is the “toughest” form and should be worked up to. Strength, balance, and flexibility exercises are the best to begin with. In other words, don’t try and run a marathon the first week!


Treating heart rhythm disorders with exercise requires that you individualize your exercise regimen, whatever type of exercise you choose to do, so that it fits your specific ability and needs. You can practice these exercise categories in many different ways, on your own and in groups.
Endurance exercises can include activities such as running, jogging, riding your bicycle, using a rowing machine, yard work, and dancing.
Strength exercises usually include lifting weights in a variety of ways.
Balance exercises include a variety of yoga and tai chi poses, for example.
Flexibility exercises include stretching in a variety of ways, including with yoga or static stretches.

, Work up to your workout goals. For example, if the overall goal for endurance and aerobic exercises should be 30–45 minutes five days a week (or at least 150 minutes a week), don't start with that much time. Start with five to 10 minutes five days a week unless otherwise recommended for you.Work your way up gradually, but don’t omit stretching, flexibility, and balance exercises even when you are doing short workouts.
You can also incorporate daily activities such as walking or climbing stairs and use these to start building up endurance. Also, many activities can build both strength and endurance or both balance and strength. For example, yoga can help with your strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.At first, it is recommended that you work with a professional exercise specialist, along with your physician, to ensure that your exercise program is both the right one for you and that you understand how to do the exercises correctly.

, Recent research shows that high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, improves cardiovascular health and can lower rates of common rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation.This type of training, which has the person switching between intervals of moderate-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise (like walking and running), may, in fact, be better than endurance exercises for those with heart rhythm disorders.An example of HIIT would be a brisk, five-minute warm up, followed by 60 seconds of walking or jogging. Then switch to running or sprinting for 30 seconds, then go back to walking for another 60 seconds, and so on. After 20 minutes of switching between medium- and high-intensity exercise, cool down for five minutes.
Talk to your doctor about HIIT and what would be appropriate for you (you may need to start with longer intervals of medium-intensity exercise and shorter periods of high-intensity exercise, for instance).

, Strength exercises strengthen your muscles and improve the tone of the muscles. This can involve using resistance bands or lifting weights. Again, you want to start small and work your way into either bands with greater resistance or heavier weights.You don’t have to “bulk up” necessarily, unless you want to. Start with 1–2-pound weights and raise your arms over your head or in front of you, repeating each five to eight times. You can also do arm curls, bending your elbows to bring the weights to shoulder level. You can do the same upper body exercises with resistance bands.
For your lower body, hang on to a chair or counter, and place either weights on your ankles or use a resistance band and lift your legs to the side, the front, and the back.

, Flexibility exercises stretch, strengthen, and tone your muscles and keep you limber with greater freedom of movement. Stretching also can help decrease joint pain and decrease inflammation. Stretching exercises can be as simple as stretching your arms and legs before strength or endurance exercises or more intense and formal as doing Yoga.Stretching exercises can be done on a chair, on the floor, or both.
You should always stretch before any exercise activity.

, Balance exercises are particularly important in older individuals in preventing falls. These can be lower body exercises to strengthen your legs, practicing standing on one foot, or practicing Tai Chi. A very easy balance exercise is the Heel-to-Toe walk where you place the heel of one foot at the toe of your lead foot and then the heel of that foot at the toe of the other foot.Practice walking across the room. If you need to, walk along a countertop to hang on to.

, It is fine to push yourself, but gently, towards your fitness goals. However, be careful not to push too hard. Arrhythmias can also be induced by exercise.That is why it is very important to work with your physician, to take the recommended medications, and to be aware of any signs of a problem.


If you see any of those signs, stop and let your physician know.
Exercise and physical activity is great for your overall heart health and will benefit you, but you do need to understand warning signs and work with your healthcare professionals for the best outcome.

, Endurance and aerobic exercises should absolutely be first started with guidance from an exercise professional and you should have clear guidance from your cardiologist about your target HR and the signs that indicate you are pushing too far. Some of these signs could include:Heart rate over your target HR
Palpitations or any sense of an irregular HR (an arrhythmia)
Dizziness
Lightheadedness
Blurry vision or difficulty focusing on an object
Chest pain
Loss of consciousness
Inability to catch your breath
If you experience any of these, stop immediately and tell someone or call 911 (or emergency services)

, Heart rhythm disorders, also known as heart arrhythmias, basically involve abnormal heart rhythms. There are a number of different types of heart arrhythmias:Atrial fibrillations (AFib): The upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, contract with an irregular rhythm. The symptoms of AFib are fatigue, a rapid heartbeat, a feeling of fluttering or thumping in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise. The irregular heart rate can lead to stagnant blood flow in the heart, which can cause clots. These clots can travel to other organs and can lead to stroke, blood clots, heart failure and other heart complications.
Ventricular fibrillation (VFib): The lower pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, contract with an irregular rhythm. VFib is the most dangerous form of arrhythmia because in VFib, the heart cannot pump blood, as the rhythm causes the heart not to pump. The symptoms are often sudden and involve a loss of responsiveness with no breathing. Immediate medical attention is essential.
Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a slow heart rate (lower than 60 beats per minute (bpm). Physically fit adults often have a heart rate of less than 60bpm because of their physical fitness. This is a physiologic bradycardia. Symptoms of a dangerous (pathologic) bradycardia include fatigue, dizziness, fainting. Pathologic bradycardia can result in heart failure, chest pain and high blood pressure.
Premature contractions are an early heartbeat that is often described as skipping a beat and are very common. They usually do not require treatment.
Tachycardia: Tachycardia is a rapid heart rate (higher than 100 bpm). There are three forms of tachycardia.

, The three types include supraventricular, sinus, and ventricular. Each type is a bit different from the others.With supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) the rapid heart rate begins in the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. SVT can be paroxysmal, meaning that it can come on suddenly. SVT is the most common form of arrhythmia in children. In adults, SVT is more common in women. The main symptoms is the rapid heart beat.
Sinus tachycardia is an increase in heart rate that may be a normal response to fever, fear, anxiety or exercise. It may also be a response to anemia, thyroid disorders, heart disease or a hemorrhage.
Ventricular tachycardia can be life threatening and requires immediate treatment. Symptoms include dizziness, fainting and a heart attack.

, Conduction disorders are heart rate abnormalities which are caused because of delay in the electrical impulse of the heart. Conduction disorders aren’t always associated with arrhythmias and arrhythmias aren’t always associated with conduction disorders, but they can be related. Conduction disorders interfere with the electrical signal that sets your heart rate and can include:Bundle Branch Blocks are a conduction disorder of the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. Often no treatment is needed.
Heart blocks are those that block the electrical signal from the atria (the upper chambers) to the ventricles (the lower chambers), Heart blocks most often do require treatment.
Long Q-T Syndrome is relatively rare and is a hereditary disorder.
Adams-Stokes disease is a sudden interruption of a normal heartbeat.
Atrial flutter can occur along with AFib or can occur on its own and leads to a very rapid, steady heartbeat
Sick Sinus Syndrome occurs when the sinus node, where the heart’s electrical signal begins, doesn’t “fire” properly.
Sinus arrhythmia are changes in the heart rate during breathing and is quite common in children and somewhat less common in adults.
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome occurs in people with an extra electrical “circuit” causing the signal to arrive at the ventricles too soon, with the signal ricocheting back into the atria.

, Even if you suffer from gluten intolerance and have to remove many foods from your diet, you can restock your kitchen and enjoy alternative foods or gluten-free products. Not having foods or products containing gluten can help ensure that you don’t accidentally prepare something that will exacerbate your symptoms.If you live in a home with others who still eat gluten, consider keeping your food separate to be entirely sure that you don’t cross contaminate what you will eat.
You can eat the following naturally gluten-free foods without much concern: beans, seeds, nuts, fresh eggs, fresh meats, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables, most dairy products.Most grocery stores and other large retailers now offer a wide variety of gluten-free foods that you may have otherwise had to cut out. Ask if there is an aisle of designated “gluten-free” products with which you can stock your kitchen.

, Many naturally gluten-free foods contain hidden amounts of gluten or are processed with glutinous foods. Reading food labels can help you avoid these foods and unpleasant symptoms.Some naturally gluten-free grains that you can include in your diet are: amaranth, arrowroot, buckwheat, corn and cornmeal, flax, gluten-free flours, millet, quinoa, rice, soy, tapioca, and teff.Common code words for gluten include: hydrolyzed vegetable protein, vegetable protein, glutamate, malt, malt flavoring, modified food starch, flour, cereal, soy sauce and vegetable gum.Avoid any processed food or product that does not specify that it is gluten-free, including spices.
It's especially important to check when eating at a restaurant, eating at a friend's house who does not share your dietary habits, or when trying new prepared foods.

, Preparing food yourself is one of the safest ways to ensure that you’re not consuming gluten. Planning your meals can help you avoid glutinous foods and may prevent abdominal discomfort as well as ensure that you are getting proper nutrients.Make a plan for each meal during the week. Pay special attention for any meals that you don’t eat at home, such as lunch or dinner. In these cases, pack a meal if possible. If not, you may want to scope out restaurants for gluten-free choices.For example, you could start off your week with a cheese and vegetable omelet with a side gluten-free toast with butter and fruit. For lunch you could have a salad with salmon and a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. At dinnertime, you could have a steak with broccoli and a loaded baked potato.

, It can be very difficult to eat in restaurants if you are avoiding gluten. Many use products containing hidden gluten and run the risk of exposing you to cross-contaminated foods. Asking about the menu and avoiding definitively glutinous foods may help prevent discomfort from accidentally consuming even a small amount of gluten.Many restaurants now have gluten-free sections on their menus. If this isn’t the case, you could ask a manager or the chef about potential gluten in the food.
The National Foundation for Celiac Awareness has a list of certified gluten-free kitchens at: http://www.celiaccentral.org/dining/.
Some foods to avoid in restaurants include: croutons, wontons, fried onions and crispy noodles on salads; soups with flour or barley; food marinated in soy or teriyaki sauce; food dusted in flour before sautéing; oil used to fry different types of breaded foods; mashed potato mixes; the breadbasket.Some good choices in restaurants include steamed vegetables, roasted meats, desserts with fruit or ice creams.
Always be prepared if a restaurant doesn’t have your first choice., Exposure to gluten from cross-contaminated foods and products is common. Avoiding cross-contamination as much as possible may help relieve and treat your symptoms.In restaurants, ask if the same surfaces are used to prepare glutinous and gluten-free foods. If you are especially sensitive to gluten, you may want to avoid the restaurant altogether.In your own home, cross-contamination is also possible. Try and use different cutting boards and other preparation surfaces to help prevent cross-contamination.You may also want to avoid using the same appliances, such as toasters, toaster ovens, or pans."

Get surgery.",How to Treat Heartburn," Acidic liquid is naturally-produced by the stomach to help your body break down and digest food. The acid is secreted by parietal cells in the the stomach in response to stimulation by gastrin. It also kills pathogens in your gastrointestinal tract which can prevent infection. There's no way to completely eliminate stomach acid, nor would you want to.


If you notice discomfort or inflammation, you'll need to determine if excess stomach acid is causing the pain.;
, Pay attention to any signs or symptoms of discomfort associated with GERD. These include:Burning and/or sharp chest pain, beneath the sternum (your chest). This burning feeling can extend into your back, neck, and jaw, lasting from seconds to hours. Many people mistake this pain for a heart problem (like.a heart attack or angina). If you are having jaw or arm pain or have a high suspicion that it is chest pain, seek medial attention.
Regurgitation of stomach contents (which tastes like a sour, burning liquid) into your throat and mouth. This can cause a bad taste and increased salivation. You may also feel like you have a lump in your throat.
Decreased hunger or early satiety (needing less food to feel full).
Nausea or sharp, central/upper abdominal pain.
Chronic cough because your throat is irritated.

, Your body has ring of muscle, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that tightens and closes the end of your esophagus where it meets your stomach. This blocks what's in your stomach from traveling back out of the stomach and it ensures that your stomach opens only when you swallow or belch. Sometimes, the LES can fail, causing stomach acid to travel out of the stomach and up into the esophagus. This can happen if:Your stomach is too full (from overeating) or after eating foods that cause bloating and increased gas production (like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, legumes, dairy, high-fat foods).
You strain frequently, like when you lift heavy objects, or exercise vigorously right after eating.
You have a hiatal hernia. This is when the top part of your stomach moves up through the opening in the diaphragm (where the esophagus travels from the chest into the abdomen).
You are overweight, obese, or pregnant. The extra weight on your stomach can increase the pressure across your your stomach, LES, and esophagus.
You lay down too soon after eating a meal. Normally, gravity helps the LES by keeping stomach contents in the lower part of the stomach. If you lay down after eating, the contents can push up and through the LES.
You eat foods that irritate the lining of your esophagus and throat, which can cause inflammation and loosen your LES. Irritants can include caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, acidic foods, and nicotine, which can increase acid production.

, Diet and weight management should be the first steps in treatment. Aim for a healthy, balanced diet that has lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy (avoid dairy product with added sugar and higher calorie content). You should also include lean (low-fat) proteins, like poultry, fish, and beans. Try to cut down saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and avoid things that are high in sodium (salt) and added sugars.


The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a variety of guidelines and nutrition resources available to create your own balanced diet., While there are no specific foods that have been scientifically proven to cure GERD, you can try treating symptoms with natural remedies or avoiding the foods that trigger your heartburn. These trigger foods might include:Caffeine: coffee, tea, soda
Alcohol
Caffeine-like chemicals: chocolate, peppermint
Spicy foods: hot peppers, curry, hot mustards
Acidic foods: citrus fruits, tomatoes, sauces and dressings containing vinegar

, Avoid eating large portions of food. Large, poorly chewed bites can over-fill your stomach, since it takes longer for your stomach to break down food. Instead, eat smaller portions slowly, taking small, thoroughly chewed bites.This will make digestion more efficient and keep you from ingesting extra air, which can cause bloating.


Take your time when you eat. It can take up to 20 minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that you are full. Because of this, people who eat quickly tend to eat more and be more prone to over-filling.

, Use a body mass index (BMI) calculator to determine your healthy weight range according to your height and sex.To lose or maintain weight, count calories by estimating your daily calorie needs and track how many calories you eat. You can simply estimate your daily calorie needs by multiplying your weight in pounds by 10. This number can change, depending on your age, gender, and activity level. For an easier, more accurate calorie estimate, use an online tracker or phone application.A normal BMI is 18.5-24.9. BMIs below 18.5 are underweight, from 25.0-29.9 are overweight, and above 30.0 is defined as obese.
The healthiest rate to lose weight is at about one pound per week. A pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. If you decrease your daily calorie intake by 500, you will lose about one pound per week (500 calories x 7 days/week = 3500 calories/7 days = 1 lb/week)., Adults should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity at least 5 days a week (for a total of 150 minutes). Or, try to get at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days a week and moderate to high intensity muscle strengthening at least twice a week.Do your best to get as much exercise as you can, even if it's just going for a short walk.If you exercise beyond your normal daily activities, you'll be burning calories that can be added to your daily caloric intake. Don't forget that you can track these activities on any fitness logs you use.Remember not to strain or exercise vigorously, especially right after you eat. Give your body time to digest food (3 to 5 hours) or eat smaller meals before exercising., Baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, works as an antacid which can neutralize stomach acid. To use baking soda powder as a treatment, stir ½ to 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water and drink it. You can do this every 2 hours to relieve heartburn.Baking soda is also available in a capsule or pill form, over-the-counter or by prescription. If you're treating children with baking soda, be sure to ask your doctor's advice about dosing., Crush 2 to 3 roots of ginger and boil them in water for 5 minutes. Drinking a ginger or chamomile tea might reduce stress, relieve nausea, and help with digestion. Try drinking 1 or 2 cups of ginger tea about 20 minutes before a meal to calm your stomach and help with digestion.If you notice your GERD is worse when you lay down, try drinking a cup of chamomile tea 30 to 60 minutes before bed. It's thought that this might reduce stomach inflammation and could balance acidity levels., This is a plant that many suggest may help symptoms of GERD. Look for deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) which comes as a powder or tablet. Slowly chew 2 tablets or take 1/2 teaspoon of powder 15 minutes before your meals.Studies show that taking a licorice product that also contains peppermint leaf, German chamomile, caraway, lemon balm, clown’s mustard plant, celandine, angelica, and milk thistle 3 times daily for 4 weeks can reduce your GERD symptoms.Licorice can interact with medications you may be taking, so speak with your doctor before taking it., Chew gum or suck on the lozenges after eating to help your body digest the food. These can make you salivate more, which has been shown to neutralize stomach acid.Choose sugar-free gums or lozenges to avoid extra calories.


Sugar-free gums and lozenges are also a better choice than full-sugar options, which can cause harm your tooth enamel and cause cavities., While studies are needed to prove this connection, some claim that drinking ½ cup of aloe juice may soothe inflammation in your esophagus.Be sure to drink it cool or room temperature before you're ready to eat a meal.


Aloe vera can have laxative qualities, so be prepared before drinking it., Acupuncture is an ancient therapy that uses strategically placed needles on your body to stimulate certain points. Studies have shown that it can significantly improve regurgitation and heartburn. Specifically, acupuncture can change your stomach's acid secretion, alter digestion, and relieve pain.Be sure to find an acupuncturist who is trained and certified. You can check the directory on the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine's website to find someone in your area., If you've made changes to your lifestyle and diet without noticing any symptom relief, see your doctor. Treatment of GERD is critical to prevent severe health problems, like injury or inflammation to your esophagus. The longer your esophagus is inflamed or repeatedly injured, the higher your risk of developing esophageal cancer.Your esophagus lining usually protects itself from stomach acid, but lasting GERD can wear down these defenses.
You may actually suffer from a bacterial stomach infection Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) that might contribute to GERD symptoms. Your doctor will be able to test for the bacteria, which could eventually lead to cancers of the stomach, and suggest a treatment regimen., Usually, GERD is diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms you describe. But, if you've had reflux for a long time or if it doesn't react to medical therapy, you'll probably need to have an upper endoscopy screening. This procedure uses a camera attached to a flexible tube that is placed down the throat to view the throat, esophagus, and stomach. Several biopsies, or tissue samples, are usually taken to determine how inflamed your stomach and esophagus are. Your doctor will then suggest a treatment regimen.During the endoscopy, your doctor will check for H. pylori, the bacteria that may cause GERD symptoms. If your doctor finds it, you'll usually be placed on a triple therapy regimen that includes a proton pump inhibitor (for excess stomach acid), amoxicillin and clarithromycin (antibiotics), which will all be taken twice daily for 7-14 days., To treat mild to moderate GERD, your doctor may recommend taking antacids, in addition to making lifestyle changes and monitoring your diet. Antacids, like calcium carbonate, Tums, or Maalox, are OTC medications that neutralize acid and can be taken as needed, following the packaged instructions. While antacids work quickly, they effects wear off after about an hour. Only use them if you have symptoms once or twice a week.If you over-dose, you may get “milk-alkali syndrome,” which has symptoms including nausea, vomiting, weakness, psychosis, and kidney injury/failure. This comes from getting too much calcium and making the body too alkaline.

, Surface agents, like sucralfate/Carafate stick to the surface of your esophagus and stomach to protect and heal them. You can usually take them as pills or liquids 2 to 4 times a day for 4 to 8 weeks to treat mild to moderate GERD. Side effects are minimal, unless you take them incorrectly for a long time.Many of these surface agents have aluminum, and can lead to aluminum toxicity if taken incorrectly. Symptoms of aluminum toxicity include bone/muscle pain, weakness, anemia, and confusion.

, H2RAs, like cimetidine, ranitidine/Zantac, famotidine/Pepsid,nizatidine block a signalling pathway in the cells of your stomach which then decreases secretion of acid. Take H2RAs as pills twice a day for 2 to 6 weeks to treat mild to moderate GERD. Several types are available OTC and are remarkably safe.Uncommon and rare side effects include: gynecomastia (breast formation in men), impotence, liver dysfunction, confusion, restlessness, low blood pressure, low heart rate, and anemia., PPIs, like omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole are the strongest medications for preventing acid secretion in the stomach. If you have severe GERD with 2 or more episodes of reflux a week, take a PPI (some of which are available OTC). Generally, you should take 1 pill a day, 30 minutes before the first meal of the day, for 8 weeks. Side effects of these include:Bacterial infections of the GI tract which cause diarrhea (like C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella) and pneumonia. Since your stomach acid is reduced and not blocking as much bacteria, these bacterial infections are possible.
Malabsorption: the effects are usually low, but PPI’s can reduce your absorption of iron, vitamin B12, magnesium, and calcium. This can lead to anemia and osteoporosis if PPI’s are taken for very long periods of time.
Drug interactions: taking PPI’s can affect the absorption and metabolism of other drugs. The well-known example of this is with a drug called clopidogrel, which is used to prevent clotting.

, It's rare, but if your GERD symptoms aren't helped by any medical therapy, you may need surgery. Surgery is also an option for young people who may need life-long therapy otherwise. One type of surgery, fundoplication, reinforces your lower esophageal sphincter (LES) by wrapping and sewing a part of your stomach around the esophagus.Another type of surgery closes your lower esophagus by wrapping a string of magnetized beads around your stomach, esophagus, and LES. The beads allow for expansion to let food through.

Let your doctor take a nose and/or throat sample.,

Get vaccinated for prevention.",How to Test for Whooping Cough," Before the pertussis vaccine was developed, whooping cough was mainly a childhood disease.Nowadays, whooping cough mainly affects infants yet to be vaccinated, as well as adults (young and old) whose immunity has faded or were not immunized. If you or your child develop a severe hacking cough that won't go away after a few days or so, then consult with a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated.


Once you catch the infection (from the Bordetella pertussis bacteria) symptoms take about seven to 10 days to develop and are much like those of the common cold: runny nose, congestion, mild fever, mild coughing. This is the first stage of whooping cough, known as the catarrhal stage.After one to two weeks, symptoms will worsen if you have whooping cough because thick mucus accumulates in your airways and triggers uncontrollable coughing fits. This is the second stage, or the the paroxysmal stage.Your doctor will diagnose your infection with specific tests (see below), but will also rule out conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as pneumonia and bronchitis.
The third stage of whooping cough (or the recovery stage) is when the person gradually recovers, usually over a period of two to three weeks.You may still experience coughing spasms and respiratory infections in the months following your recovery from whooping cough.;
, The most characteristic symptom of pertussis is the distinctive high-pitched ""whoop"" made by inhaling air after a coughing spasm, and to a lesser extent, the force of the hacking cough.However, some people (about 50% of adults) don't develop the characteristic whooping sound and sometimes the persistent hacking cough is the only sign that indicates a pertussis infection.Listen to your child after a coughing spasm for the distinctive sound.


Whooping cough can go undiagnosed by doctors because it has become fairly rare, and they have never heard or had the opportunity to hear the characteristic ""whoop.""Other symptoms that may accompany the hacking cough and whooping sound include: a bluish or red face from coughing and not being able to breathe well, extreme fatigue, potential vomiting.
Infants may not cough at all if their airways close from mucus build-up. Instead, they may struggle to breathe and even pass out.

, For a more definitive test, your doctor will take a swab from the area where your nose and throat meet (called the nasopharynx).The mucus on the swab is then grown in a culture and checked under a microscope for evidence of the whooping cough bacteria, Bordetella pertussis. This is the best and most specific way to test for and confirm whooping cough.


Co-infections often occur with whooping cough, so the doctor (or lab tech) may find evidence of other bacteria or viruses in the mucus sample.
There are different strains of Bordetella pertussis and a lab culture can identify which one you have, which may help to determine the best antibiotic to use for treatment.
The best time to take a swab and culture it is during the first two weeks of infection. After that, the sensitivity of the culture test is decreased and the risk of false-negatives increase.

, A swab or sample of mucus from your nasopharynx is also needed to do a PCR test, which amplifies or enhances the genetic material of the bacteria so it can be detected and identified readily.It's a quick assay-based test and has excellent sensitivity for identifying what strain of bacteria is causing the infection. The swab of mucus used to grow a culture can also be used to do a PCR test.


PCR testing should be done within three weeks of symptoms (coughing) developing for best results.
After the fourth week of coughing, the amount of pertussis bacteria DNA in the nasopharynx rapidly diminishes, so PCR testing becomes more unreliable for testing.
In most cases, a pertussis culture and PCR test will both be ordered together when the symptoms are within a few weeks old.

, Your doctor will also take some of your blood and send it to the lab to be analyzed in efforts to determine if you have an infection. Virtually all types of infections (both bacterial and viral) cause the white blood cell count (leukocytes) to increase, which is a sign your immune system is actively trying to fight the infection.As such, looking at leukocytes levels is a general confirmation of infection, but not specific for whooping cough.


Some labs can test for pertussis antibodies, which is a more specific method for testing for a whooping cough infection. The problem is that people produce pertussis antibodies against old infections too.
As such, antibody testing is not useful to determine if a person has an acute (recent) whooping cough infection.
Some pertussis antibodies are present in the bloodstream for a while after vaccination and not indicative of an infection.

, If your symptoms are long lasting or particularly severe, your doctor may also take an x-ray of your chest to check for the presence of inflammation or fluid in your lungs.Whooping cough doesn't usually cause much inflammation in the lungs by itself, but a co-infection with pneumonia often does lead to fluid build up.


Bacterial and viral pneumonia significantly complicates whooping cough (and other respiratory infections), which increases the risk of death.
Fluid build up from pneumonia causes severe chest pain and difficulty breathing, both inhaling and exhaling.

, If your whooping cough infection is diagnosed by your doctor in time (within two to three weeks) antibiotics such as erythromycin can make your symptoms go away more quickly because they can directly kill the Bordetella pertussis bacterial strain.However, most people are diagnosed too late (beyond three weeks), when antibiotics tend to be relatively ineffective. Ask your doctor if you're a good candidate to take antibiotics for whooping cough or not.


Even if it's too late to make much difference in your symptoms, taking antibiotics can help reduce the risk of you spreading the disease to others.
If your whooping cough is particularly severe, your family members may also be given antibiotics by your doctor for prevention.
If you are given antibiotics (typically for two weeks), make sure to follow your doctor's directions exactly, even if you start to feel much better before finishing all the medication.

, Although many people with whooping cough try to use various types of cough syrups to reduce or suppress their symptoms, most are not helpful and can actually prevent getting rid of mucus build up.As such, avoid all cough mixtures, expectorants and suppressants. Instead, focus more on keeping well hydrated (lots of water) and breathing in clean air.


Drinking lots of purified water (at least eight 8-ounce glasses per day) helps wash mucus down so your airways aren't as clogged.
Breathing clean air helps to reduce triggering coughing spells. Keep your home free of irritants such as tobacco smoke, cleaning products and fireplace fumes.

, The best way to prevent whooping cough is to vaccinate your child and get booster shots as an adolescent and adult.The pertussis vaccine is typically given to children in a combination vaccine that gives protection from two other diseases, diphtheria and tetanus. Consequently, the combo vaccine is known as the DTaP vaccine.


Five DTaP inoculations are recommended during childhood, usually at the ages of two months, four months, six months, 15 to 18 months and four to six years.Immunity from the DTaP vaccine tends to wear off by age 11, so doctors recommend a booster shot at that time.
Doctor's also recommended that adults aged 19 years and older receive a booster shot of the TdaP vaccine for prevention, as their immunity may have faded.Common side effects from vaccination include: mild fever, crankiness, headache, fatigue (tiredness) and/or muscle soreness at the injection site.

Note your symptoms.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about different types of antibiotics.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions for how to treat your infection.,
Take the full course of antibiotics that your doctor prescribes.",How to Treat a Bacterial Infection1," The following are symptoms of potential bacterial infections that may require treatment by a physician.Fever, especially with a severe head or neck ache or chest pain
Trouble breathing or pain in the chest
A cough that lasts longer than a week
Rash or swelling that won’t go down
Increasing pain in the urinary tract (which may be pain with urination, in the lower back, or in the lower abdomen)
Pain, swelling, warmth, pus drainage or red streaks extending from a wound.;
, The only sure way to determine what types of bacterial infection you have is to visit a doctor. If you think you have an infection, call your doctor and schedule an appointment right away. Your doctor may perform a blood test, urine culture, or swab of the infected area to determine what type of infection you have.


Remember that bacterial infections can only be diagnosed by a doctor. If you think that you have an infection, note the symptoms and go to the doctor for treatment as soon as possible.

, Asking your doctor about the different types of antibiotics that are available will make it easier for you to understand what your doctor is prescribing.



Broad-spectrum antibiotics fight a wide variety of bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics treat gram positive and negative bacteria, so your doctor may prescribe one of these types of antibiotics if he or she is unsure about what bacteria you have.

Amoxicillin, Augmentin, Tetracycline and Ciprofloxacin are examples of broad-spectrum antibiotics.



Medium-spectrum antibiotics target a group of bacteria. Penicillin and bacitracin are popular medium-spectrum antibiotics.

Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are made to treat one specific kind of bacteria. Polymyxins fall into this small category of antibiotics. Treatment is much easier and more effective when your doctor knows what kind of bacterial infection you have., Your doctor will select the type of antibiotic that works best against the specific bacteria that has caused your infection. Keep in mind that there are many different kinds of antibiotics and only a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic to you.


Make sure that you know exactly how much of the antibiotic you are supposed to take, and when you are supposed to take it. Some antibiotics need to be taken with food, some need to be taken at night, etc. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don’t understand the dosage instructions.

, If you do not take the full course, your infection may get worse. You may also become antibiotic resistant, which can make it hard to treat other infections.


Even if you feel better, you need to take all of the antibiotics to kill the disease causing bacteria that is left in your body. If you stop treatment too soon, you may never fully get rid of the infection."

Get medical treatment.",How to Tell if You Have Internal Hemorrhoids," You might notice some blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. This is the most common symptom of an internal hemorrhoid.


Blood or mucus in your stools can be a symptom of other illnesses as well. It can signal colorectal cancer or anal cancer, as well as hemorrhoids.Be sure to check with your doctor if you experience these symptoms.;
, Many people with internal hemorrhoids will describe a sense that they haven’t finished a bowel movement. This is probably because the bulging veins of a hemorrhoid feel similar to stool in the anus.

, You may feel an internal hemorrhoid that has protruded when you clean around your anus. It will be a pink mass of skin that has poked out of the anus.This is called a prolapse and it can lead to leakage of rectal contents. If you have a prolapse, it can cause some discomfort, but is not usually described as painful.


Internal hemorrhoids are not painful because there are no pain fibers in the veins at that location.

, While hemorrhoids are most often caused by straining during a bowel movement, they can also be caused by obesity, lifting heavy objects, and by pregnancy. In pregnancy, hemorrhoids are due to the extra strain from carrying a baby and the resulting extra pressure on the veins of the lower abdomen., Most internal hemorrhoids can be treated at home by increasing the amount of fiber in your diet and drinking more water. This will soften up and bulk up the stools, making them easier to pass. This will also reduce the internal pressure that can cause hemorrhoids.Eat more foods high in fiber or take a fiber supplement. Follow the directions on the package if you decide to take a fiber supplement.
Drink enough water so that you do not become dehydrated and your stool is softened. It is suggested that you drink between 9 and 13 cups of liquid per day. That is usually 6 to 8 full glasses of water., If you think you have an internal hemorrhoid, and that sense doesn’t go away with increased fiber and water after a few days, you should make an appointment with your physician. Your doctor will determine if you have internal hemorrhoids or if there is another medical problem.


Prepare for your exam by writing down your symptoms, making a list of questions you have for your doctor, and continuing to try to soften your stool.
Classically, hemorrhoids are painless and you can recognize them just from passing bright red blood through your rectum.

, A physician can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by performing a rectal exam. Your doctor will need to look at your anus during this exam, so that he or she will be able to see the hemorrhoid and assess its severity.


Make sure that the doctor does a digital rectal examination. This is when the doctor examines your rectum with a gloved, lubricated finger.

, If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will likely recommend a more extensive test, called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy. This is because rectal bleeding is one of the symptoms of colon cancer.The sigmoidoscopy looks at the rectum and the lower colon, while the colonoscopy looks at the whole colon and rectum.For both of these exams, your doctor will need to insert a scope into your anus.
Anoscopy and endoscopy can also be used to diagnose internal hemorrhoids. With an anoscopy, the doctor inserts a thin lighted tube just a few inches into your rectum.An endoscopy is similar, but the tube might be inserted further into your rectum or colon., Medical treatments of internal hemorrhoids can be awkward and uncomfortable but they are usually essentially painless. Medical treatments for internal hemorrhoids include:Ligation: Tying a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow.
Injection of a chemical solution designed to shrink the hemorrhoid.
Cauterization: burning the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoidectomy: surgical removal of the hemorrhoid.

Prevent a skin infection by properly cleaning and bandaging a wound right away.,
Wash your hands before treating a wound.,
Keep pressure on the wound until it stops bleeding.,
Clean the wound with warm running water.,
Apply ointment.,
Bandage the wound.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Treat a Bacterial Infection2," Proper first aid treatment is essential to helping prevent a bacterial infection, but you should not attempt to treat a severe flesh wound by yourself. If the wound is deep, wide, or bleeding a lot, you should seek medical help immediately., If you treat a wound with dirty hands, you will increase the chances of a bacterial infection. Wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap for 20 seconds and dry them well. Wear clean vinyl or latex gloves if they are available.Avoid latex gloves if you have a latex allergy.

, If the bleeding is severe, seek medical attention immediately. Do not attempt to treat a severe wound by yourself. Go to an emergency room or call 911., Hold the wound under a gentle stream of running water to clean it. Do not use soap on the wound unless it appears visibly dirty. If it does seem dirty, clean around the wound gently with a mild soap. Also, do not use hydrogen peroxide to clean a wound. Hydrogen peroxide can interfere with healing.If you notice any debris in the wound, you can try to remove it with tweezers that have been sterilized with alcohol. If you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can go to a doctor for treatment.

, An antibiotic ointment, such as Neosporin, can help a wound heal faster and can help keep infection at bay. Gently apply the ointment to the wounded area after cleaning.

, If the wound is a small scrape, leave it open to the air. If the wound is deeper, cover it with a sterile gauze.A nonstick bandage held in place with medical tape is the best option for larger wounds, though large band-aids may also work. Be sure that you do not put the adhesive area of a bandage over a wound, as it may re-open the wound when you remove it.


Change the gauze once a day if it is dirty. A good time to change the gauze is when you take a shower.

, If the wound is red, swollen, draining pus, streaking red away from the wound, or just looking worse, call your doctor."

Wash your hands.,
Cover coughs and sneezes.,
Stay home when you are sick.,
Keep your children home when they are sick.Day care centers and schools are often teeming with infectious germs.,
Stay current on vaccines.",How to Treat a Bacterial Infection4," Thorough and frequent hand washing (particularly after touching your face, mouth, or nose if you’re sick, after touching another person who is sick, or after changing a baby’s diaper) can cut down dramatically on the number of germs that you are exposing yourself to.


Wash your hands using soap and warm (or hot) water for at least 20 seconds. Be sure to clean between your fingers and under your fingernails. Then rinse your hands well with clean water., Help others stay well when you are sick by covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. This will help keep your germs reigned in, not allowing them to fly across the room.


Wash your hands after coughing or sneezing into your hands before touching another person or common surfaces such as door knobs or light switches.
You can also cover your mouth or nose with the crook of your arm (the inside of your elbow). This can help limit the spread of germs without causing you to need to wash your hands every 2 minutes while you are sick.

, You can limit the spread of germs by staying away from others while you are ill.If you can, take time off of work (or telecommute for the day); your coworkers will likely appreciate your considerateness.

, It’s common for infections to bounce around from child to child, causing miserable kids and stressed-out parents. Avoid this by keeping your child home when she is sick. She will likely get better faster with your care, and you are helping prevent others from becoming sick as well.

, Be sure that you and your children have received all of the recommended vaccines for your age and geographic area. Vaccines help prevent infections and diseases before they happen, which is preferable to treating them after they have occurred. "

Understand Haemophilus influenzae infections.",How to Treat a Bacterial Infection5," Staphylococci, more commonly referred to as “staph,” are gram-positive cocci in clusters. The “gram” in gram-positive refers to the gram stain pattern of the bacteria when viewed under the microscope. The “cocci” indicates the shape when viewed under a microscope. This types of bacteria usually invades the body through a cut or wound.Staph aureus is the most common type of staph infection. Staph aureus may cause pneumonia, food poisoning, skin infections, blood poisoning, or toxic shock syndrome.
MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a staph infection that is hard to treat. MRSA does not respond to some antibiotics and it is thought that the strain developed in response to antibiotics. Therefore, many doctors will not prescribe antibiotics unless it is absolutely necessary., Streptococci, more commonly referred to as ""strep,"" are gram-positive cocci in chains and a common type of bacteria. Streptococci cause strep throat, pneumonia, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and many more infections., Escherichia coli, or E. coli, is a gram-negative rod, that is found in the waste material of animals and humans. There is a large, diverse group of E.Coli bacteria. Some strains are harmful, but most strains are not. E.Coli can cause diarrhea, gastrointestinal infections, urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and other infections., Salmonella is a gram-negative rod that can disrupt the digestive tract. Salmonella can cause severe illness and it usually requires a lengthy antibiotic treatment. Raw or undercooked poultry, meat and eggs can contain salmonella., Haemophilus influenzae are gram-negative rods. Haemophilus influenzae is transmitted by air so it is highly contagious. It can cause epiglottis, meningitis, otitis media, and pneumonia. This bacteria can cause a severe infection that may lead to a lifelong disability. It can even be fatal.Haemophilus influenzae is not covered by the common “flu shot,” which targets viral influenza, but most children are vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae early in childhood (it is called the “Hib” vaccine).

Be prepared for a variety of reactions.,
Ask for help.",How to Talk to Loved Ones About a Serious Health Condition1," If you have been diagnosed with a serious illness, understand that it is not necessarily your responsibility to share this news with everyone you know. If you are ready to talk about it, one option is to discuss it with one close family member or friend, and then ask them to pass the news on to others. The benefit of this method is that it allows the news to spread somewhat passively, which may be easier for you.You may begin by sitting that person down someplace private.
You can start by saying, ""I have something I need to tell you. I haven't shared this with anyone else. In fact, after I tell you, I'd like it if you could pass this information along."";
, Another option for sharing the news of your illness is to call a meeting with your family and close friends. This offers the benefit of telling many people at once, which may be easier on you. Furthermore, it allows your family and friends to support one another, and to offer a circle of support for you.You can call your friends and family together in your home, or in the home of another family member.
Sit everyone down in a circle.
Start by saying, ""There is something important I need to share with all of you.""
If you struggle with the words, you can be honest. Just explain, ""This is difficult for me to talk about.""
If it helps you, you may want to prepare note cards or a script.

, Your third option is to tell your friends and family members individually, as you see them. This offers the most intimate conversations, which may offer you a deeper sense of support.In this instance, you may not want the people you tell to share this information with others.
If that is the case, be sure to explain, ""I'd rather if you didn't share this with anyone. I'd like to opportunity to tell people myself.""

, No matter which route to sharing this news you select, it may be helpful to ask your doctor or social worker to be present. Your doctor and/or social worker may be able to answer questions about your health, your finances, and what you can expect moving forward. (Of course, how much of this information you choose you share is up to you). A doctor or social worker will also be skilled in navigating these types of discussions, and as such, can offer support.Talk to your doctor or social worker ahead of time to determine what their role will be in this meeting.
When you have these discussions, you can inform your loved ones of the role your doctor or social worker will play.
For instance, you might say, ""Dr. Williams is here to answer any questions you may have,"" or ""Ms. Clancy is here as a kind of mediator, and to offer emotional support.""

, Before you move into these conversations, try to understand that people will react to this news in all kinds of ways. As best as you can, try not to take these initial reactions personally. This news will likely come as quite a shock.Some people may burst into tears.
Others may laugh from nervousness.
Some people will launch into “helpfulness mode.”
Others may say nothing at all.
If you give your friends and loved ones some time, you will likely see a wide range of emotional reactions from each of them, including sadness, anger, and fear.

Nod to show that you are listening.
Ask questions, but don't pry.
For instance, you might say, ""May I ask what treatment plan you're going to follow?""

, Whenever we hear bad news from a friend, it is a natural reaction to try to solve the problem, or make them feel better. Unfortunately, this can make someone feel as though they are not being truly heard. Now is not the time to offer advice, remind them how it could be worse, or otherwise try to cheer them up.Your reaction may be to say, ""At least you have good insurance,"" or ""At least you don't have what Judy had."" Resist this urge. That is not what your loved one needs to hear.
You may be tempted to try and cheer them up. Don't do this. Instead, allow them to feel what they are feeling.
Offer empathetic responses that acknowledge the situation. Saying something as simple as ""Wow, this sucks,"" is sometimes the very best thing to say.

, If you feel dumbstruck, or tongue-tied, don’t allow your own discomfort get in the way of supporting your loved one. If you don’t know what to say (which is understandable), simply admit it and stay present to your loved one.They don’t need to you say anything.

, When you share this kind of news with kids, it is important to inform the other adults in the child’s circle. Talk to teachers, babysitters, or other caregiving family members. If all appropriate adults are kept in the loop, they can be available to help the child cope, and can better understand the child’s behavior.Don't feel like you need to disclose anything you're not comfortable sharing.
You can simply say to a teacher or caregiver, ""We are experiencing a serious illness in the family. We've just told Tommy about it, and we're not really sure how he's going to react.""

, Avoid making this comparison when discussing death or serious illness with the kids in your life.Rather than comparing death to sleep, simply try to describe it as honestly as you, within your family's belief structure.
Children are capable of having complex discussions. Do your best to be honest with them.

Have your fasting glucose measured.It is very challenging for physicians to test for insulin resistance directly; therefore, the most common way in which it is tested for is indirectly, by assessing other quantities that may be indicative of a state of insulin resistance.,
Receive an oral glucose tolerance test.,
Get a simple blood test to have your HbA1c measured.One of the newer tests that is now available to evaluate the amount of glucose in your bloodstream is called HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c).,
Have your LDL cholesterol measured.,
Get your triglyceride levels tested.,
Evaluate your HDL cholesterol.HDL cholesterol, unlike LDL cholesterol, is a ""good cholesterol"" — it is one you want to have high levels of because it performs beneficial functions in the body.,
Talk to your doctor about all of your test results to draw a conclusion about insulin resistance.,
Evaluate for signs and symptoms of insulin resistance.In addition to laboratory tests, there are also signs and symptoms that may be suggestive of insulin resistance.,
Get screened for insulin resistance.You may be wondering: Who should get tested for insulin resistance?,
Talk to your doctor about the risks that insulin resistance can predispose you to.People may ask: Why do we worry about insulin resistance?",How to Test for Insulin Resistance," One key indication that you may be insulin resistant is if your fasting glucose level is elevated.


You will need to get a form from your family doctor (or another physician) sending you for a ""fasting blood test."" A fasting blood test is no different than a regular blood test, other than that it requires that you do not eat or drink (except for water) for eight hours prior to the blood test.Most people find it easiest to fast (i.e. to refrain from eating and drinking) overnight and to have the blood test first thing in the morning.
A normal fasting glucose measurement is less than 100mg/dL.
If your fasting glucose is between 100–125 mg/dL, you have ""pre-diabetes"" and likely have insulin resistance.
If it is above 126 mg/dL on two separate tests, you will be diagnosed with diabetes (and it is key to understand that the diagnosis of diabetes is a more severe form of insulin resistance).;
, In addition to a blood test checking your fasting glucose measurement, your doctor may advise that you receive an oral glucose tolerance test. This test also requires that you fast (do not eat for eight hours prior to the test). The difference is that the oral glucose tolerance test takes between one and three hours.This is a routine test for pregnant women to screen for gestational diabetes.
Your glucose level is measured prior to the start of the test.
You are then instructed to consume a beverage high in sugar, and your glucose levels will continue to be monitored at set time intervals after that to observe how your body manages the glucose load in your bloodstream.
If your body is able to effectively utilize insulin (the hormone that transports glucose from the bloodstream inside cells where it is needed), your results will be normal.
On the other hand, if your body has developed insulin resistance, you will not be able to quickly and effectively transport the glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, and this will show up as an elevated glucose level in your test results.
A glucose result between 140–200 mg/dL on your oral glucose tolerance test is indicative of ""pre-diabetes"" and likely some degree of insulin resistance.
A glucose result over 200 mg/dL on your oral glucose tolerance test is diagnostic of diabetes, which is a more severe form of insulin resistance.

, It gives doctors a three-month snapshot of how your sugar levels have been (i.e. it reflects the average amount of glucose in your bloodstream over the past three months).


Doctors will usually use the A1c blood test or glucose tolerance test, but not both.
It is a highly useful test because it is the only one that offers a long-term profile of your body's ability to process glucose, which reflects back to your body's ability to effectively use insulin.
If you have insulin resistance, your HbA1c value will be elevated due to your impaired ability to manage the glucose load in your bloodstream.
A normal HbA1c is less than 5.6%.
An HbA1c value between 5.7–6.4% is indicative of ""pre-diabetes"" and suggestive of insulin resistance.
An HbA1c value above 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes, which is a later stage and more severe form of insulin resistance.

, LDL cholesterol is commonly known as ""bad cholesterol;' in other words, as the name implies, it is not the type of cholesterol you want to have high levels of. LDL cholesterol can be evaluated in a simple blood test, that you can receive a request for from your family doctor. This is also a fasting blood test, requiring that you do not eat or drink (other than water) for 12 hours prior to the test.An elevated LDL cholesterol reading (above 160 mg/dL) also correlates to a significantly higher risk of having insulin resistance.As such, LDL cholesterol is an indirect way of assessing your probability of having insulin resistance.

, Elevated triglyceride levels are also a risk factor correlated to insulin resistance. Normal triglyceride levels are below 150 mg/dL, and borderline levels are between 150–200 mg/dL. If your triglycerides are above 200 mg/dL, you are likely to have insulin resistance.You will likely receive all of the lipid tests — LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol — at one time, as part of a ""lipid panel.""
Therefore, it is simple to have done as you will only need to go for one blood test to have each of your lipid values assessed, which in turn will provide valuable information as to the probability of you having insulin resistance.

, People with insulin resistance often have lower than normal HDL cholesterol levels; therefore, your HDL cholesterol results on your blood tests will provide insight as to your probability of having insulin resistance.


Normal HDL cholesterol typically falls between 40–50 mg/dL for men and 50–59 mg/dL for women.
If your HDL cholesterol is below 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women, you have a significant risk for having insulin resistance.

, It is the summation of your laboratory test results that determines your likelihood of having insulin resistance.Because insulin resistance is tested for by a variety of indirect measurements (such as testing blood glucose levels as well as blood lipid levels), it is the combination of these various test results that leads to the ultimate diagnosis of insulin resistance.


If you have elevated blood glucose levels, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and reduced HDL cholesterol, you most likely have insulin resistance.
It is important to book an appointment with your doctor to go over all of your test results. Your doctor is the one with the medical training and experience to officially make the diagnosis of insulin resistance. Your doctor can read and interpret the test results, and together you can come up with a treatment plan if necessary.

, These include:


Obesity
Increased waist circumference
Increased thirst
Increased urination
Fatigue
Blurry vision or other vision problems

, If you have clinical signs and symptoms of insulin resistance (described above), you should speak to your doctor about getting tested.


If you are over 45, you are eligible for routine screening of your blood sugars (one of the indirect ways to assess for insulin resistance). If your results are normal upon initial testing, you are eligible for repeat screening tests every three years.
You are also eligible for screening tests for insulin resistance if you have any of the following risk factors: a BMI (body mass index) greater than 25 (i.e. if you are overweight), a sedentary lifestyle, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, a history of heart disease, a history of PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), if you have a close relative who has been diagnosed with diabetes, and/or if you have delivered a baby who weighed over 9 pounds at the time of birth (a larger than normal baby is an indication that you may have poor blood sugar control).

, The answer is because insulin resistance is part of a constellation of health issues that very often go hand-in-hand. If you have one, you are more likely to have (or to develop) the others, because the risk factors for each of these ongoing health conditions are very similar and often overlapping. It is worth talking to your doctor about health conditions that insulin resistance increases your risk of having, including:


Heart disease
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Liver disease
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)

Avoid triggers like bad smells.,
Stay put.",How to Stop Dry Heaving," One of the main causes of dry heaving is that there are not enough fluids circulating in your body, causing fluid imbalance. Your best course of action, then, is to drink plenty of fluids. Remember the rule: drink at least 8-12 glasses of water every day. Sports drinks with electrolytes are good, too, to correct this imbalance.If you cannot tolerate liquids due to the bad taste in your mouth, then rehydrate gradually – start by taking small sips of water, apple juice or mint tea.Dehydration due to dry heaving causes a lot of problems. With the loss of mucus, your body signals your heart to work harder and your kidneys to work double time. When vital organs are stressed it can further lead to total shut down, which, in worst case scenarios, can lead to death.;
, Low blood sugar (or hypoglycemia) is a signal that your body is missing some nutrients that you need to fully function. This can cause dry heaving and also serve as a warning.Luckily, it can be quickly remedied by eating a popsicle or some candy.


Maintaining your sugar levels not only prevents hypoglycemia and dry heaving but also helps in keeping you focused. Eating something sweet will bring glucose to your brain and will also help in transporting oxygen to your blood so that it can properly circulate in the different parts of your body.

, These dry, light or somewhat tasteless foods decreases palate sensitivity in the tongue, which reduces dry heaving, gets rid of that bad taste in your mouth, and may even prevent the urge it from getting worse. They should be soft, not spicy, and low in fiber. Good sources of bland foods are:Soup, broth, bouillon
Cereals (oatmeal, cream of wheat, corn flakes)
Pudding and custard
Eggs
Tofu
Toast
Soda crackers

, Eating a large amount at one time may bring about dry heaves or full on vomiting. Instead of eating 3 full meals a day, split each meal into two and make a 6 meal plan – you're eating the same amount, just throughout the day.


Do not allow your stomach to be empty. This is correlated to maintaining your blood sugar level, too, in addition to taking pressure off your gastric sphincter. While an empty stomach is a trigger for dry heaving to occur, hypoglycemia should also be taken seriously as it can cause myriad other problems like light headedness and nausea., Caffeine is a powerful and addictive stimulant that our bodies easily react to. Since it is such a powerful chemical, it can cause the gastrointestinal tract to become hyperactive, leading to dry heaves and vomiting when too much is consumed. To avoid this, limit your caffeine intake to 250 milligrams per day.Coffee, tea and chocolates are not the only goods with caffeine content. See the label for the amount of caffeine on each product you consume.

, Cold drinks decrease the stimulation of the gastrointestinal system. If you choose something with sugar, that's two benefits in one. However, be sure to only consume what you can tolerate. Start out with a small amount and increase it if you can. Good examples are:


Cold, decaffeinated soda
Ice chips (put in your mouth and let it melt)
Popsicles
Sherbet
A frozen yogurt bar

, These medications are taken to manage allergic symptoms caused by triggers that can also cause vomiting. Taking antihistamines will help in managing the pain that histamines bring about in case you are dehydrated due to dry heaving. One or two tablets of an antihistamine like Benadryl should help stop the urge to vomit.


Histamine is actually an essential chemical messenger in the brain. Also, it manages water intake as well as drought management in the body. It's when these chemicals flare up in allergic reaction that an anti-histamine comes in handy.

, Medications like Bonine and phenothiazines can be taken to help settle gastric contents in your stomach and help stop vomiting. These should be taken once daily or as needed whenever symptoms arise. Talk to your doctor about what's appropriate for you – the dosage will depend upon the severity of your condition.Phenothiazines (Compazine and Phenergan) block dopamine receptors that trigger neurotransmitters for involuntary vomiting. Once these neurotransmitters are blocked, retching will likely cease.

, Quite clearly, anxiety causes stress. When you are stressed, a horde of symptoms manifests which can lead to dry heaving. Taking Ativan or Xanax as needed or when anxiety attacks manifest may greatly help if you suspect stress may be the cause of your dry heaving.


Alprazolam (Xanax) is usually prescribed in a dosage of 0.25 mg thrice a day for short anxiety attacks. However, correct dosing of anxiolytics (anti-anxiety medications) should be at your psychiatrist’s discretion. These are “downers” and need to be taken carefully as they slow and decrease everything from heart rate to organ functioning, etc.

, Sometimes alternative measures such as acupuncture and acupressure are also considered to be effective against dry heaving, especially for pregnant women. The principle involved here is that when energy is unbalanced, illness will develop. In order to restore balance, certain points need to be stimulated in order to reduce episodes of dry heaving as well as relax the gastrointestinal tract. This is where acupuncture comes in.


If you're not fond of needles, consider acupressure or a deep tissue massage. Mention to your masseuse that you're interested in relieving pressure points for the sake of your health.

, Before a night of drinking, try to drink at least 750 mL of water, or however much you can tolerate. Drinking a lot of water before drinking prevents you from being severely dehydrated. With enough water in your system, alcohol gets diluted and its absorption is slowed, therefore delaying the negative effects of overconsumption, like vomiting and dry heaving.


After consuming too much alcohol, alcohol replaces the water in the body making you dehydrated. You end up vomiting until there's nothing left. That's when dry heaving starts. With more water in your system, dry heaves can be avoided.

, Fats reduce alcohol absorption in your body. This too works the same way as taking in more water. It slows the absorption of alcohol to the body thereby delaying its effects. However, there is a difference between healthy fat and unhealthy fat. Here are some sources of fat that will keep you feeling energized and healthy:


Fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, and herring
Walnuts, almonds, and other nuts
Olive, grapeseed, and flaxseed oils
Avocados

, Anxiety and stress is something we all experience. People who have difficulty coping with stress experience signs and symptoms in the body that should be physiological in nature. This is called a “conversion” type of defense mechanism against stress and anxiety. Nausea, vomiting and retching (dry heaving) appears with no exact cause. In order to avoid this, stay relaxed!


Apart from taking anxiolytics, introduce yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises into your routine. If those aren't up your alley, take a vacation. Even if it's half an hour of ""me-time,"" it'll help.

, An awful and stomach-turning smell can give you the urge to dry heave. Common nauseating odors include smoke, perfume and certain food smells. These should be avoided if you're feeling especially sensitive to odors, light, and sound. If you cannot avoid it, wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth or simply use a handkerchief.


Odors trigger dry heaves by sending too much chemical stimuli to the brain. Your olfactory system is highly connected to your digestive system, producing the urge to vomit.

, Plenty of people feel the urge to vomit when they're suffering from motion sickness. This happens when what we see and what our body thinks is our position isn't in conjunction. Simply driving down a windy road can cause it, as can being on a boat, roller coaster, or any other up-and-down, left-and-right, jostling experience.


Try not to listen to people talking about motion sickness. For some unknown reason, a person who listens to people who say that they have motion sickness may get it too. It's like yawning – sometimes it's contagious.
To combat this urge, look at a fixed object (example: the horizon) in travelling in any vehicle. Fixed views do not stimulate the brain, reducing the urge to heave.

Exercise regularly.,
Participate in a non-contact sport.,
Minimize risky sports activities.,
Use protective equipment.",How to Take Lifestyle Precautions for Hemophilia1," Even though it may seem like you should stop exercising when you are diagnosed with hemophilia, you actually shouldn't. Exercise strengthens muscles and helps to limit spontaneous bleeding and joint damage. These things can be serious health problems in hemophiliacs, so exercise is actually an important part of staying healthy.Do exercises that use regular range of motion and do not cause pain in the joints, as bleeding in the joints can be a problem with hemophilia. These exercises can include gentle stretching and balance routines. Simple exercises that use body weight, such as push-ups, are good. Stop immediately if you feel pain.Avoid doing exercise that can be dangerous or cause injury to you.;
, There are some sports that a hemophiliac can do but many can pose a risk to the person's health. When picking a sport, pick one that will limit the risks to your health but will bring you satisfaction and will give you exercise.Sports that can be okay for a hemophiliac to participate in include: swimming, badminton, cycling, and walking.

, All high-contact sports, such as rugby, football, and boxing, should be avoided. These sports can lead to external and internal injuries that can lead to excessive bleeding and even death.You will need to weigh the benefits and the risks before participating in a sport. Additionally, you should take the seriousness of your hemophilia into consideration.

, If you are a hemophiliac and you want to stay active, it's important for you to protect your body from impact. Use protective equipment, for instance knee pads, while exercising or playing sports. This type of equipment can protect you from a potentially devastating injury.


Other protective equipment that can be great for a hemophiliac to use includes helmets and elbow pads. Also, covering up your skin so you do not receive lacerations can be a good precaution for a hemophiliac.

Do not take NSAIDs or aspirin for pain relief.,
Do not take drugs that could cause blood thinning.,
Discuss all over-the-counter and prescription medications with your doctor and pharmacist.",How to Take Lifestyle Precautions for Hemophilia2," Both NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, and aspirin limit blood clotting, which is bad for a hemophiliac. NSAIDs limit the ability of platelets to bond together and aspirin thins the blood.It is safe for a hemophiliac to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief. Acetaminophen does not impact the blood's ability to clot.

, In addition to regular over-the-counter pain relievers, there are some prescription medicines that can promote thin blood or limit clotting. These should be avoided by hemophiliacs as well. Make sure all health care providers are aware of your condition so they do not prescribe these medications.They include:Heparin
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Clopidogrel (Plavix)
Prasugrel

, If you are a hemophiliac you will need to discuss your condition with all doctors and medical professionals that you consult with. This means that even if a doctor is not treating your hemophilia directly, they should be aware of the condition in case of a prescription medication being prescribed that could impact your clotting as a side effect.If your doctor prescribes a new medication, you can simply ask them ""Will this medication have any impact on my hemophilia?"" You could also say ""I just want to be sure this treatment will not cause my hemophilia to worsen."" Above all, just be clear and to the point.
In most cases, a doctor will consult your medical records before treating you, thus knowing that you have hemophilia. However, it is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to risks to your health.

Wear a medical alert ID bracelet.,
Get immediate medical care.,
Take the proper precautions when traveling.",How to Take Lifestyle Precautions for Hemophilia3," If you have hemophilia, having bleeding gums can be a serious health issue for you. With this in mind, take the time to care for your teeth, so that they stay healthy, and get regular dental care.Find a dentist that is experienced with treating patients with hemophilia. They will have a better understanding of the condition and will give you medication that can limit bleeding during treatments.

, Follow your doctor's directions for treatment and preventative care. This includes having clotting factor replacement therapy when necessary and having regular exams to assess your condition.How often you go in for factor replacement treatment will vary. Some patients will need to go in every day if they have a severe case of hemophilia. Others will have to go in very rarely, perhaps once a year, if their condition is very mild.You will also want to have regular vaccinations in order to avoid illnesses that could be very serious due to your hemophilia.

, Another option is to carry a card, but you should always have something on your person that indicates you have hemophilia. This way if you are involved in an accident or there is an emergency, medical personnel can treat you appropriately. The card will have more room and can inform them of any treatments you are on, medications you take, and any allergies., If you become ill or have an injury that won't stop bleeding, you will need to get medical care right away. If you have hemophilia you need to be proactive about your health and treatment of health problems. Even a bruise on a person with severe hemophilia can become a serious health issue if it goes uncared for.You will need to learn when you need medical care and when you do not. This largely depends on your level of hemophilia and the treatment that you are receiving for it.
Look for signs of bruising and pay attention to bleeding that doesn't stop. Also pay attention to signs of internal bleeding, including bleeding on the brain. These include a persistent headache, weakness or swelling in the limbs, vomiting, lethargy, and inability to move or bear weight.

, If you are planning to travel, you will need to do some additional preparation first. Find out where hemophiliac clinics are located around your destination and keep their contact information handy. Bring extra medication (talk to your doctor if you need them to prescribe extra), and carry with you written instructions on dosing of your medication and what emergency medications you require."

Medication. Medications that can cause SJ include

Anti-gout medications, such as allopurinol
Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Medications to fight infection, such as penicillin
Medications to treat seizures or mental illness (anticonvulsants and antipsychotics)



Therapy.

Radiation Therapy



Infection. Infections that can cause SJ include

Herpes (herpes simplex or herpes zoster)
Pneumonia
HIV
Hepatitis

;
,



Active symptoms include

Facial swelling
Tongue swelling
Hives
Skin pain
A red or purple skin rash that spreads within hours to days
Blisters on the skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, eyes and genitals
Shedding of the skin



Preceding symptoms (developing several days before the active symptoms start) include

Fever
Sore mouth and throat
Fatigue
Cough
Burning eyes



, Factors that increase your risk of developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome include:


Viral infections. Your risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be increased if you have an infection caused by a virus, such as herpes, viral pneumonia, HIV or hepatitis.
Weakened immune system. If you have a weakened immune system, you may have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Your immune system can be affected by an organ transplant, HIV/AIDS and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus.
A history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If you've had a medication-related form of this condition, you are at risk of a recurrence if you use that drug again.
A family history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If an immediate family member has had Stevens-Johnson syndrome or a related condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, you may be more susceptible to developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome too.
Having a certain gene. If you have a gene called HLA-B 1502, you have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, particularly if you take certain drugs for seizures or mental illness. Families of Chinese, Southeast Asian or Indian descent are more likely to carry this gene.

, Stevens-Johnson syndrome complications include:


Secondary skin infection (cellulitis). Cellulitis can lead to life-threatening complications, including sepsis.
Blood infection (sepsis). Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter your bloodstream and spread throughout your body. Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition that can cause shock and organ failure.
Eye problems. The rash caused by Stevens-Johnson syndrome can lead to inflammation in your eyes. In mild cases, this may cause irritation and dry eyes. In severe cases, it can lead to extensive tissue damage and scarring that results in blindness.
Damage to internal organs. It's unusual for this condition to affect internal organs. But it may cause inflammation of the lungs, heart, kidneys or liver.
Permanent skin damage. When your skin grows back following Stevens-Johnson syndrome, it may have abnormal bumps and coloring. And you may have scars. Lasting skin problems may cause your hair to fall out, and your fingernails and toenails may not grow as they used to do.

, Stevens-Johnson syndrome requires immediate medical attention. Seek emergency medical care if you experience any of the following signs or symptoms:


Unexplained widespread skin pain
Facial swelling
Blisters on the skin and mucous membranes
Hives
Swelling of the tongue
A red or purplish skin rash that spreads
Shedding of the skin

,


Put in a small bag all the medications you've taken in the last three weeks, including prescription and over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs. Take the bag with you, as it may help the doctor figure out what triggered your condition.
Ask a family member or a friend to come along, if he or she is available immediately. You may want to share relevant health information about yourself with him or her, so this person can help you when you talk with your doctor.
Questions your doctor may ask include:

Have you had a flu-like illness recently?
What other medical conditions do you have?
What medications have you taken in the last three weeks?


Don't hesitate to ask your physician:

What caused my condition?
How do I keep from having this reaction again?
What restrictions do I need to follow?
I have other medical conditions. How do I manage them together?
How long will it take my skin to heal?
Am I likely to have any permanent damage?



, Tests and procedures used to diagnose Stevens-Johnson syndrome include:


Physical exam. Doctors often can identify Stevens-Johnson syndrome based on your medical history, a physical exam, and corroborating the signs and symptoms of the disorder.
Skin test. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may remove a sample of skin for laboratory testing (biopsy).

, Stevens-Johnson syndrome requires hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit or burn unit.


Stopping nonessential medications: The first and foremost important step in treating Stevens-Johnson syndrome is to discontinue any medications that may be causing it. Because it's difficult to determine exactly which drug may be causing the problem, your doctor may recommend that you stop taking all nonessential medications.
Replacing the causative medication, if it can be identified and if it is essential (e.g., Carbamazepine for Seizure Disorder).
Supportive care: Supportive care you're likely to receive while hospitalized includes:

Fluid replacement and nutrition. Because skin loss can result in significant loss of fluid from your body, replacing fluids is an important part of treatment. You may receive fluids and nutrients through a tube placed through your nose and advanced into your stomach (nasogastric tube), and/or through an intravenous channel.
Wound care. Cold, wet compresses will help soothe blisters while they heal. Your health care team may gently remove any dead skin and place a medicated dressing over the affected areas.
Eye care. You may also need to be seen by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).


Medications. Medications commonly used in the treatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome include:

Pain medication to reduce discomfort
Medication to relieve itching (antihistamines)
Antibiotics to control infection, when needed
Medication to reduce skin inflammation (topical steroids)


If the underlying cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be eliminated and the skin reaction stopped, new skin may begin to grow over the affected area within several days. In severe cases, full recovery may take several months.

,


If you have had Stevens-Johnson syndrome, be sure to know what caused your reaction. If your condition was caused by a medication, learn its name and that of closely related medications.
If you are of Asian descent, consider genetic testing before taking certain drugs. If you are of Chinese, Southeast Asian or Indian descent, talk with your doctor before taking carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol). This drug is useful to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and other conditions; but people with a gene called HLA-B 1502 have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome if they take this drug.
If you've had this condition, avoid the medication that triggered it. If you've had Stevens-Johnson syndrome and your doctor told you it was caused by a medication, avoid that drug and others like it. This is key to preventing a recurrence, which is usually more severe than the first episode and can be fatal.
Your family members also might want to avoid this drug because some forms of this condition have a genetic risk factor.
Have information about your condition and what caused it inscribed on a medical information bracelet or necklace. Always wear it.

, Don't forget to inform all your health care providers that you have a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If the reaction was caused by a medication, tell them which one.

Get plenty of rest.While many people tend to push through an illness, you will get over a dry cough quicker if you allow yourself to rest and rejuvenate.,
Keep the air humidified.,
Drink lots of warm fluids.,
Eat small, nutritious meals.,
Gargle with warm salt water if your throat hurts.,
Consider letting your cough run its course.",How to Stop a Dry Cough1," If you push yourself, you are also likely to infect friends, family and co-workers, as well as risk become worse by running down immune system.


It can be tough, but if you need to, take a day off from work. Keep your kids home from school as well. Their teacher and all the other parents will appreciate it!
Virus's are often spread through droplets sprayed by coughing. Make sure you or your child always cover your mouth when you cough. Try to cough into the crook of your elbow and wash your hands immediately if you cough into them.;
, Use a vaporizer or take hot, steamy showers. You can also leave bowls of water around the house, especially near sources of heat, so that the water evaporates into the air.

, Drink water, water, and then more water. You can add honey and lemon (another source of Vitamin C), and warm up the water. Other fluids can include tea, juices, and clear chicken or vegetable broths. While you should try to keep hydrated at all times, it's even more important when you have a cold. If you have a dry cough, you want to moisturize that cough.


At a minimum, try to drink eight to 10 8-ounce glasses of water a day.
Try drinking green tea, as it contains antioxidants.

, Try to eat small amounts of easily digestible food. Avoid greasy and heavy foods. You want to give your immune system enough energy to fight off the illness, so you will need to eat these meals frequently. Include quality protein, such as fish and skinless poultry, as well as complex carbohydrates. Some good foods to eat when you are sick include:


Hot cereal, such as oatmeal: Adding a pinch of cayenne pepper can help break up the mucus and increase drainage.
Yogurt: the active bacterial cultures can boost your gut bacteria and boost your immune system at the same time.
Foods rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants: Foods that have high levels of Vitamin C include red peppers, oranges, berries (like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries) and leafy green vegetables.
Foods rich in beta-carotene and vitamin A: These include any yellow or orange food, including carrots, squash and sweet potatoes.
Chicken soup: Keep it light with brown rice and a few easily digestible vegetables, such as spinach, peas, carrots, celery, or summer squash.

, Salt water will have little effect on your cough, but it can soothe a sore throat, which may accompany a cough. Add 1 teaspoon of salt (table salt or sea salt both work fine) to about 6-ounces of warm water. Stir to dissolve the salt and then gargle with it.


Don’t swallow! Just gargle and spit it out.
The salt water does at least two things: First, the salt helps reduce any swelling in your throat, making a cough less likely. Second, the sea salt can help supply various minerals that can be useful for the immune system (zinc, selenium, magnesium).

, Coughing is the body’s natural way of literally getting rid of the virus or other pathogen. Coughing also gets rid of the phlegm (mucus) that builds up during an infection or as a reaction to an irritant. So, it is generally best not to suppress a cough and to let your body get rid of the virus and fluids that are making your life miserable.


On the other hand, the reality is that coughing can really affect your well-being. In some cases, coughing won’t let you sleep and causes it to hurt when you breathe. If this is the case, it's probably a good time to consider a cough suppressant.

"
"
Take an over-the-counter cough suppressant.,
Determine the cause of your cough to narrow possible treatments.,
Get your medication changed.,
Get immediate medical care if you have severe symptoms.",How to Stop a Dry Cough2," Use cough drops, hard candies, or throat sprays to ease a dry cough. These can be found at any local pharmacy or drugstore and are usually very effective for less-serious coughs.

, A dry, non-productive cough is most commonly associated with irritations in the throat. These are mostly minor, but can be very annoying. A dry cough can also be due to:


Inhaling an environmental irritant
Certain medications: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Beta-blockers in particular. Both ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are prescribed to treat high blood pressure and some heart diseases.
Some disorders including Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), tuberculosis, viral infections and congestive heart failure.
Smoking
Post-nasal drip: irritating the throat and causing a reflex cough
Allergies
Asthma, especially in children
Chronic bronchitis

, If you are on an ACE inhibitor or other medication that you suspect is the reason for your cough, speak to your physician about changing the medication or the dosage. That may be sufficient to eliminate the cough.


For other causes of a cough, make sure you have a proper diagnosis and are being treated for the underlying disorder. If the cough does not disappear after that, you may need to get a second opinion about the specific cause of your cough.

, If you don’t get any relief after several weeks OR if you experience any of the ""red flag"" symptoms, call your physician for an appointment. Symptoms that are red flags and require immediate medical care include:


If you or your child are coughing up thick, greenish-yellow phlegm
If you or your child are wheezing, or there is a whistling sound at the beginning or end of the breath
If you or your child experience have ANY odd sounding cough and have difficulty catching your breath, especially at the end of a cough.
If you or your child experience a fever of more than 100.4°F (38°C)
If you or your child experience any shortness of breath
If you or your child has a whooping cough. Whooping cough has been on the rise, likely because of decreased immunization rates and the appearance of new bacterial strains. It is characterized by fits of uncontrolled, violent coughs making it very hard to breathe. The deep breaths that follow a fit of coughing often sound like a “whoop.” This is a highly contagious disease that can be prevented and treated. Early treatment is very important."

Eat honey to calm your cough.,
Take a combination of honey and lemon.,
Use a mixture of honey, lemon, and garlic.,
Make a mixture of honey, lemon juice, and ginger.,
Combine one cup honey and one thinly sliced lemon in a small saucepan.,
Substitute glycerin for honey.",How to Stop a Dry Cough3," Honey has both antibacterial and antiviral properties. In fact, honey is better at soothing coughs than dextromethorphan, a commercial cough suppressant.Do not give honey to any child under one year old. There is a very small risk of getting infant botulism from the bacterial toxins sometimes found in honey.Infants have an immature immune system and being exposed to botulism could cause fatal outcome.
Medicinal honey (Manuka honey from New Zealand is recommended) but any organic honey will have antibacterial and antiviral properties.

, Lemon should be added to honey for cough treatment because lemon juice contains high levels of Vitamin C. The juice of one lemon contains 51% of the daily Vitamin C requirement. Lemon juice also has antibacterial and antiviral properties.


To take honey and lemon, gently warm up one cup of honey in a small saucepan. Add 3–4 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice, 4–5 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice, or a whole lemon, cut into thin slices. Heat over a low flame for 10 minutes stir constantly, until the mixture is warm and the lemons (if you used them) are broken up. Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir. Take 1–2 tablespoons as needed. Refrigerate the mixture.

, This recipe may work better for adults and children who enjoy garlic. Garlic has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal properties.


Combine one cup honey and one lemon, finely sliced in a small saucepan. Peel two to three cloves of garlic and chop them as finely as possible. Add this to the honey-lemon mixture. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes. Stir in ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture. Keep heating briefly over the low flame. Take 1–2 tablespoons as needed and keep the mixture in the refrigerator.

, Ginger is often used to improve digestion and to treat nausea and vomiting, but it is also used as an expectorant. It thins out mucus and phlegm and is a bronchial relaxant. This means that the urge to cough can be decreased by taking ginger.

, Cut and peel about 1.5 inches of fresh ginger root. Finely grate it and add it to the honey-lemon mixture. Heat this honey, lemon, and ginger mixture over low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to this mixture and stir in while heating over the low flame. Take 1–2 tablespoons as needed and refrigerate the remaining mixture.


Allow the mixture to cool before taking it to avoid burning your mouth.

, If you don’t have, don’t like, or can’t use honey, substitute glycerin. You should get natural glycerin (and not the synthetic or man-made form). Use ½ cup of glycerin instead of one cup honey in the recipes provided.


Glycerin has a “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) status with the FDA.Pure glycerin is a colorless and somewhat sweet vegetable product that is used to make all sorts of indigestible products and personal care products. Because it takes up water, it can be helpful in small amounts to reduce any swelling in the throat.
Be aware that glycerin is used to treat constipation, so if diarrhea becomes a problem, reduce the amount of glycerin used.
Prolonged and excessive ingestion of glycerin can increase blood sugar and blood fat levels.

Take peppermint.,
Use marshmallow root.,
Add thyme to your tea.,
Eat ginger root.,
Drink turmeric milk.,
Take a combination of fish oil and citrus juice.",How to Stop a Dry Cough4," Peppermint is considered safe for children and adults. Peppermint can be used as a tea. Put 1–2 teaspoons of the dried herb in 1 cup of boiled water and brew for two to four minutes. Peppermint can also be used as a steam treatment.


To use as a steam treatment, add 1–2 teaspoons of dried herb to 2 cups of boiled water in a bowl. Being careful to avoid scalding, place your face over the bowl of water (make sure there is at least a distance of 12 inches between your face and the water), cover the back of your head with a towel, and breathe the fumes in through your nose and mouth.
As with all herbs, there is a chance you can have an allergic reaction. Try a small amount of tea or steam and wait 30 minutes. If there is no reaction, you can proceed.

, Marshmallow root is not the soft, spongy candy but, like the candy, it is considered safe for children and adults. It is also known as Althaea officinalis and has been used for centuries as a cough suppressant. In herbal medicine, it is known as a demulcent, which is an herb that relieves irritation, usually by decreasing inflammation.


Like peppermint, marshmallow root can be used as a tea or a steam treatment.
To make marshmallow root tea place 1–2 teaspoons of dried herb in 1 cup of boiled water. Brew for a few minutes and then remove the herb. Sweeten with honey if you want. Because there is a small risk of allergy, as with all herbs, try a small amount of tea and wait 30 minutes. If there is no reaction, you can proceed.

, Thyme has been traditionally used as a cough suppressant and for sore throats. It is considered safe for children and adults and can be used as a steam treatment as well.

, Ginger root has been used for centuries as a cough suppressant and to increase salivation, which can relieve a dry throat. The easiest way to use ginger is to cut off a small, quarter-sized slice of fresh ginger root and simply chew it. If the taste of ginger is too strong, try making a ginger tea or a ginger steam.Ginger root is considered safe for children and adults

, Turmeric milk is a traditional treatment for cough.Mix ½ teaspoon of turmeric in one glass of warm milk. If you don’t like milk, try soy or almond milk.

, Combine ½ ounce of fish oil with the juice of one lemon or one orange. They won’t mix very well. The fish oil provides Vitamins A, D and E and the citrus provides Vitamin C, all of which can be beneficial in relieving your cough. In addition, the citrus does a pretty good job of covering the fishy taste of the oil.


Hold your nose as you drink the fish oil and juice mixture. The perception of taste is based on a number of senses, and if you can’t smell it, the taste won’t be as strong.

Use healing coconut oil.,
Make a cayenne pepper “cream.” Cayenne contains capsaicin, a natural chemical that lends the cayenne its “spiciness.” Capsaicin inhibits Substance P, a neurochemical that controls your body’s pain responses.Add warm water to a small amount of ground cayenne pepper to make a thick paste and apply to the sore.Use this paste two to three times daily for pain relief.,
Chew on anti-inflammatory basil leaves.,
Make a clove oil cotton ball.,
Apply a soothing chamomile compress.,
Make a numbing spray using essential oils.",How to Stop a Mouth Ulcer from Hurting1," Some natural remedies are quick and easy to make using ingredients you probably have in your pantry. Others, while easy, may either require ingredients only available at specialty food stores or may take time to prepare.


Try various home remedies until you find the ones that work for you.
Be aware of any food allergies or other sensitivities you may have before trying any home remedies. You may also wish to run it by your doctor before you try a home remedy.;
, This method is the fastest way to pain relief, although the relief may be temporary. Allowing ice chips to slowly dissolve over the sores will temporarily numb the area and may reduce the inflammation.

, Osmosis occurs when the inside of a cell has a lower salt content than the outside. Water, or excess fluid, is drawn out of the cell and swelling goes down, easing discomfort.Salt is an antiseptic, so it will help to keep the area free of bacteria to promote healing.
Try a baking soda rinse instead, using 1 teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water., Sage has long been used in ancient cultures for cleansing and healing of mouth ailments. Mix 2 teaspoons dried sage with 4–8 ounces of fresh water and boil for 10 minutes. Let it cool, then swish the rinse in your mouth for one minute. Spit it out and rinse your mouth with cold water.Alternatively,combine a handful of fresh sage with 4–8 ounces of water. Store in an airtight glass jar in a cool dark place for 24 hours. Remove the sage and swish only the infused water in your mouth for one minute., Aloe’s sunburn-soothing properties are well known, but this plant can also ease the pain of a canker sore. Mix 1 teaspoon of natural aloe vera gel with 1 tablespoon of water and swish it in your mouth three times a day.


Be sure to use natural aloe vera gel.
Try using aloe vera juice as a rinse., Coconut oil is an anti-inflammatory, which not only helps with healing, but may reduce pain. Use a cotton swab or clean hands to apply a liberal amount of coconut oil directly onto the mouth ulcer to ease pain and encourage healing.


If the oil melts too quickly and slides off, you may not be using enough.
If you’re still having trouble keeping the oil on the sore, add ½ teaspoon of beeswax to thicken to a paste.Chew on fresh or dried coconut to achieve a similar pain-reducing effect.,
Cayenne pepper also promotes saliva production, which can promote oral health and aid in healing the sore., Research has shown that chewing basil leaves is an effective anti-inflammatory, which may mean that it can reduce swelling and pain of mouth ulcers.To ease pain, chew four to five basil leaves four times a day.


Chewing clove buds and swishing the juice around the ulcer may help, too., Clove oil has been shown to numb tissue as well as benzocaine, the topical anesthetic that most dentists use for minor dental procedures.Soak a cotton ball in a mixture of 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and four to five drops of clove essential oil and apply directly to the sore for five to eight minutes for pain relief.Rinse your mouth out with warm water before and after this treatment so that oil can be fully effective.
Clove oil has a strong taste that some users find unpleasant, and accidental ingestion of too much oil can have side effects., Chamomile tea contains bisabolol, or levomenol, a naturally-occurring chemical compound which can reduce inflammation and, thus, pain.Soak one bag of chamomile tea in warm water for one minute, then place it directly against the sore for five to 10 minutes twice a day.Chamomile has been found to soothe the digestive tract and ease gastrointestinal issues, which may be an underlying cause of mouth ulcers.You can also try a compress of fresh sage. Combine a handful of fresh sage with 4–8 ounces of water. Store in an airtight glass jar in a cool dark place overnight. Remove the sage and use a mortar and pestle to mash the leaves to a pulp. Apply this mash directly over the sore for five minutes.Always rinse your mouth with plain cold water after applying compresses or herbs.

, Many essential oils have anti-inflammatory properties, and peppermint and eucalyptus may also work as antimicrobial agents to reduce your chances of infection. Additionally, they may reduce swelling due to the astringent nature of these oils, which tightens the surrounding tissues. You might also experience a slight numbing effect due to their cooling properties.Combine 2 tablespoons of olive or grapeseed oil, 10 drops of peppermint essential oil, eight drops of eucalyptus essential oil in a mister bottle. Cap and shake well before use.
Spray the mist, as needed, directly onto the canker sore for pain relief."

Identify the shortened ligament.,
Stretch the joint to its end range.,
Hold the position for 30 seconds.,
Gently release the position.",How to Stretch Ligaments1," Shortened or contracted ligaments usually occur due to trauma, faulty posture, or general disuse. When the ligaments of a joint contract, they limit that joint's range of movement.Ligaments held in shortened positions tend to shorten over time, which could happen if you have habitually bad posture; for instance, if you always slump forward while sitting, the ligaments at the front of the shoulder may shorten.
Ligament contraction can also occur when joints are immobilized. For instance, if you have your arm in a sling for several weeks, your shoulder joint will be unable to move and the ligaments it contains can shrink.
If you suspect that the ligaments in one or more of your joints have contracted, it's best to confirm your suspicions with a doctor, physical therapist, or other professional before attempting to stress and elongate the those ligaments.;
, Relax your body, then slowly stretch the targeted joint to its end range, stopping before you feel any pain.


Focus on a stretch that targets the joint in question. For example, if you're experiencing a loss of movement in your shoulder and wish to target the ligaments there, you might extend your arm to its end range in the direction of the restriction.
The ""end range"" refers to the point at which you feel discomfort in the surrounding muscle without feeling any pain. Never push yourself to the point of feeling pain since overworking the area may cause the ligaments to tear.

, Once you reach the end range of your joint, hold the stretched position for a full 30 seconds.As you stretch, your muscles automatically contract and increase their tone. The involved muscles usually hold this contraction for 15 to 20 seconds.
After 15 to 20 seconds pass, the muscles relax, granting you access to the joint and its ligaments. For the remaining 10 to 15 seconds, you'll be able to stretch or stress the ligaments themselves.

, After 30 seconds pass, gradually relax the joint and return it to its resting position.


Avoid sharp or quick motions. Release the position over several seconds instead of instantly dropping the joint to its resting position. When working with ligaments, all involved movements should be slow and steady.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for suggestions.,
Apply Milk of Magnesia directly to your canker sore.,
Try topical benzocaine.,
Apply an approved over-the-counter medicine containing pain-relieving ingredients.,
Ask your doctor for prescription mouth rinse to heal the sore.,
Ask your doctor for a more powerful medication if you have several sores.,
Talk with your doctor about a cautery of your sore.",How to Stop a Mouth Ulcer from Hurting2," Your doctor knows your medical history and can discuss your options based on your particular situation. Pharmacists are experts in medication and chemistry and can discuss over-the-counter options for pain relief.


Always contact your doctor or pharmacist before using any medication for non-approved purposes, even if it seems safe.
Be sure to keep all of the safety and information documents that come with your purchase, so that you can check for side effects and dosages.

, Milk of Magnesia may provide some pain relief if you apply some to your canker sore a few times a day, as needed. You can also try holding the Milk of Magnesia or Maalox in your mouth to wash and coat the sore for some relief of swelling and inflammation.You can also try brushing your teeth using a soft brush and toothpaste free of foaming agents, such as Biotene or Sensodyne. ProNamel., This numbing medication is sometimes used to ease the pain when a baby is teething, though the FDA now recommends against it. If you follow the dosages correctly, however, you can also use the gel on a canker sore to numb the pain.During application to your mouth or gums, avoid swallowing the medication.
After application, you should avoid eating for an hour.
There is a risk for a rare but life-threatening side effect of this kind of medication called methemoglobinemia. This condition reduces the amount of oxygen in your blood stream to dangerously low levels., These drug ingredients have been approved for pain relief and may help ease your pain quickly. They may even help with healing, if applied soon after the appearance of a mouth ulcer.Benzocaine-containing products numb the area temporarily, easing discomfort.
Fluocinonide is an anti-inflammatory that may help with pain relief as the inflammation is reduced.
Hydrogen peroxide, as an ingredient in medicine, works as an antimicrobial agent, preventing infection and promoting healing, although it should never be used alone.

, Contact your doctor if you’re having trouble brushing your teeth or eating because of the pain of a mouth ulcer. She can prescribe a medicated substance to put on the sore to help the healing process, which will also alleviate your pain.


Antimicrobial mouthwashes help kill bacteria, viruses or fungi that could infect the ulcer. Keeping your mouth clean will help the ulcer to heal and will lessen the pain.Benzydamine, available as a mouthwash or spray, offers local anaesthetic (numbing) and anti-inflammatory properties for pain relief.Note that this mouthwash should not be used for children under 12 years of age and you shouldn’t use it for more than 7 days., These medications for mouth ulcers are usually a last resort, but your doctor may prescribe a mouth rinse containing corticosteroid. These medications are anti-inflammatories and can offer powerful pain relief.


These medications may not be safe for children under 12.
Ask your doctor about the potentially serious side effects of corticosteroids., If your ulcer is extremely large and or painful, you and your doctor may consider a cautery. For this procedure, an instrument or chemical substance is used to burn, sear or destroy the tissue to potentially reduce healing time.


Debacterol, a topical solution created to treat canker sores and gum problems, may reduce healing time to about a week.
Silver nitrate, another chemical solution, may not speed the healing process, but can ease the pain of a mouth ulcer."

Sodium lauryl sulfate, an ingredient in many toothpastes and mouth rinses, may cause a reaction in your mouth which leads to a canker sore.
Food sensitivities to things like chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods or a diet lacking in vitamin B-12, zinc, folate (folic acid) or iron may cause canker sores.

, Minor, localized injuries to your mouth, such as biting the inside of your cheek, a sports accident, or brushing your teeth too vigorously, may inflame the tissue and cause an ulcer.


Wear a mouthguard during contact sports to prevent accidental cheek biting or other damage from your teeth.
Use only a toothbrush with a soft head to brush your teeth.

, Some diseases and conditions, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet’s disease, and various autoimmune disorders may make you more prone to mouth ulcers. Ask your doctor for more ways to prevent mouth ulcers in your circumstances., Sometimes a misaligned or sharp tooth, or dental implements such as braces or dentures, rub against the inside of your cheek, irritating your canker sore. A homemade wax “cap” can protect ease the pain by protecting the sore from that friction.


Melt 1 tablespoon of beeswax and 2 teaspoons of coconut oil together. After it has cooled, press a small amount over the area of your tooth or dental devices that rubs the sore.
If you have braces, use enough wax that it creates an actual barrier, rather than just pushed into and around the brace.

, If the canker sore has been caused by a sharp tooth or filling irritating the inside of your cheek, you should feel relief as soon as you seek treatment.Your dentist will tell you if you are a candidate for recontouring. If your enamel is too thin, any filing may cause sensitivity to temperature that may be painful.Your dentist can ""recontour"" your teeth by removing tiny bits of enamel with a sanding disc or a fine diamond burr. He or she will shape and smooth the sides with sandpaper, and then will polish your tooth or teeth., Some research shows an increase in canker sores as stress levels increase. Try adding relaxing activities to your routine such as yoga, meditation, or exercise."

Grab something steady.,
Push forward.,
Hold the position for 30 seconds.,
Repeat using the other hand.",How to Stretch Ligaments2," If you're at the gym, grab onto a chest-high stretch bar. If you're at home or at your office, grab onto the edge of a desk or the knob of a closed door.


The exact object doesn't matter, but it should be stationary, steady, and between waist and chest height. You'll be using it to keep yourself steady as you perform the stretch.
Grab the bar with only one hand and keep the rest of your posture relatively straight, yet limber. You should be standing with your feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Do not lock your knees.

, Gently push your chest forward while holding onto the bar. Continue stretching until the muscles of your chest feel mild discomfort without feeling any pain.This position should allow you to stretch the chest, shoulders, and biceps. You should feel the muscle groups in those areas contract as you stretch.
Essentially, you're pushing these muscle groups to their end range. Do not push them beyond this point, however, since doing so could cause pain and greater damage.

, Continue leaning forward for a full 30 seconds, then gradually release your position and return to an upright stance.


For the first 15 to 20 seconds, this stance will stretch your muscles. During the final 10 to 15 seconds, the muscles will relax, and the connective ligaments lying beneath will begin to stretch.
Return to an upright stance over several seconds rather than darting back instantaneously. Sharp movements can actually cause damage.

, Grab the same steady object with your other hand, then lean forward again for another 30 seconds.


Other than the hand you use, everything about this second stretch should be the same as the first.
Switching hands will allow you to stress the ligaments in both shoulders.

"
"
Grab something steady.,
Lean backward.,
Hold the position for 30 seconds.",How to Stretch Ligaments3," Stand with your knees slightly bent and your feet shoulder-width apart. Face a chest-high stretch bar and grab it with both hands.


If no stretch bar is available, choose another stationary, steady object, like the handle of a closed door or the edge of a desk. Ideally, the object should also be between waist and chest height.
Cross your wrists while grabbing the bar. Your left hand should grab the bar from the right, and your right hand should grab the bar from the left. Using this type of grip should help steady the rest of your body.

, Gently ease your legs and buttocks back, pushing them as far as they will go without causing pain. Your upper body will gradually lean forward and toward the bar.


In this position, you'll be working on your lats (back), shoulders, and hips. You should feel the muscles in these areas stretch as you move into position.
Only push yourself to the end range of your back muscles. You should feel some muscle discomfort, but you should not feel any actual pain.

, Remain in this leaning position for a full 30 seconds before gradually rising up and forward.


During the first 15 to 20 seconds, only the muscles in the targeted areas will stretch. Afterward, the muscles will relax, allowing the connected ligaments to stretch.
Ease yourself back into a relaxed, upright position over several seconds. Jerky movements could potentially cause injury.

"
"
Hold something steady.,
Bend your right leg back.,
Hold the position for 30 seconds.,
Repeat with the left leg.",How to Stretch Ligaments4," While facing a stretch bar or similar object, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees loose. Grab the stretch bar with your left hand.


If you do not have a stretch bar, use the handle of a closed door, the edge of a desk, or any other stationary, steady object between waist and chest height.
You'll start by stretching the ligaments in the right half of your lower body, so you'll need to grab the stretch bar with your left hand to maintain proper balance. When stretching the ligaments in the left side of your lower body, grab the bar with your right hand.

, Slowly bend your right knee and lift your right foot toward your back. Bring the right foot to the leg's end range, then hold it with your right hand.


In this stance, you should be able to work on your quads (thighs) and knees. You should feel the muscles in both areas stretch to the point of mild discomfort, but not to the point of pain.
Your back and left leg should remain straight, but do not lock your left knee. Every part of your body other than your lower right leg should continue facing the bar.

, Keep your leg bent back for 30 complete seconds, then gradually lower it back down to the floor.


The first 15 to 20 seconds of the stretch will target the muscles, but afterward, the muscles will relax and the ligaments will begin to stretch.
Return your right foot to the floor over several seconds. Avoid using sudden or jerky movements since they may cause more damage to the area.

, Repeat the same procedure with the left leg. Bend it back to its end range, hold for 30 seconds, and gradually release it.


While stretching the left leg, hold onto the bar with your right hand and hold your foot in place with your left hand.
Switching sides will allow you to target and stress the ligaments in both legs.

Keep water bottles everywhere.,
Find hygiene shortcuts to make life easier.,
Consider getting a caregiver.,

Find ways to distract yourself from the pain.,
Do what makes you happy.",How to Survive with ME CFS," Make sure that you have protein on hand, and cut out as many preparation steps as you can, so as to make it easily accessible. For example, you may be used to buying chicken breasts and cooking them yourself, but it may be a better use of energy to buy a rotisserie chicken.;
, Keep frozen dinners on hand, as well as protein bars. Frozen vegetables are much easier to quickly heat up in place of dealing with fresh ones, and you'll still get a lot of good nutrients from them.

, If your ability to get around the house comes and goes, keep things like protein bars and jerky near you at all times.

, If this type of planning ahead is too much work for you, consider a program that is able to deliver meals to you on a daily basis. They will also check in on you, and make sure that you are not stuck on the floor. Missing a meal may have disastrous consequences for your overall health, which is likely already very fragile.

, Keep a case in every room. Water bottles are better than cups, because you don't have to worry about keeping them upright. If you cannot get up, it is important to have water on hand, so be sure to plan ahead.


Consider adding an electrolyte mix, as many people with this disease experience Orthostatic Intolerance or Postural Orthostatic Hypotension.The electrolytes can help keep your blood pressure stable, and relieve some of these symptoms.

, Hygiene can be difficult to maintain. You are likely having enough trouble getting food for yourself, so hygiene may not feel very important. Take care of your hygiene needs when you are on the up-swing of the cycle. To help yourself, try some of the following suggestions:


Consider cutting your hair short to save trouble. If you have long hair that you cannot brush for a few days, it will take a colossal amount of energy to de-tangle all of the matting.
Keep a toothbrush nearby, with a bowl if you cannot get to a sink.
It is smart to have floss where you normally eat, because having things in your teeth can greatly contribute to headaches.
Consider getting an inflatable basin for washing hair. You can have clean hair even if you can't leave bed! Otherwise, dry shampoo may be a good option.
Wet wipes may also help if you cannot get into the shower.

, If you are lucky enough to have a caretaker or care provider, you may have a better option. Let this person know what particular needs you would like addressed and formulate a plan together that lets this happen in a way that preserves your dignity, minimizes the pain and helps you to feel better.

, To keep your place of living relatively clean, try not to make too many messes. This is a good strategy, because moving things takes energy twice: once to move them, and again to put them back.


Consider grilling, so that you don't have any dishes or dirty counters. Use parchment paper, too, so that your counter stays clean. Or, do a one-pot meal, so that only one pot gets dirty and can be left to soak until the next day.
Some items can be purchased that will do cleaning for you, such as robotic vacuums and mops. If you can't afford these, find someone you know who owns one and ask them if it's possible to borrow it occasionally.

, Many people have a cleaner for their home, to free up time to do other things. Moreover, it's standard to get help whenever you're injured or ill, so if you can afford it, do not feel guilty about making use of such help.


If you cannot afford household help, ask family members and friends if they're willing to give an hour or two of help here or there. With a group of people dropping by to do discrete tasks around the house, you can get a lot done without feeling as if you're expecting too much from anyone.

, Find things to do that don't require a lot of energy but occupy your mind and help you to focus on something beyond the pain.


If you can read, read. Sign up for your library's homebound program, or read ebooks to save the energy of leaving home.
If you can watch movies, do!
If you can play games on a digital device, this can be a source of soothing yourself. However, be very careful not to play too long or to sit in an awkward position, as your muscles will begin to hurt.
If you have a pet that is willing to stay with you, stroke the pet and talk to it. If you're up to it, brush the pet's fur. Spending time with a pet can be a peaceful and uplifting exercise.
People watch. If you have a room with a view, watch what people are doing outside; this can help you to feel connected with people as you observe their comings and goings.
Use scents in your room that you find pleasing. This can help you to feel a little happier than the stale odor of your room. Be sure to open the window to let in fresh air whenever you can. If this is hard to do, have somebody fix the window to make it easier to open.

, Do whatever you can to pull your mind away from the suffering. If it works for you, then it's appropriate.

,
Try acupuncture.Acupuncture (a treatment in which a patient’s skin is punctured by thin needles at precise points on the body) is thought to be an effective pain reliever in many cases.,
Consider herbal treatments.A variety of herbal treatments are traditionally thought to ease pain and/or to have anti-inflammatory properties.",How to Stop Aching in Your Bones," Aching bones can be more than just an annoyance. Pain in your bones can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, so talk to your doctor right away if you are having bone pain. Potential causes of aching bones include:


Paget’s Disease of the Bone
Solid Tissue Cancer
Sickle Cell Disease
Multiple Myeloma
Osteomalacia (softening of the bones, often caused by a vitamin D deficiency during a time of bone growth)Other cancers such as breast or prostate cancer. Bone pain from cancer may start with a dull or deep ache that may come and go at first, but gradually becomes persistent.LeukemiaFractures (including hairline fractures)
Overuse or overexertion
Arthritis
Obesity
Osteoporosis (bone pain is not common with this condition, but it is possible);
, Your doctor can provide a more specific diagnosis and treatment plan if you let him or her know about the symptoms you have been experiencing. Pay attention to exactly when and how your bones hurt, and be prepared to answer your doctor’s questions, like:Where does it hurt?
When does it hurt? At night? During the day?Does the pain move, or stay in one place?
How long have you been experiencing aching bones?
Have the aches gotten worse?
Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

, Some examinations and tests can help determine what is causing your aching bones, and how to treat them. These tests may include:Blood draws (such as for a CBC, or “Complete Blood Count”)
X-rays of your bone(s)
A CT or MRI scan
Assessment of your hormone levels
Urine studies
Dexa scan
Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels

, Your doctor can suggest one or more for you to take. Many over-the-counter options are available, but always use them as directed by the label or your doctor. Common anti-inflammatory medications include:


Acetaminophen
Naproxen
Ibuprofen
Aspirin

, You can ensure you are getting enough vitamin D in a number of ways.


The amount of vitamin D a person needs varies by age, but ranges from 400-800 International Units (IU) per day.Those with osteoporosis or women past menopause will need 800 international units of vitamin D daily
Vitamin D supplements are available at pharmacies, supermarkets, health stores, and many other locations.You can also eat foods high in vitamin D, including: oily fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), egg yolks, fortified cereals and breads, and many milks and yogurts.Getting adequate exposure to sunlight is important, because your body needs it to help process vitamin D. However, overexposure may be harmful, so talk to your doctor about how much sunlight exposure you should have.

, If you have aching bones, the pain may be linked to a calcium deficiency. In any case, you should ensure that you are getting an adequate amount of calcium in your diet.


The amount of calcium a person needs per day varies widely by age.For example, infants need between 200-260 mg, children 700-1000 mg, and teenagers 1300 mg. Many adults need around 1000 mg a day; however, women over 50 need 1200 mg a day. Postmenopausal women and those with osteoporosis need to take 1200 mg of calcium every day divided in two or three doses.
Calcium supplements are available at pharmacies, supermarkets, health stores, and many other locations.
You can also eat foods high in calcium, including: dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), kale, broccoli, fish with soft, edible bones (such as salmon and sardines), and certain fortified foods (including some grains, breads, cereals, pastas, juices, etc.).

, In other cases, an infection may be linked to an underlying cause for which aching bones are also a symptom. If your doctor determines that your bone pain is related to an infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics to combat it.


Make sure to take the antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your doctor, and for as long as you are told to. You should continue to take the antibiotics as long as you are told to, even if the pain or other symptoms disappear. This helps to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated.

, In some cases, aching bones can be caused by or linked to a deficiency of one or more hormones. Your doctor will run tests to see if this is the case for you. If it is, he or she may prescribe a treatment plan (often hormone injections) to make up for this deficiency, and ultimately ease your aches.


Always carefully follow your doctor’s instructions regarding hormone treatments.

, Heat will increase blood flow to the sore area, soothing it as a result. Cold will provide relief by numbing the sore area, and reducing any swelling. You can choose whichever method feels best to you, or alternate between the two. You can apply heat or cold to the aching area using several methods.


Apply a cold pack (available at pharmacies and many other stores) to the aching area. Make sure to put a towel over your skin to protect it, rather than just setting the cold pack directly on the site of pain.
Apply a homemade ice pack (put some ice cubes in a sealed plastic bag) to the aching area. Make sure to put a towel over your skin to protect it, rather than just setting the ice pack directly on the site of pain.
Wrap warm towels around the aching area.
Put a sock filled with uncooked rice in the microwave for one minute to form a quick and easy heat pack. Make sure to put a towel over your skin to protect it, rather than just setting the rice heat pack directly on the site of pain.
Take a warm bath or shower.

, In some cases, your aching bones may be caused by overuse, overexertion, or poor posture.Physical therapy treatments may help ease your aches, and encourage you to move, sit, and stand properly. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about developing a program to help you.

,, Its effectiveness for treating bone aches is unclear, although some research indicates it may help some causes, such as osteoarthritis.

, The effectiveness of herbal treatments—generally, or to treat aching bones in particular—has not been well-studied in many cases. However, you may investigate one or more herbal treatments instead of or in addition to other methods to relief bone pain (look for them at supermarkets, pharmacies or herbal and health stores).


White willow bark has effects that are similar to aspirin’s.
Some research indicates that turmeric has an anti-inflammatory effect.
Green tea has long been recognized as an antioxidant and now as an anti-inflammatory as well.
Research indicates that a substance in chili peppers known as capsaicin has an anti-inflammatory effect.
Always talk to your doctor about your plans to take any herbal supplement or treatment, since they can have side effects or interfere with other medications you are taking.

Visit your doctor.,
Discuss treatment options.,
Confirm that you can and should apply splints yourself.",How to Splint Trigger Finger1," If you hear or feel a crackling or popping sound/sensation when you extend your finger or thumb, it is a good bet that you have trigger finger. However, it is vital that you have this diagnosis medically confirmed, especially if you have not had the condition previously. You need to rule out other, possibly serious, conditions.Your fingers extend and bend by way of tendons, which are essentially flexible bands that stretch and retract to move the attached bones. They are protected and lubricated by tendons sheaths (basically tubes). If a tendon sheath becomes inflamed (due to repeated use or another medical condition), it can narrow and cause the tendon to scrape or even get caught in place, causing the locking, popping, and crackling sensations of trigger finger.
Being female and/or over age 40, and having diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis can make you more susceptible to trigger finger. Most often, though, it is suffered by people who use repeated gripping motions with their hand(s), such as carpenters, farmers, factory workers, and musicians.
It is important to go to the doctor to diagnose trigger finger, because sometimes people mistake a fracture or dislocation for the condition. Your physician can determine the severity and proper treatment of your condition, and can also rule out potentially-dangerous infections that can occur at the site of inflammation.;
, Treatment for trigger finger can range from rest to surgery, depending on severity. Splinting is a common first-level treatment, especially for milder forms of the condition.Studies indicate that splinting for a period of around six weeks is roughly as effective as a cortisone shot in the joint, another common treatment for trigger finger.There are several types of splints and you can splint your finger continuously or only during times of rest. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment option for you., Before try to splint your finger, confirm with your doctor that you can and should splint your affected finger(s) yourself. Self-treatment without proper medical advice is not recommended.Splint your finger temporarily until you can receive proper medical attention. Do not engage in long-term splinting on your own initiative, however.
Improper or prolonged splinting can cause joint damage, obstructed blood flow, and/or skin infections.

Visit and speak to the person often.,
Bring photos with you.,
Stimulate long-term memories.,
Speak to them as to any other person.,
Learn about aphasia.,
Assist in physical therapy.,
Find out more about trauma recovery therapy.,
Do things together that your loved one enjoys.,
Include your loved one in activities and everyday life.,
Motivate, but don't demand.,
Don't think or say ""He/She can't"".",How to Speed Up Recovery After a Stroke," For many patients, seeing people who they are close with in their daily lives can help them recall memories formed before the stroke occurred. Apart from that, patients with a good emotional support network and a positive attitude generally have a better chance of healing well. Showing your love and support helps your loved one regenerate as well as possible.;
, Similar to the point mentioned above, reminding the person of people, pets, and events in their life before the stroke can help restore memory, as well as ease the access to the skills that person used. If you can't visit often (daily would be most beneficial), ask the medical staff to keep the photos close by and show them to your loved one daily. Write the names of the people in the picture on the back, i.e. ""Dave's birthday. Dave is your son. He is 20 years old and is holding your dog, Rex"".

, Bring up memories from long ago to help the brain re-establish synaptic connections. This means singing nursery rhymes the person knew when they were little, for example, or showing them childhood pictures. The more familiar the memory is, the better.

, Don't assume just because your loved one cannot speak or has trouble communicating, that they don't understand you or that they are mentally impaired. Many stroke patients have full mental abilities, but may experience ""locked-in syndrome"", meaning that they cannot speak or express themselves to their surroundings. It is terrible to be fully mentally aware and be treated like a child or a thing. Treat them with the same respect as before and assume that they understand you.

, If your loved one can't speak, he or she might suffer from aphasia. This means that they are intending to say a certain word, but a ""wrong"" connection in the brain makes them use another, which may or may not be related to the subject they are trying to speak about. The correct word is ""blocked"" in their vocabulary. For example, they might want to watch TV, and repeatedly say ""show"" while indicating a square shape with their hands. However, they might mean to say ""TV"" and come out saying ""exact"" instead, which has no obvious relation to television. It is often difficult to know whether the aphasia patient is using similar words to hint at what they need or not. When you figure out what it is they are trying to say, they usually don't have trouble repeating the correct word. However, it might take a lot of exercise for it to be committed to memory. Be patient. Keep in mind that their ability to understand you and build opinions is still completely intact.

, Your loved one will most likely have to do exercises to regain their physical ability. The neurological connections from the brain to the limbs are considered a ""two-way street"", meaning that even though the patient may not be able to willfully move a certain body part, moving it for them by picking it up and performing the movement while asking them to picture doing it in their mind's eye as well can help support the recovery. The individual progress is strongly dependent on the intensity of the brain damage sustained.

, Having a stroke does not only cause physical, but emotional trauma in the patient and their surroundings. Your loved one is experiencing intense feelings of physical helplessness, which is a severe shock to someone who has always been self-sufficient. They are being cared for by strangers in the hospital who may or may not understand their needs. They have to ask for things they used to be able to do whenever they wanted. If they have issues with communication, they experience intense anxiety about being understood. If they are being treated like a child or a ""vegetable"", this leads to intense anger, frustration, sadness, and despair. Find a psychologist or therapist specialised in trauma recovery, more precisely ""somatic experience therapy"". This can help patients deal with a traumatic injury and help them cope with the changes it has brought about for them.

, Even though they might not be able to move independently, try to create experiences that tie in with the person's likes before the stroke. For example, if your loved one was a rocker/biker, drive his/her motorcycle to the hospital and obtain permission to take them outside (if they are well enough to do that) to see and touch the bike. Speak about shared memories relating to motorcycles if you can. The powerful positive memory can bring about a lot of progress. Once your loved one is well enough to do so, help them participate (for example by renting or buying a by-wagon and taking them along when you and/or other biker friends go for a ride).

, After hospitalization ends, include your loved one into day-to-day activities as much as possible. Not only will this help them recover further, but create a positive attitude and help them enjoy life . The living conditions might be different and they may need help, a shower seat, a cane, or other items to ease daily tasks, but their life is not over.

, There is no guarantee for a full recovery after a stroke. Never assume that your loved one ""should be walking by now"" or feel resentment towards them for their level of ability. They did not choose this change in their life, or to be dependent on the goodwill of others to meet their needs. Motivating them by showing love, complete acceptance, and the knowledge that they are still the same person on the inside, will help them avoid depression or cope with their own grief at the loss of the plans and dreams that they may now have to change.

, As in the motorcycle example above, everything fun in life can still be done. It might be different than before, but never impossible. If your loved one enjoyed cycling before, but their balance is too impaired for using a bicycle, get them a tricycle. If their feet won't stay on the pedals, help them out with Velcro loops. If they only have dexterity in the fingers of the right hand, attach their bell and brakes on the right and wire them differently. Anything that lets them participate in activities they love will help them get as well as they possibly can.

Secure the finger to the splint by taping around the base of the finger.,
Pinch the nail of the injured finger for three seconds.,
Avoid getting the splinted finger wet.",How to Splint a Finger," In severe cases, the force applied to the finger can be strong enough to cause bones in your finger to break. This type of damage will require more intensive treatment than a splint., These sensations are signs that the injured area is not getting enough blood flow and oxygen. You may also have nerve damage in your finger as a result of the injury., Do not make a splint for this level of injury at home. This is an indication that your finger is fractured or dislocated. A part of your finger may also appear to point in the other (wrong) direction, and it may appear shorter or longer than the opposite, healthy finger on your other hand. The finger will also likely be swollen, painful, and stiff.


You may also notice bruising on the finger due to broken tiny blood vessels, and a sharp pain when you touch it.
Your doctor will examine your broken finger, and get your hands x-rayed. X-ray is a non-invasive procedure and will help your doctor visualize the condition of the bones in your hands.
Once your doctor applies the splint, avoid disturbing the splint so it can correct the injury., These are all indications of a sprained finger, which you can treat at home with a splint.Usually, injuries to the finger occur on the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) which are the joints found near the tip of the finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) which are the joints found at the midpoint of the finger.Sprained fingers usually heal after 2-4 weeks. Avoid applying pressure or weight on the injured finger to speed up the healing process.

, Wash the wound with soap and water to avoid infection.Put 3-4 drops of povidone- iodine (betadine) solution on a cotton ball and apply it to the entire wound.
Let it dry.

, If you end up using cardboard, make sure they are firm pieces of cardboard and not flimsy or floppy.If you can’t find two similar object, its fine to use two different objects as long they are both straight and firm, about ½ inch wide.

, If you are using two pieces of cardboard, make sure both pieces are long enough to cover your injured finger.


If the injury is on the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) or the joints found near the tip of the finger, measure the length of your finger by placing the tip of the tape measure on the tip of the finger going to the midpoint of the finger.
If the injury is on the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) or the joints found at the midpoint of the finger, start to measure from the tip of the finger up to the base.

, Cut two pieces: one to be put on the top and one on the bottom of the injured finger. Make sure each piece of cardboard can cover the entire bottom and top area of the injured finger.

, You should have your chosen two straight, narrow objects (preferably two pieces of cardboard), a tape measure, a roll of medical tape, and scissors.

, Put one splint at the top of the finger. Then, put one splint at the bottom of the finger.


Using the medical tape, wrap at least 2-3 layers around the tip of your finger. Then, wrap at least 2-3 layers of medical tape around the bottom of your finger.
Tape between the first and second knuckles of the injured finger.
Make sure you do not move or bend your finger when applying the splint as further movement will cause further injury. Keep your finger as straight as possible.

, Do not wrap the medical tape too tight or too loose around your finger. If the tape is too tight, it will impede blood circulation to your finger. Your finger may turn slightly blue and the pain may become more intense. If the tape is too loose, the finger will not be stabilized properly, so you will be able to move your finger around inside the splint. Neither scenario will benefit your injured finger.Pinch the nail of your injured finger for three seconds to determine the blood circulation. The splinted finger has good blood circulation if it returns to its pinkish appearance in less than three seconds. If it does not turn pink after three seconds, the splint is likely too tight and restricting blood flow. Remove it and reapply or adjust it as necessary., Tape the two fingers together to give your injured finger more support.


Wrap at least 2-3 layers of medical tape around the tip of the two fingers. Then, wrap at least 2-3 layers of medical tape around the bottom of the two fingers., Commercial splints are available in various sizes and contain openings to allow proper ventilation. If you can purchase one yourself, the fitting of the finger splint is easy, but if you cannot purchase it in person and need to get a friend or family member to buy you one, measure your injured finger so it will fit properly.


Commercial splints have sizing information on their package such as small, medium or large.
To measure your finger, get the circumference or the measurement around the affected finger using a tape measure. If the injury is on the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP), determine the length of your finger by placing the tip of the tape measure on the tip of the finger going to the midpoint of the finger. If the injury is on the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP), measure from the tip of the finger up to the base of the finger., The most common splint available is the fold over finger splint.

, You should have your chosen commercial splint, a roll of medical tape, and scissors.

, Then, insert the commercial splint onto the injured finger until it fits perfectly and comfortably. Keep the affected finger in a straight position.If you are using a fold over finger splint, you will slide your injured finger into the bottom of the cushioned splint. The folded part of the splint should be at the tip of the finger.
If the broken finger is at a strange angle and cannot be straightened, go to the doctor immediately.

, Make sure the tape touches the skin so it is secured properly.


Put two layers of tape at the top of the finger and two layers of tape at the bottom of the finger.
Once you are done wrapping the finger with tape, cut the tape using scissors.

, This will determine the blood circulation of the splinted area. If the nail has a pinkish appearance in less than three seconds, the splinted finger has good blood circulation. If the nail does not appear pink after three seconds, the tape or the splint are too tight, causing ineffective blood flow.If it is too tight, remove the finger splint and reapplied it until it feels snug, rather than too tight or too loose.

, This can make the skin around the injury moist and itchy, increasing the risk of skin breakdown and the development of wounds, which can become infected if they come in contact with the dirty surface of the splint.When taking a bath, cover the splinted area with a double layer of plastic and tape the edges so it won’t get wet.

Know when to use the buddy splint.,
Prepare the necessary materials.,
Determine what two fingers to buddy splint together.,
Place the splint under the trigger finger.,
Grab your tape.,
Check the circulation of the buddy and affected finger.,
Wear the splint for four to six weeks, or as recommended by your doctor.",How to Splint Trigger Finger2," This splinting technique is often used for trigger finger when a finger ligament is strained or when a joint is dislocated. Buddy splinting is not suitable for unstable joints and/or fractured fingers.A buddy splint adjoins two fingers by taping them together, just like buddies. The fingers are taped at a point which is above and a point that is below the affected joint.
Please note: contact your physician before engaging in long-term splinting for apparent trigger finger or any other condition.

, Before you apply a buddy splint, you will need to gather some materials. You will need:Scissors. You will need scissors for cutting the medical tape and for cutting the wood pieces, if necessary.
Two tongue depressors or Popsicle sticks. Any wood that is thick enough to support a finger will do. Typically, tongue depressors can be found in any local pharmacy — just make sure that it will support the entire length of the finger.
Medical tape. This secures the wooden splint to the fingers. Micropore tape is easy and gentle for sensitive skin. If you want very adhesive tape, you can purchase Medipore or Durapore instead.

If you do not have the tape at home, you can use thin strips of cloth about 4 to 5 inches long to secure the splint; however, medical tape is preferable. You will need a half-inch width cloth tape, which can be found at pharmacies near you.



, If the index finger is not broken or injured, avoid using it. It's your most useful finger and you don't want it hindered by the splint if it doesn't have to be. If the middle finger is affected by trigger finger, then choose the ring finger as the buddy.You want your hand as mobile as possible. If you can buddy with the ring or pinky finger, do so. You'll experience less inconvenience if your index and/or middle finger are free.

, Be sure to cover the entire length of the affected finger. After placing one tongue depressor (or similar device) underneath the finger, you should place another on top of the finger. Basically, your finger will be in the middle of a wooden stick sandwich.Trim the wood to size so that it does not catch/destabilize the splint once it is in place.
You can buddy splint with just tape, but using a structural support like the wooden sticks makes the splint much sturdier and more effective.
Only splint the injured finger — the buddy finger can be left alone.

, Using the scissors, cut two pieces of tape, each measuring 10 inches (25 cm). Here's how to wrap your finger:Wrap the first piece of tape once around the trigger finger, in between the first and second knuckles.
Bring the piece of tape around the buddy finger and wrap it firmly until the tape runs out.
Repeat in between the second and third knuckle of the affected finger, and then around both fingers. If the your little finger (pinky) is affected, you must wrap it at the end of the finger, which will line up between the second and third knuckles of the ring finger.

, Pinch the nail of each finger for about two seconds. Does it return to a pinkish appearance within a couple of seconds? If so, good. The blood circulation is just how you want it. Your splint is then finished.If it takes more than two seconds, then your fingers are not getting enough blood because your splint tape is too tight. Removing and reapplying the buddy splint is the best thing to do in this situation.

, In certain cases of trigger finger, it may take only two to three weeks to heal. However, the average time is a bit more. Ultimately, it depends on the extent and severity of the inflammation in the tendons of your affected finger.If you are lucky, your doctor will only recommend that you wear the splint at night or while otherwise resting. This is much less inconvenient than continuous splinting.
Whether splinted at all times or just sometimes, avoid using your injured hand (and especially the injured finger) as much as possible. Immobilization is key to a speedy recovery.
When the splint (and tape) is dirty or becoming loose, replace the splint with a new one.
If after this period of time your trigger finger does not seem any better, consult your doctor again. He or she will conduct further assessment and properly treat your finger.

Know when to use a static splint.,
Put the splint on the trigger finger.,
Cut your tape into two 10"" (25 cm) pieces.,
Check the circulation of the affected finger.,
Use the splint for four to six weeks.",How to Splint Trigger Finger3," Static splints support, protect, and straighten injured fingers by way of form-fitting piece of metal, plastic, etc. They are used in cases of trigger finger in order to hold a joint in place, regardless of whether it is just slightly bent or completely out of alignment. Since a proper fit is key to a static splint, it is best to accurately measure the length and diameter of the affected finger before choosing the splint.Static splints can be bought over the counter at pharmacies and supermarkets. They are made from basic metal, plastic and foam.
Please note (again): You should consult your doctor first before using a static splint for anything less than short-term protection. Among other benefits, the doctor can help ensure that the splint is the proper type, size, and fit for your injury.

, Straighten the injured finger by supporting it with the other hand. Slowly slide the static splint along the underside of the trigger finger until it fits into place.Make sure to check if the static splint fits completely and the finger is really straight. If the finger is slightly bent either forward or backwards, it can lead to the development of sores at the knuckle.

, Wrap the first piece of tape firmly once around in between the first and second knuckles of the trigger finger until the tape runs out.Repeat in between the second and third knuckle of the affected finger until the tape runs out.

, Do this by pinching the nail for about two seconds. If the nail returns to pinkish appearance within one to two seconds, then it has good blood circulation.


If it takes more than two seconds, the blood flow is insufficient because the splint is too tight. Removing and reapplying the splint is the best option.

, This is the average time it takes a trigger finger to heal. For some people it will heal in only two to three weeks time; it depends on the extent and severity of the inflammation in the tendons. Make sure to change the tape twice daily or as necessary.Depending upon your injury and your doctor's advice, you may only need to use the splint while sleeping/resting. This is more convenient, of course, but full-time splinting will likely provide better protection and healing.
When the splint and tape becomes soiled and dirty, replace it with a new one.
If trigger finger does not resolve after four to six weeks, you should contact your primary health provider for further assessment and management

Know when to use a stack splint.,
Place the splint on your finger.,
Use tape if necessary.,
Check the circulation of the trigger finger.,
Keep the splint on for four to six weeks.",How to Splint Trigger Finger4," These specialized preformed splints are used in trigger finger cases when the joint that is closest to the tip of the finger (called the distal interphalangeal joint ) is damaged or cannot straighten by itself.Stack splints (one common brand is known as Stax splints) come in various sizes. They are designed to fit over the DIP joint in order to prevent it from bending, while still allowing bending of the joint at the midpoint of the finger (the proximal interphalangeal joint ).
Stack splints are usually made from plastic with holes for ventilation. They can be found in pharmacies or grocery stores and you can try to fit them there before purchase.
Please note (once more): Despite their availability and relative convenience, it is always best to consult your physician before using stack splints to address trigger finger or another condition (such as mallet finger).

, To do so, straighten the affected finger while supporting it with the other hand. Slowly slide the stack splint onto the affected finger until it completely fits.Make sure to check that the stack splint fits completely and the finger is really straight. If the finger is slightly bent either forward or backwards, it can lead to the development of sores at the knuckle. If the stack splint has a built in adjustable strap, you can use that to secure it in place without taping.

, Using scissors, cut a ten inch (25 cm) length of medical tape. Wrap it firmly around the finger and splint beyond the first knuckle.Some stack splints have built-in adjustable straps, so taping is not necessary.

, For just a couple of seconds, pinch the nail of your trigger finger. This will cut off the blood flow and turn it white. Then let go. If the nail becomes pink within one to two seconds, then it has good blood circulation and your splint is on correctly.


If it takes more than two seconds for the blood to return to the area, your splint is on too tight. Your finger needs adequate blood flow to heal. Remove and reapply the splint, adjusting for tightness.

, Unfortunately, the average trigger finger takes this long to heal. In mild cases, it may heal in only two to three weeks time; however, it greatly depends on the injury and the extent and severity of the inflammation in the affected trigger finger.Because they only immobilize the top of your finger, stack splints are somewhat less obtrusive than other splints. It may therefore be more possible to keep them on at all times without major inconvenience. This is likely the best option for proper healing, but consult with your doctor.
Immobilization is imperative. In order for your finger to heal, try to keep from using it as much as possible.
Replace/re-position the splint (and tape) when they become dirty, the tape starts to peel up, or if it becomes too loose to be effective.
Visit your doctor after four to six weeks (or as previously advised) if your finger hasn't healed. He or she will be able to give you the proper management skills to take care of your injured trigger finger.

Limit processed and prepared foods.,
Include complex carbohydrates.,
Reduce your processed sugar intake.,
Increase your fiber.,
Increase fruits and vegetables.,
Eat white meats.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Choose lower calorie foods.,
Cook with herbs.,
Control your portion sizes.",How to Reverse Prediabetes1," Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as possible. This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods. Cook from scratch as much as possible.Processed foods sometimes contain huge amounts of sugars. For example, one teaspoon of sugar is equal to about four grams. One six ounce serving of low-fat yogurt has 28 grams, which is seven teaspoons of sugar in one serving of yogurt. One tablespoon of pure honey has only 16 grams.;
, Whenever you eat carbohydrates, make sure they are complex, and not simple, carbohydrates. While both simple and complex carbohydrates are broken down into glucose in the body, it takes the body longer to break down the complex carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods such as whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.Go for brown rice, whole grain pasta, and whole grain breads if you want to eat those items.


Avoid simple carbohydrates. A good rule of thumb is no white foods. No white bread, white pasta, white potatoes (like french fries), or white rice. Also avoid candies, cookies, cakes, bagels, donuts, and other confections. Many breakfast cereals also have simple carbohydrates.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates at breakfast or lunch. Cut down on the portion sizes of complex carbs for meals later in the day to prevent your blood glucose levels from getting too high at night.

, Processed and refined sugars are simple carbs that should be avoided. Make sure to read the labels of all foods, not just sweets. Sugars appear in many common items, like pasta sauce, ketchup, salad dressings, and breads.


Be especially careful with beverages. A significant amount of people’s daily sugar intake is from drinks. Stay away from fruit juice, Koolaid, fruit drinks, vitamin waters, and sports drinks. Instead, drink unsweetened tea, water, and coffee — but skip the sugar-loaded coffees from chains.Drink diet soda instead of regular soda. Regular soda has an enormous amount of sugar in it and is one of the worst things you can drink. Though, be aware, diet soda has its drawbacks, too.
Although reading labels can be useful to determine the amount of sugars in a food, manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. You can avoid any added sugars by sticking to unprocessed foods.
Simple carbohydrates are often found in added sugars, like glucose, sucrose (table sugar), and fructose, most often added as high fructose corn syrup., Increasing the fiber in your diet helps make you feel fuller and helps digestion. It also helps your body remove fats and other metabolites in your stool. Fiber is found in fruits and vegetables, including leafy green vegetables, along with beans and legumes., You should increase the fruits and vegetables you eat every day. Fruits and vegetables contain essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Go for vegetables that are less starchy, like broccoli, leafy greens, carrots, and green beans. Eat at least three servings a day.Eat fruit in moderation. The sugars in fruit are combined with the fiber, which means that the absorption of sugars from the fruit are slowed down. But you still want to reduce your sugar intake. Eat one to three servings each day.

, Limit the red meats in your diet, like beef, steak, lamb, pork, and deli meats. Instead, increase the amounts of fish and skinless poultry you eat. Look for wild-caught fish, such as salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna.Reducing red meats is not directly connected to your blood sugar level; however, type 2 diabetes is often part of a larger set of conditions known as metabolic syndrome. Reducing cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and losing weight (which may be helped by cutting out red meat) can decrease your risk of metabolic syndrome and, therefore, your risk of diabetes.


These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory.

, Good fats include polyunsaturated fat and some saturated fats (dairy fat) and are found in nut oils, nuts, and seeds can actually protect against metabolic T2D. Bad fats include trans fats, and are found in margarine, prepackaged baked goods, fried food.Eat olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oils. Avocados, walnuts, macadamia nuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, and most other seeds and nuts are good sources for healthy fats.
Beware of anything containing partially hydrogenated oil.

, Instead of eating high-calorie foods, go for lower calorie options. Snack smarter by putting away high-calorie chips, crackers, and junk food. Instead, eat wheat crackers, natural peanut butter, or fruits and veggies., There are a large number of herbs that may help control blood sugar levels, though more research is necessary. Add these herbs to taste whenever you want. These herbs may help you get over some of those sugar cravings as well.Good herbs are:


Cinnamon
Fenugreek
Ginger
Garlic and onions
Basil
Bitter melon

, Overeating can lead to obesity, which can lead to your body being insulin resistant, and eventually to T2D. Control how much you eat at meals. Use a smaller plate, like a salad plate. Refrain from eating seconds. Eat slowly and savor each bite.Try not to eat at all-you-can-eat buffets.
Think about what your plate looks like. Half the plate should be fruits and vegetables. One fourth should be a complex carb, like brown rice or a sweet potato. The remaining fourth needs to be a lean meat, like baked chicken or grilled fish.

Talk to your doctor about dynamic splints.,
Have your splint fitted and applied.,
Schedule follow-ups.",How to Splint Trigger Finger5," Dynamic splints are the most complicated of all finger splints, because they are often spring-loaded and always custom fitted. This means that they are not universal and require further assessment by the physician first. To splint your trigger finger with this method, you'll need to see your doctor.Unlike other splints, dynamic splints use tension to actively engage the flexing and positioning of the injured finger. They are, in a matter of speaking, on-hand physical therapy.
Dynamic splints are only worn during rest or periods of inactivity, usually for just a few hours at a time. This allows for correct positioning of the muscles, ligaments, and tendons, which need to be in a relaxed state.

, Once your doctor recommends a dynamic splint and selects the proper type and fit, he or she will apply it. Here's what will happen:The physician will advise you to straighten the affected finger while supporting it with the other hand. Some situations require the finger to be slightly bent depending on the position to be corrected.
The physician will now fit the dynamic splint onto your trigger finger until it completely fits.
Further assessment will be made by the physician to correct positioning, alignment and proper fit. He/she will also check the pulse to see if the site has good circulation.
He/she will instruct you to bend the affected finger. It should return back to a straight position because of the spring attached to the dynamic splint.

, Proper instruction will be given by the physician regarding how long the dynamic splint needs to be used. Once everything is completed, schedule a follow-up check-up in order to assess improvement of your injured trigger finger.If you experience any complications, such as poor circulation, unusual pain in the digit, numbness, or tingling, or the splint doesn't seem to be effective, visit your doctor before your scheduled follow-up. It will likely just require a quick realignment of the splint.

Drink plenty of water.,
Lose weight.,
Increase your daily activity.,
Find a support group.",How to Reverse Prediabetes2," Increase the amount of water you drink. Try to get about six to eight eight ounce glasses of water a day. Water not only helps with digestion and flushing out toxins, it has no sugar. Replacing sugary drinks with water can make a significant difference.Some people say drinking water helps them feel full and not as hungry.

, Losing body weight when you have prediabetes can significantly lower your chances of getting diabetes. You don’t even have to lose a lot. Losing five to 10 percent of your body weight can lower your chances of diabetes over 50%.If you weigh 300 pounds, losing 10 percent of your body weight is only 30 pounds, and five percent is only 15. If you weigh 250, 10 percent is 25 pounds, and five percent is 13 pounds. These totals are not so large that they are unattainable. You can safely reach these goals.
Make sure to lose weight healthily. Extreme weight loss measures, like unhealthy diets or not eating, can negatively affect your blood sugar levels. One to two pounds a week (which can be achieved by cutting out 500 calories a day) is a safe pace for weight loss.If you make the diet changes to reverse prediabetes, you should start to see weight loss. Eat a healthier diet, which means including more fruits and vegetables, complex carbs, and lean proteins. You should limit sugar, refined carbs, fried foods, processed foods, and other junk foods.
Another healthy way to lose weight is to increase your physical activity. These can be small changes, like taking a walk each day, increasing the duration of your walk, or the number of days you walk. You can also start taking stairs, dance around your house, do a workout tape, swim, hike, or anything else that gets your moving and your heart rate up.
Talk to your doctor about a diet and exercise plan if you are unsure how to start.

, Increasing your physical activity moderately can help reverse prediabetes. You don’t have begin a strenuous routine. Simple changes and small increases in activity level can help. Try for 30 minutes of activity, a mixed activity if you want, at least five days a week.Start slowly so these changes become permanent lifestyle choices.


Find an activity that you can commit to. Walking, climbing more stairs, doing more outdoor activities, hiking, gardening, aerobics, using an elliptical, rowing machine or stationary bicycle and stretching are all examples of moderate physical activity.
Park your car further from the office, or get off the elevator two to three floors early and walk the rest of the way. The next week, park further and get off the elevator four to five floors earlier.
Start with 10 minutes of activity a day and begin adding on minutes every week. You may be quite amazed at how quickly the time passes. Don’t forget to warm up, especially if you are trying to jump right into it.
Consider joining a gym and getting a personal trainer. Make sure you know and understand any physical conditions that may limit your activity and find a trainer to help you get around those conditions safely.

, Making lifestyle changes, staying on track, and losing weight is difficult. Find people who will cheer you on, help keep you accountable, and offer support. This can be family or friends, or a diabetes support group."

See your doctor often.,
Know who is at risk.,
Know the symptoms of prediabetes.,
Know that prediabetes can be reversed.",How to Reverse Prediabetes3," If you have been diagnosed with prediabetes, you should let your physician know how you have changed your diet to improve blood sugar control, lose weight, and reverse prediabetes. Get regular checkups, every three to six months, including blood tests as advised by your physician.Keep track of your labs so you can see how well you are doing and celebrate your progress.

, Certain factors make people more at risk for prediabetes. People at risk for prediabetes are:People who are overweight or obese.
People who exercise infrequently.
People who are older than 45 years old.
People with a family history of diabetes.
Women with a history of gestational diabetes.
African Americans, Mexican Americans, American Indians, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans, Often, there are no symptoms of prediabetes. If you see a physician regularly and have your blood tested, your physician may notice that your blood sugars tend to be on the high side, but not high enough to diagnose T2D. You may display symptoms of diabetes or have diabetes related problems with prediabetes.Fasting blood sugar levels between 100 to 125 mg/dL are suggestive of prediabetes.
Your doctor may also measure Hemoglobin A1C to test for prediabetes. This is a three-month average of blood sugar levels. Normal is under 5.7. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made if two consecutive A1C tests are over 6.5. Patients with A1C between 5.7 and 6.5 have prediabetes.
One early sign that is a risk for T2D and that may signal prediabetes is a skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans. In acanthosis nigrican, the skin around the neck, armpits, elbows, knees, and knuckles get darker.You may also experience increased hunger, thirst, fatigue, weight gain, or increased urination.

, Just because you have prediabetes does not mean you will have type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can be reversed by losing weight. You can also reverse the effect by changing the way you eat and exercise.


It is believed that almost all type 2diabetes could be prevented with diet and nutrition."

Exercise moderately.",How to Restore Glycogen," The carbohydrates in your diet are broken down to create glucose. Dietary carbohydrates provide the basic components needed to keep glucose in your blood so you have enough energy for your daily routines.When your body senses that you have extra glucose, it converts the glucose to glycogen by a process called glycogenesis. The glycogen is stored in muscle and liver tissue.As your blood glucose levels begin to run low, your body converts the glycogen back to glucose by a process called glycolysis.Exercise can deplete the glucose in your blood more quickly, causing your body to pull on the reserved glycogen.;
, Anaerobic exercise involves short bursts of activity, such as weightlifting and muscle development and training. Aerobic exercise involves longer episodes of sustained activity that cause your heart and lungs to work harder.During anaerobic exercise, your body uses the glycogen stored in the muscle tissue. This causes you to reach a point of muscle exhaustion when you do several sets of repetitive muscle training exercises.Aerobic exercise utilizes the glycogen stored in your liver. Prolonged aerobic exercise, like marathon running, causes you to reach a point where those stores are depleted.When that happens, you may not have enough glucose in your blood to properly fuel your brain. This can result in symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, including fatigue, poor coordination, feeling dizzy, and problems with concentration., Your body has a two hour window immediately following exercise during which it more effectively restores your glycogen.Simple carbohydrates include foods and beverages that are easily broken down by your body,such as fruits, milk, chocolate milk, and vegetables. Foods prepared with refined sugars are also sources of simple carbohydrates, such as cakes and candies, however these sources lack nutritional value.Research suggests that consuming 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours increases the rate of restoring the depleted glycogen stores. This method increased the rate of replacement from an average of 2% per hour, to 5% per hour., Consuming 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours will take from 20 to 28 hours to completely restore the amount of glycogen depleted.This factor is considered by athletes and their trainers in the days immediately prior to an endurance event., Athletes work to develop higher levels of endurance in order to compete in events like marathons, triathlons, cross country skiing, and distance swimming events. They also learn to manipulate their own glycogen stores to compete more effectively.Hydration for an endurance event begins about 48 hours before the big day. Keep a container filled with water on you constantly for the days leading up to your endurance event. Drink as much as you can during those two days.Begin your high-carbohydrate eating two days before the event. Try to select high-carbohydrate foods that also have nutritional value. Examples include whole grains, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain pasta.Include fruits, vegetables, and lean protein in your meals. Avoid alcohol and processed foods., Carbo loading methods are used by athletes that participate in endurance events, or events that last longer than 90 minutes. Carbo loading involves timing and selection of foods high in carbohydrate content to help expand the glycogen stores beyond their average levels.Completely depleting the glycogen stores prior to the event, then loading with carbohydrates, works to expand the glycogen storage capacity even further. This allows the athlete to push harder and further, and hopefully improve his performance during the event.The most traditional method for carbohydrate loading starts about a week before the event. Change your regular diet to include about 55% of your total calories as carbohydrates, with protein and fat added in as the remainder. This depletes your carbohydrate stores.Three days prior to the event, adjust your carbohydrate intake to reach 70% of your daily calories. Decrease your intake of fat, and reduce your level of training.Carbo loading methods are not reported to be helpful for events that are less than 90 minutes., By doing so, the body will work to quickly change the carbohydrates into usable energy, providing even greater energy benefit., Drinking sports beverages during an athletic event can help by providing a continued source of carbohydrates to your system, plus the added caffeine, available in some products, helps to improve endurance. Sports drinks contain sodium and potassium to maintain your electrolyte balance.Recommendations for sports beverages consumed during long periods of exercise include products that have from 4% to 8% carbohydrate content, 20 to 30 mEq/L of sodium, and 2 to 5 mEq/L of potassium., Insulin and glucagon are hormones made by the pancreas.Insulin works to move glucose into the cells of the body for energy, remove excess glucose from the blood stream, and convert the excess glucose to glycogen.Glycogen is stored in muscle and liver tissue for later use, when more glucose is needed in the blood., When the blood level of glucose drops, the body signals the pancreas to release glucagon.Glucagon changes the stored glycogen back into usable glucose.The glucose pulled from the glycogen stores is needed to provide the energy we need to function each day., In people that have diabetes, the pancreas does not function normally, therefore hormones like insulin and glucagon are not adequately produced or released in the body.Inadequate levels of insulin and glucagon means that the glucose in the blood is not properly pulled into the cells of tissues to be used as energy, the excess glucose in the blood is not adequately removed to be stored as glycogen, and what is stored as glycogen cannot be pulled back into the blood when it is needed for energy.The ability to utilize glucose in the blood, store it as glycogen, and then access it again, is impaired. Therefore, diabetics are at greater risk of developing hypoglycemia., While anyone can experience hypoglycemia, patients that suffer with diabetes are more susceptible to episodes of abnormally low levels of glucose in the blood, otherwise known as hypoglycemia.Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include the following:Feeling hungry
Feeling shaky or nervous
Feeling dizzy or light-headed
Sweating
Sleepiness
Confusion and difficulty speaking
Feelings of anxiety
Feeling weak

, A severe and untreated hypoglycemic episode can lead to seizures, coma, and even death., Since the pancreas does not function normally, oral and injectable medications can help.Medications work to provide the balance needed to help the body properly perform both glycogenesis and glycolysis.While the available medications are saving lives every day, they are not perfect. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing hypoglycemic events, even by simple changes in their daily routine.
In some cases, the hypoglycemic events can be severe and even life-threatening., Even the smallest change can cause unwanted results. Talk to your doctor before making any changes in your food choices and exercise routine.If you are diabetic, altering the foods you eat, the amount of foods and beverages you consume, and changes in your level of activity, can result in complications. For example, exercising, which is an important part of diabetic health, can create problems.During exercise, more energy, or glucose, is needed, so your body will try to pull from your glycogen stores. Impaired glucagon functioning causes less than adequate amounts of glycogen to be pulled from the stores in muscle and liver tissue.This can mean a delayed, and possibly severe, episode of hypoglycemia. Even several hours after exercise, the body will continue to work to restore the glycogen used during exercise. The body will pull the glucose from the blood supply, triggering a hypoglycemic event., Hypoglycemia comes on fairly quickly in someone that is diabetic. Any signs of dizziness, fatigue, confusion, difficulty comprehending a statement, and having trouble responding, are warning signs.The initial steps to treating a mild hypoglycemic episode involve consuming glucose or simple carbohydrates.Help the diabetic person to consume 15 to 20 grams of glucose, as gel or tablets, or as simple carbohydrates. Some food items that can be used include raisins, orange juice, sodas with sugar, honey, and jellybeans.As the blood sugar returns to normal, and enough glucose is getting to the brain, the person will become more alert. Continue to provide foods and beverages until the person recovers. If there is ever any question about what to do, call 911.

, People with diabetes may want to have a small kit prepared that contains glucose gel or tablets, possibly injectable glucagon, plus simple directions for someone else to follow.The diabetic person may quickly become disoriented, confused, and unable to treat themselves.Have glucagon available. If you are diabetic, talk to your doctor about having injectable glucagon available to help manage any severe episodes of hypoglycemia.The glucagon injection works like natural glucagon, and helps to restore the balance of glucose in your blood., A diabetic person having a severe hypoglycemic episode will not be able to administer the injection.Friends and family members, educated about hypoglycemia, will know how and when to proceed with an injection of glucagon.Invite your family or friends to an appointment with your doctor. The risk of not treating a severe episode of hypoglycemia goes beyond any risk associated with the injection.Your doctor can help to reassure your caregivers of the importance of treating a hypoglycemic episode.Your doctor is your best resource and guide. He or she can help you decide if your condition warrants having a glucagon injection available to treat potentially serious hypoglycemic events. Glucagon injections require a prescription., Talk to your doctor to be sure this type of weight loss plan is safe for you.Understand the risks. To safely pursue a highly restricted carbohydrate diet, which usually involves consuming less than 20 grams per day of carbohydrates, you must factor in your level of activity.The initial period of a low carbohydrate diet significantly restricts the amount of carbohydrates a person is to consume. This helps your body to tap into stored glycogen as an aid in losing weight., Ask your doctor about safe time limits specific to your body type, level of activity, age, and existing medical conditions.Limiting the highly restricted carbohydrate intake for 10 to 14 days allows your body to access the energy it needs while exercising, using blood glucose and stored glycogen.
Resuming a higher carbohydrate intake at that time helps your body to restore the glycogen used., Your body pulls the energy it needs from the glucose in your blood, then pulls from glycogen reserves stored in your muscle and liver. Frequent and intense exercise depletes those stores.The carbohydrates in your diet restore your glycogen.By extending the highly restricted part of the low carbohydrate diet beyond 2 weeks, you are preventing your body from accessing the natural substances, meaning carbohydrates, needed to restore your glycogen., The most common result is feeling tired or weak, and having episodes of hypoglycemia.You have depleted most of your glycogen stores and you are not putting very much back into your bloodstream. This results in less than enough energy to function normally and problems pursuing intense exercise., After the initial 10 to 14 days of the low carbohydrate diet, move to a phase that allows for more carbs to be consumed, which allows your body to restore the glycogen., If you are trying to lose weight, incorporating routine exercise is a great step to take.Participate in moderate aerobic activity that lasts for more than 20 minutes. This helps you to lose weight, use enough energy to tap into your reserves, but avoid depleting your glycogen stores."

Note instances of chest pain.,
Watch for signs of atypical angina.,
Monitor any shortness of breath you experience.,
Take note of abnormal heart rhythms.,
Be aware that CHD can lead to heart attacks.",How to Spot Symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease1," Chest pain (angina) is the earliest sign that you might be developing coronary heart disease (CHD). Angina is better described as a strange or unexplained pain felt in the chest area. Some people describe it as discomfort, tightness, heaviness, pressure, burning, aching, numbness, squeezing, or fullness in the chest. The pain may travel through your neck, jaw, back, left shoulder, and left arm. Since these areas share the same nerve pathways, the pain from the chest will usually radiate to these areas. You might feel chest pain during activities, heavy meals, when you strain for any reason, and when you are in an extremely emotional state.If CAD is the cause of your chest pain, then the pain is a result of too little blood flowing to your heart. This typically occurs when demand for blood flow is highest, hence the association with angina and physical activity in early stages.Angina typically presents with other associated symptoms, including shortness of breath or difficulty catching your breath, dizziness or palpitations, fatigue, sweating (especially a cold sweat), upset stomach, and vomiting.;
, Atypical angina means symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, breathlessness, fatigue, dizziness, numbness, nausea, tooth pain, indigestion, weakness, anxiety, and sweating, which can present without the usual chest pain. Women and diabetics have a higher chance of presenting atypically.Atypical angina also has an increased “unstable” occurrence, which means it presents at rest rather than simply with exertion and carries an increased risk of heart attack., Shortness of breath generally happens in the late stages of this disease. Coronary heart disease reduces the heart's ability to pump blood through the body, leading to congestion of the blood vessels. When this occurs in the lungs, you feel short of breath.Talk to your doctor if you feel like you can’t catch your breath when you are doing simple exercises, such as walking, gardening, or doing household chores.

, An irregular heartbeat is also referred to as arrhythmia.This can be described as feeling like your heart skips a beat or speeds up every once in a while. You can also feel an irregularity in your pulse. If you feel this irregularity coupled with chest pain, go to the emergency room.In cases of CAD, heart arrhythmia occurs when decreased blood flow interferes with the electrical impulses to the heart.The most severe form of arrhythmia associated with CHD is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) wherein the heartbeat isn’t just abnormal but stops entirely. This usually leads to death within minutes if the heart cannot be restarted, usually by means of a defibrillator., The worst complication stemming from CHD is a heart attack. People who are in the late stages of coronary heart disease are much more at risk of having a heart attack. The pain in your chest will become more severe, you will have a hard time breathing, you might feel nauseated and anxious, and you will break out in a cold sweat. You should call an ambulance immediately if you think you or a loved one is having a heart attack.A heart attack may sometimes be the first sign that you have CHD. Even if you have never had other symptoms of heart disease, seek medical attention for any type of severe chest pain or shortness of breath, as it could be a sign of serious health issues such as CHD.
Sometimes a heart attack can present with atypical symptoms such as anxiety, fear of something terrible about to happen, or a heaviness in the chest.Any unusual symptoms that come on suddenly need to be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible.

Evaluate your energy levels.One of the most common signs of potential hypothyroidism is fatigue, and/or a recent drop in your energy levels.,
Observe any recent weight changes.Hypothyroidism may also cause you to gain weight, again because your metabolism is slowed down below its normal level.,
Notice how you feel in the cold.Another potential consequence of hypothyroidism is an intolerance of cold weather, meaning that you feel less able to handle being out in the cold.,
Consider any changes in your skin, hair, or eyes.Hypothyroidism can lead to signs such as drier, thicker skin (from the glycosaminoglycan deposits in your tissues); a lack of sweating (due to decreased metabolism); fewer, coarser hairs on your body or eyebrows; and/or brittle nails.,
Watch for changes in your mood or sleep habits.For some, hypothyroidism can manifest as a depressed mood.,
Take note of unusual constipation.Hypothyroidism can also lead to constipation.,
Be aware of any unusual shortness of breath.Sometimes hypothyroidism can cause you to be short of breath, particularly during exertion.,
Be on the lookout for other potential signs.Hypothyroidism can manifest in a variety of different ways, and varies from person to person.",How to Spot Early Signs of Hypothyroidism1," Because the thyroid is directly related to your metabolism, hypothyroidism correlates to a slower metabolism which can lead to a feeling of fatigue and sluggishness.;
, If you have been gaining weight lately for a seemingly unexplainable reason, it is possible that this is related to hypothyroidism.

, When your metabolism is slowed (as it is in hypothyroidism), you cannot generate the same internal heat to keep yourself warm.

, If you are noticing any of these things, especially in conjunction with other more common signs, and symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain, book an appointment with your doctor to have your thyroid tested.

, For others, it can lead to unusual snoring and/or fitful sleeps with awakenings during the night (as sometimes hypothyroidism can lead to concurrent sleep apnea).

, If you are having bowel movements fewer than three times per week (over a period of at least three weeks), or significantly less than your normal, consult your physician. This may or may not be related to hypothyroidism; either way, it is something that is beneficial to speak up about as your doctor can help you to manage this problem.

, If you are finding it harder than normal to catch your breath walking or working out at the gym, it may be a sign of thyroid abnormalities. (If it is not hypothyroidism, unexplained shortness of breath is still a concern that should be evaluated by your physician.)

, Signs that occur less frequently (but may still be indicative of hypothyroidism) include:


Mild swelling around the eyes
Menstrual irregularities in women
Mild high blood pressure (this will require a doctor's evaluation)
Elevated cholesterol (this will require a doctor's evaluation)
Memory lossCognitive dysfunction (memory, concentration)
Hoarse voice
Leg swelling
Slow heart rate

Consider your age.,
Consider your sex.,
Look at your family history.,
Examine your nicotine use.,
Test your blood pressure.,
Take into account if you’re diabetic.,
Try to reduce your cholesterol.,
Consider your weight.,
Evaluate your stress levels.",How to Spot Symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease2," Damaged and narrowed arteries can simply be a result of age. Those 55 and older are at an increased risk. Of course, bad health choices—such as poor diet or not getting enough exercise—coupled with old age, can increase your chances of developing the disease as well., Generally speaking, men are more likely to develop CHD than women. However, even women are at an increased risk once they finish menopause.Women also typically have less severe, atypical symptoms of CHD. They tend to have sharper, burning chest pain, and are more likely to experience pain in their neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. If you are a woman who experiences any abnormal sensations or pains in your chest or shoulders, or if you have trouble breathing, talk with your doctor as these could be early warning signs of CHD., If any close relatives had a history of heart disease, then you are at a higher risk for CAD. If a father or brother was diagnosed earlier than age 55 or if a mother or sister was diagnosed before age 65, then you are at the highest risk., Smoking is one of the primary culprits for most CHD cases. Cigarettes contain nicotine and carbon monoxide, both of which force the heart and lungs to work harder. Other chemicals in cigarettes can damage the integrity of your heart’s arterial lining. According to studies, when you smoke, you increase your chance of having CHD by 25%.Even using e-cigarettes (""vaping"") can have a similar effect on your heart. For your health, avoid all forms of nicotine., Consistently high blood pressure can cause hardening and thickening in your arteries. This narrows the channel for blood flow and makes the heart work harder to circulate blood through the body, resulting in a greater risk for CHD.A range for normal blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg. Blood pressure isn't always the same and can vary in a short period of time., People with diabetes have blood that is thicker and more viscous, which is harder to pump through the body, meaning your heart has to work overtime. People with diabetes also have thicker atrial walls in the heart, which means that the heart’s passageways can block more easily., High cholesterol results in the buildup of plaque on the atrial walls of your heart.High cholesterol also means that there will be more fat deposits placed in your blood vessels,making your heart sluggish and more prone to disease.


Both high levels of LDL (so-called “bad” cholesterol) and low levels of HDL (“good” cholesterol) can also result in atherosclerosis., Obesity (a BMI of 30 or greater) typically worsens other risk factors since obesity is tied to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and developing diabetes., Stress can cause your heart to work harder because your nervousness and stressed excitement makes your heart beat faster and heavier. People who are always stressed out are much more likely to develop heart-related diseases. Stress increases your risk of blood clots and causes your body to release hormones that raise your blood pressure, too.Turn to healthy sources of stress relief, such as yoga, Tai Chi, and meditation.
Daily aerobic exercise not only strengthens your heart, it can relieve stress.Avoid turning to unhealthy substances such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, or junk food to deal with stress.Massage therapy may help you battle stress."

See your doctor.,
Take a stress test.,
Connect to a heart monitor.,
Test your cardiac enzymes.,
Take x-rays.,
Undergo cardiac catheterization.,
Take medications.,
Discuss balloon angioplasty.,
Ask about rotablation.,
Discuss bypass surgery.",How to Spot Symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease3," If you are experiencing severe chest pains or what you think might be a heart attack, then you should call 911 and visit an ER immediately. For less severe symptoms, see your doctor as soon as possible. In either scenario, a medical professional will have access to the equipment necessary to make a proper CHD diagnosis.


Describe your symptoms in detail to your doctor, including what seems to bring them on, anything that makes them worse, and how long they last.

, For less immediate cases, your doctor may order a stress test to help diagnose CHD. This will involve monitoring your heart while having you exercise (typically run on a treadmill) in order to look for signs of abnormal blood flow.

, An EKG (or ECG) will continuously monitor your heart. A professional at the hospital will look for changes associated with ischemia (your heart not receiving enough blood)., If you are in a hospital for monitoring, the staff will likely check the levels of cardiac enzymes called troponin, which the heart releases when damaged. Expect three different test of these levels spaced out by eight hours.

, X-rays can show signs of heart enlargement or fluid in the lungs due to heart failure if you were rushed to the hospital. In some instances, your doctor may order an x-ray in addition to heart monitoring.

, For certain abnormalities on the other ordered tests, you may end up speaking with a cardiologist about having a cardiac catheterization. This means the cardiologist will feed a wire with dye into your femoral artery (a major artery located in your groin and running to your legs),. This process allows the team to produce an angiogram (pictures of the blood flow in the arteries)., If your doctor feels that your specific case doesn’t require surgery, you will likely be put on medications to help manage your CAD. Aggressive cholesterol management has been shown to shrink some coronary plaques (atheromas), so your doctor will likely find a cholesterol medication right for you.If you also have high blood pressure, then your doctor will prescribe one of the many medications available for the condition, based on your specific case history., For narrowed arteries that are not yet blocked, your doctor will likely discuss the option of angioplasty. This procedure involves your doctor threading a thin tube with a balloon attached to the end into the affected artery. By inflating the tiny balloon at the site of the narrowing, the balloon pushes the plaque out against the wall of the artery and restores blood flow.The increased blood flow will reduce the associated chest pain and reduce the amount of damage done to your heart.
Your doctor will likely put a stent, or small mesh tube, into your artery during this procedure. This can help keep your artery open after the angioplasty.Coronary stent placement is sometimes done as its own procedure, too.

, Rotablation is another type of non-surgical procedure to help clear arteries. It uses a tiny, diamond-coated drill to sand plaque out of the artery.It may be used on its own, or as a complementary procedure with angioplasty.This procedure may be used with high-risk or elderly patients., If the left main heart artery (or a combination of two or more arteries) have severe blockage, then the cardiologist will likely discuss bypass surgery with you. The procedure involves harvesting healthy blood vessels from your leg, arm, chest, or abdomen in order to bypass the blockages in your heart.This is a very serious operation that typically involves spending up to two days in an intensive care unit and up to a week in the hospital total.

Quit smoking.,
Get your blood pressure checked regularly.,
Exercise regularly.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Eat fish at least twice a week.,
Avoid excessively fatty foods.",How to Spot Symptoms of Coronary Heart Disease4," If you smoke, then the number one thing you can do to prevent CAD or CHD is to quit. Smoking puts added stress on the heart, increases blood pressure, and leads to other cardiovascular complications.Those who smoke a pack a day are at twice the risk of a heart attack as non-smokers.About 20% of all heart disease-related deaths in the U.S. stem from smoking., In fact, you can check your blood pressure once a day from the comfort of your home. Talk to your doctor about the device that he or she thinks would be best for you. Most of the at-home blood pressure devices involve you putting the device on your wrist, holding your wrist out in front of you at heart level, and then checking your blood pressure reading.


Ask your doctor what your normal, resting blood pressure is. This will give you a standard to compare your daily readings to.

, Because coronary heart disease is a cardiovascular (aka heart) issue, you should do cardiovascular exercises to strengthen your heart. Cardio exercises include running, walking briskly, swimming, biking, or any other exercise that elevates your heartbeat. You should try to exercise for at least 30 minutes every day.


Speak with your doctor before beginning any exercise regiment to make sure it's appropriate for your health and fitness levels. She can usually even recommend options that are tailored to your specific needs.

, The healthy diet should consist of heart-healthy foods that also keep your weight and cholesterol at a healthy level. A balanced diet should consist of:High quantities of fruits and vegetables containing balanced daily intakes of vitamins and minerals
Lean proteins such as fish and skinless chicken
Whole grain products, including wheat bread, brown rice, and quinoa.
Low-fat dairy products such as yogurt.
Less than 3 grams of salt a day to reduce your chances of developing high blood pressure

, In particular, you should get fish that is rich in omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 reduces the risk of inflammation in the body, which in turn reduces your chances of getting inflamed blood vessels that can lead to heart disease. Fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids include:Salmon, tuna, mackerel, trout, and herring

, If you are concerned about your heart’s health, you should stay away from foods with high amounts of saturated fats or trans fats. These raise your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad,"" cholesterol levels and can clog your arteries and lead to heart diseases.Sources of saturated fat include red meats, ice cream, butter, cheese, sour cream, and products made with lard. Deep-fried products are usually loaded with saturated fats.
Trans fats are usually found in fried and processed foods. Shortening that is made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is another common source of trans fats.Consume fats from fish and olives. These fats are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may help lower your risk of heart attack and heart disease.
You should also avoid eating more than an egg a day, especially if you have difficulty controlling your cholesterol levels. Although eggs are usually healthy in moderation, eating too many of them may increase your risk of heart failure or heart disease.When you do eat eggs, don't load them down with fats such as cheese or butter.

Get a blood test.If you are showing signs of potential hypothyroidism, your doctor can perform a simple blood test to confirm the diagnosis.,
Obtain treatment if needed.If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, the good news is that the treatment is generally quite simple.,
Receive regular thyroid measurements.After being diagnosed and receiving initial medical treatment, you will need to go in for regular blood tests to ensure that your thyroid levels are normal.",How to Spot Early Signs of Hypothyroidism2," Normally, your doctor will check for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 (one of the hormones released from the thyroid); sometimes T3 is also tested for.


TSH is a hormone that is made by your brain that travels to your thyroid gland (which is in the middle of the front of your neck) and tells it to make thyroid hormones.
There are a number of different forms of thyroid hormone in the body termed T4, T3, etc. T4 is the main active hormone, so this is the one that is tested.
A blood test is the definitive way to diagnose hypothyroidism, and it is the only sure way to know whether or not you have the condition.

, Most people are prescribed synthroid (Levothyroxine), which is a thyroid replacement hormone (synthetic T4) to get your levels back into the normal range. Speak to your doctor to obtain a prescription for this medication if you have been officially diagnosed with hypothyroidism on your blood tests.


Synthetic T4 hormone should be taken on an empty stomach, ideally an hour before breakfast.
Note, however, that hypothyroidism treatments may not take immediate effect.
Your doctor will need to pay close attention to your thyroid levels over the first few months to determine the correct dosage of medication., If they continue to fall outside the normal range (being either too high or too low), your doctor can adjust the dose of your medication to ensure that your thyroid levels do fall within the normal range.
